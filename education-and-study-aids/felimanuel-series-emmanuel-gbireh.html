  <title>Felimanuel Series - Emmanuel Gbireh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is chiefly through books that we enjoy intercourse with superior minds. In the best books, great men talk to us, give us their most precious thoughts, and pour their souls into ours. God be thanked for books. They are the voices of the distant and the dead, and make us heirs of the spiritual life of past ages. Books are true levelers. They give to all who will faithfully use them, the spiritual presence of the best and greatest of our race.  William Ellery Channing  
Some of the things you will discover in Felimanuel Series, The Magical Secret to Success in English Language, Essay Writing for Junior and Senior High Schools Volume 1, With Bonus Success Secrets:
	The book is comprehensively, logically and coherently written and the language used is also easy to understand; hence, little or no further explanation is needed.
	The book teaches how to choose examination questions and answer them without sweat.
	Sample outlines/plans and sample essays have been written to guide pupils and students.
	The bonus success secrets will help pupils and students to pass in all seemingly difficult subjects like mathematics and science.
	The bonus success secrets will also guide pupils and students towards the attainment of greater success in life.
The book has been designed in such a way that it can be used for examination purposes and for other practical uses in the day-to-day life of whoever uses it faithfully.
In writing this book on English Language, essay writing, I decided to move away from the traditional way of some authors flooding their English Language, essay writing books with so many sample essays based  on my experiences as an English teacher some years back. Many pupils / students have the habit of memorizing written essays found in books and reproduce them during examinations, class exercises or when given project/home work when they see that the question being asked is similar to the answered one they came across. I hope the experts in the educational sector will agree with me that this does not augur well for the proper development of the child because he/she would not have the opportunity to think and plan on his /her own before writing a script with originality (I stand to be corrected if I am mistaken). It is in line with this that I have given only single sample essays per essay topic treated with more suggested outlines/plans.
Most people often fail to plan their lives and this usually have disastrous effects on them. Also in writing examination, most candidates fail to plan their essays before answering selected questions. As the old adage says, If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.
It is based on the above that in writing this book, I dedicated the first chapter to the basics of essay writing. Below is an excerpt of chapter one of the book.
After high lighting on the basics of essay writing, I went ahead to discuss what paragraphs are and how they can be used in our daily writings. This is followed by the use of punctuation marks. Here again, I have given a comprehensive write-up as to how punctuation marks can be used to enrich our written works.
Other topics covered in the book are writing of narrative essays, descriptive essays, friendly letters, semi- formal letters, summary writing, argumentative essays, speeches and talks, report writing, articles for publication, expository essays and advertisement.
After a comprehensive, logical and coherent treatment of each topic, I followed up with sample questions, outlines/plans and essays. These are only to serve as a guide to users of the book.
I will like to take this opportunity to entreat teachers to encourage pupils /students whom they teach to learn how to write an outline/plan and to use it when answering essay related questions, not only with English language, but with all other subjects that they deem it fit to apply. Some people may not see the usefulness of the outline/plan, but it helps the pupil / stude" />
