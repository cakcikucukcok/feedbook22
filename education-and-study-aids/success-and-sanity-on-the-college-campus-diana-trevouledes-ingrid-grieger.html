  <title>Success and Sanity on the College Campus - Diana Trevouledes, Ingrid Grieger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;tab-stops:left 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Written by two experienced college mental health professionals, this practical nuts-and-bolts guide for parents of prospective and current college students offers an insider&amp;rsquo;s view of the realities and complexities of today&amp;rsquo;s campus life. Recognizing that college students rank their parents as their primary source of support and advice, the authors provide parents with the specific information and recommendations they need to offer the best assistance possible. In this book, parents will learn about the most significant factors to be considered in making a wise decision about college selection, about the process of making a successful transition to college, about the potential pitfalls inherent in college life, and the warning signs and risk factors for psychological distress. In addition, parents will become acquainted with the protective factors and the resources available on the campus that enhance academic success and persistence to graduation, as well as emotional health and well-being. Throughout, parents will learn to distinguish between those situations in which they should intervene directly and those in which they should offer support from the sidelines. Parents will be able to help their student make their time in college a joyful, productive, and ultimately successful experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
