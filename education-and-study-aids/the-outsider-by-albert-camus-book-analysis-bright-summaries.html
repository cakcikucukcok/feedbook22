  <title>The Outsider by Albert Camus (Book Analysis) - Bright Summaries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unlock the more straightforward side of &lt;i&gt;The Outsider&lt;/i&gt; with this concise and insightful summary and analysis!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This engaging summary presents an analysis of &lt;i&gt;The Outsider&lt;/i&gt; by Albert Camus, which follows the antihero Meursault as he lives his life in complete disregard of social conventions and is led to kill by events that seem to be beyond his control. His refusal to lie or pretend to be something he is not in order to make others comfortable draws the ire of his fellow citizens, and his condemnation is due as much to his apparent remorselessness and lack of feeling as to his crime itself. &lt;i&gt;The Outsider&lt;/i&gt; forms part of Camus&#39;s so-called &quot;Cycle of the Absurd&quot; and is widely considered to be one of the most important books of the 20th century. Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957, and influenced writers and philosophers around the world with his reflections on the meaning of existence and the search for happiness in an ultimately indifferent world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;The Outsider&lt;/i&gt; in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;oA complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;oCharacter studies&lt;br&gt;oKey themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;oQuestions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you on your reading journey.
