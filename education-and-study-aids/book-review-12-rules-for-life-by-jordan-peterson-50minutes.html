  <title>Book Review: 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson - 50Minutes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;It can be hard for busy professionals to find the time to read the latest books. Stay up to date in a fraction of the time with this concise guide.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jordan Peterson&#39;s 2018 international bestseller &lt;i&gt;12 Rules for Life&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most talked-about nonfiction books of recent years. It takes as its starting point Peterson&#39;s belief that, by rejecting tradition and mythology, modern Western society is missing out on much wisdom that could give meaning to life. His book is an antithesis to the emptiness of much contemporary thought, with a series of 12 concrete, clearly articulated principles that have the power to increase our sense of responsibility for our own lives and enable us to find a sense of purpose in an increasingly chaotic world. With millions of copies sold to date and translations into numerous languages, the book&#39;s message has resonated with readers around the world and cemented Peterson&#39;s position as one of the West&#39;s leading public intellectuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book review and analysis is perfect for: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;oStudents of psychology&lt;br&gt;oAnyone looking for a sense of meaning in an often-chaotic world&lt;br&gt;oAnyone looking to understand the myths that shape our existence&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;About 50MINUTES.COM | BOOK REVIEW&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Book Review series from the 50Minutes collection is aimed at anyone who is looking to learn from experts in their field without spending hours reading endless pages of information.
