  <title>Be Honest: And Other Advice from Students Across the Country - Nínive  Calegari, Neko Case</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Be Honest&lt;/I&gt; is the newest innovative publishing project from 826 National, the tutoring center founded by bestselling author Dave Eggers, now with branches in eight cities nationwide. Eggers&amp;#8217;s co-founder N&amp;#237;nive Calegari, the former CEO of 826 National and a co-author of the bestselling &lt;I&gt;Teachers Have It Easy&lt;/I&gt;, presents a riveting book full of surprising insights from young people who have a lot to say to their teachers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Be Honest&lt;/I&gt; presents the first-person stories of dozens of high school students from every ethnic group and financial bracket: a girl from an immigrant family is put in an ESL class even though her English is fluent; an African American boy talks about the social pressures that prevent him from asking his teacher for help; and a privileged private school student describes his transition to public school&amp;#151;and reports that he was able to learn &lt;I&gt;more&lt;/I&gt; with the increased freedom it brought.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Through these personal narratives, teachers and activists will learn an invaluable lesson: what the classroom looks like from the other side of the desk.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
