  <title>Vessel of Steel - Angela Underwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are times in our lives when there will be failures and disappointments. What will you do when things are not going your way? Will you give up? Will you throw in the towel and say Im done? By becoming a vessel of steel, no matter what comes your way, you will be able to stand strong. You will not bend or break when difficult situations arise and things arent going the way you hoped. With persistence, dedication and hardwork, you will be able to succeed and strengthen your vessel. Vessel of Steel was written to help encourage and move you to a higher level in your life so that you may become all that you were created to be.
First you need to know your purpose; and then you must come to grips with what it will take to reach your goals.
What you pour into your vessel can help you to accomplish your dreams and become the best you can be. To avoid becoming an empty vessel, you must be willing to strive to reach your greatest potential. Life is a journey and it should be a journey of growth. Not simply going through life and experiencing different things, but learning from your experiences. In order to grow, you must learn what is necessary in your life to obtain the success that you so desire to have and deserve." />
