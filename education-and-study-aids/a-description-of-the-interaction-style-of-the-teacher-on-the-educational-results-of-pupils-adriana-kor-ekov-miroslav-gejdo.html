  <title>A description of the interaction style of the teacher on the educational results of pupils - Adriana KorČEKOVÁ, Miroslav GejdoŠ</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This monograph analyses the impact of a teacher’s interaction style on the educational results of pupils at the first stage of primary school, through research on the basis of a theoretical starting point of the issue. The theoretical part of the work draws attention to the interaction style of the teacher, gives a comprehensive view on the fundamental factors of the educational process, as well as on the school environment, in which the upbringing and the education of children takes place. The practical part of the work presents the research carried out at the 1st stage of primary schools, in the Žilina and Tren?ín regions. The obtained results correspond to the effectiveness of teaching in the 4th year of the selected primary schools, and point to the possible participation of active learning on the pupils’ educational results. It also serves to create a vivid picture about the interaction styles applied by teachers, reflecting in the effectiveness of teaching and the subsequent comparison of schools in villages and in towns.
