  <title>The Perfect Lesson - Third Edition: Revised and updated - Jackie Beere, Ian Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A revised and updated version of Jackie Beere’s bestselling The Perfect (Ofsted) Lesson (ISBN 9781781350881) covering the latest Ofsted inspection framework. An observation is only a brief snapshot of your teaching. It could turn out to be like a flattering studio portrait or like that dire passport photo from one of those booths! Either way it is just a snapshot. The aim of this book is not simply to make that brief observation look outstanding but for it to truly reflect your everyday outstanding teaching. The inspection framework aims to discover the ‘typical’ quality of the teaching that is delivered every day of the year, not just during inspection. The best way you can be ‘outstanding’ is to develop a flexible, multifaceted approach that draws on the very best ideas and which continually adapts and responds to individual learners’ needs. Here, Jackie Beere shows you how as she shares her expertise and experience in a practical, down-to-earth way; it is as much about world-class quality in teaching and learning as it is about surviving an inspection. The advice is easy to apply - no matter what subject you teach or what sort of teacher you are. Many different teachers have successfully implemented the strategies offered here and adapted them to suit their different styles, personalities and classes. With The Perfect Lesson, you can be confident of revealing your school in the best possible light and, who knows, you may even enjoy the process." />
