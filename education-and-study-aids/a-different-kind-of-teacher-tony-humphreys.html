  <title>A Different Kind of Teacher - Tony Humphreys</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recognising many of the difficulties facing teachers today, bestselling author and clinical psychologist Dr Tony Humphreys provides innovative and practical ways to bring about a more positive climate within staffrooms and classrooms.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key theme in &lt;i&gt;A Different Kind of Teacher&lt;/i&gt; is that of self-esteem. The self-esteem of both the teachers and the students is a major determining factor of the relationships between teacher and teacher, teacher and student, and student and student. The successful resolution of problems within the staffroom and the classroom needs to be based on the nature of the relationships between the members of these two school systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Different Kind of Teacher&lt;/i&gt; is a challenging book that confronts many of the traditional approaches to teaching and discipline in the classroom. Easy to follow, with key insight and key action summaries at the end of each chapter, Dr Humphreys’ fascinating book contains chapters that explore:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress in the teaching profession&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The importance of self-esteem for teachers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategies for managing staffroom relationships&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to cope with disruptive students&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best ways to control the classroom environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to implement a whole-school approach &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Different Kind of Teacher&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read for teachers, parents and anyone who wants to discover how to create a harmonious educational environment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
