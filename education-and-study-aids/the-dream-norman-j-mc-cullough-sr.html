  <title>The Dream - Norman J. Mc Cullough Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dream&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;; a Manual to Facilitate Group Mentoring and Prevent High School Drop-Outs for African-American, Hispanics, European-Americans and Others in Need of Positive Role Models in their lives is designed for individuals and groups who want to demonstrate their love for our youth in America and other locations throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The book, by way of its step-by-step and session-by-session presentation gives the reader the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of a group of young people. Although one-on-one mentoring is not discouraged, this book focuses on the benefits of group mentoring and it gives the reader the tools needed, including the raison d e tre for the selection of a group mentor who can have a positive impact on 30-40 youth over a 5-8 week period of time. Especially during this time of concern about inappropriate behavior by adults, group mentoring can provide some protection because the emphasis is on group activities and not one-on-one contact. Moreover, given the events surrounding the death of Travyon Martin, it is clear that for some communities we are talking about life and death. Trayvon was a 17th year old black male killed in February 2012. The session on the Law provides a role play about the dos and donts when confronted by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book discusses why group mentoring is needed, and the role of various parties in the group mentoring process. The role of the group mentor is key. The role of the family, mentors, media, God and others is discussed so that the reader has a clear understanding of how all the pieces must come together to develop and present a viable program. A train-the - group mentor program is also available upon request.&lt;/p&gt;" />
