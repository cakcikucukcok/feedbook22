  <title>Breaking Down the Schoolhouse Doors - Stephen V. Newton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;College students finishing their academic preparation programs face the difficult challenge of transitioning into the teaching profession. In a short period of time, they can no longer function as a student themselves and must immediately transform into a professional educator. This can be a difficult challenge for a young person and they need guidance doing this successfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The one opportunity college students have in gaining practical experience as a teacher is through the student teaching experience. Unfortunately, many students squander this critical opportunity and finish their assignment without maximizing their own learning and without capitalizing on professional opportunities that they will need to be hired as a teacher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By building a professional brand name through a thoughtful preservice teaching experience, novice educators are better able to survive the application and interview process and secure a teaching position. Capitilizing on the difficult transition point between the college experience and the school environment is more important than ever. When this is done in a systematic and thoughtful manner, educators can be certain that they are as prepared as possible to enter the demanding profession of education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
