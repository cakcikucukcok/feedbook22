  <title>The Kid Who Really Did Not Fit In - Stacie Kandra, Irene Olds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This project was originally designed as a teaching tool to be used by parents, teachers, students, and other
professionals who have the wonderful opportunity to work with kids with special needs. It gives a personal
perspective about the difficulties that students face in school and social situations. It is the perfect preparation
tool for creating a welcoming environment for all learners. Ideally, dedicated teachers utilize this tool to become
comfortable welcoming students with special needs into a general education classroom. The teaching tips in
the back and the stories throughout can be used as disability awareness training for all of the students in the
classroom. This book is written with the hope of decreasing the difficulties encountered by students with and
without disabilities in social and academic interactions." />
