  <title>They Are All Our Sons - Brad Zervas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brad Zervas observed twenty years ago that the boys we once were are the men who we becomeand the same is true today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a startling observation given that all is not well in America and around the worldespecially for young men of color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They Are All Our Sons shares a series of tragic and uplifting stories that convey five key principles that can ignite these boys. These principles will lead them to a manhood rooted in grace, dignity, respect, community engagement, familial connection, and civility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nearly forty years of experience as a leader, educator, community activist and youth advocate, Zervas shares lessons from relationships with boys who have succeeded and soaredas well as insights from those who have been distracted, lost, and forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our nation faces a crisis of epic proportions, and it is time to recognize that these boys have value and merit our love, attention, and commitment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
