  <title>The Multi-age Learning Community in Action - Barbara Cozza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As schools struggle to teach all students, the multi-age teaching and learning framework has emerged as one of today&amp;rsquo;s most effective ways to structure schools. Multi-age Learning Community (MAC) Program is a professional development program in action. It presents a framework that can transform schools from a graded system to a multi-age learning environment. This multi-age school targets students&amp;rsquo; individual and personal needs and allows students to excel and succeed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The school reform climate today focuses on schools of choice and building effective school environments. This multi-age program creates a unique school niche that is marketable to families. Parents have the option of sending their children to schools that concentrate on achievement that best meets the needs of the learner without disrupting the mandates of the curricula.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; This book is intended to assist educators at all levels of all school organizations, as well as give policymakers, educators and parents the information on an effective school program. This book gives information on how to transform schools into multi-age classrooms. This book is divided into four parts that explain both the theory and the practice of effective strategies for the multi-age school program: Organizational Practice, Building Culture, Learning Processes, and Assessment and Systemic Improvement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are specific basic principles and practices that are integrated into a quality and effective framework discussed in the chapters of this book. Each chapter begins with a vignette based on my experiences in multiage schools and concludes with an educator&amp;rsquo;s reflection to recap the concepts in the chapter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each chapter also integrates &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;snapshots &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;short real-to-life passages that bring to life concepts discussed in the chapter.

To accommodate all school programs, at the end of each chapter, a section titled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Application for All Schools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a framework that discusses just how to apply chapter concepts in any school or classroom program. It is recommended that the reader review the book one time in sequence and then reread each chapter as needed, to give meaning to the reader&amp;rsquo;s purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
