  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant’s Option B - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant’s Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy includes a summary of the book, review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: Part memoir and part pop psychology presentation, Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant is about the struggles that Sandberg faced after her 47-year-old husband’s unexpected death in 2015. Option A—the life that Sandberg always thought she would have—was to grow old with her husband. Option B was to figure out how to live her best life without him.
Sandberg and her husband, Dave Goldberg, were on vacation, celebrating a friend’s birthday in Mexico when he died. They’d been married 11 years, and had two young children. (At the time of his death, the kids were staying back with Sandberg’s parents in California.) After Dave was missing for a few hours, Sandberg and two other people found him unresponsive. He couldn’t be resuscitated, and it was a 30-minute ambulance ride to the nearest hospital. Dave died—instantaneously, as it turns out, from a massive cardiac event—but Sandberg wouldn’t learn that until later." />
