  <title>Summary: Inbound Marketing - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The must-read summary of Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah&#39;s book: &quot;Inbound Marketing:&amp;nbsp;Get Found Using Google, Social Media, and Blogs&quot;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This complete summary of the ideas from Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah&#39;s book &quot;Inbound Marketing&quot; shows that customers today are getting far better at ignoring outbound marketing aimed at them. They have spam folders, recording devices to fast-forward through adverts and caller ID on their phones. This summary demonstrates that far better results can be achieved by inbound marketing, where your customers find you, or you are recommended to customers by a trusted source. Therefore, social media, blogs and search engines have become all-powerful tools. The great news for companies, is that this doesn’t require the vast investment of the ad campaigns of the past. You need to establish your message with care, but getting it out there needn’t be extortionate. It also explains how to convert people from visitors, to prospects, leads, opportunities then customers through specific messages at specific times. Inbound marketing is also a way of analysing your customers. By using social media such as Twitter, you can ask people directly how they would improve your product.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added-value of this summary:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Save time&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Understand key concepts&lt;br&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Increase your business knowledge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To learn more, read &quot;Inbound Marketing&quot; and discover a cheaper and more effective method that can help you create a better product without costly market research.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;" />
