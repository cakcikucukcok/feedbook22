  <title>Correct English in 24 Hours - Yinka A. Amuda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Exercises in this booklet deal with common errors which are committed by students of English Language. The solutions to the exercises should be used by the students to verify the correctness of their own answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All phrases are compiled and gathered from speakers who acquired English as a second or third language. This publication as a whole is specially compiled to help speakers of other languages improve their English studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although it is especially useful for adult learners, ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages), EFL (English as a Foreign Language), EAL (English as an Additional Language) students; junior, senior, middle school children who are learning English will benefit from its usage. Students who are studying other courses such as Business English and Postrgaduate Management will also benefit from Correct English in 24 Hours in order to improve their English Language skills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This publication is also a useful resource for teachers of English Language. Even in countries where English is the first language, native speakers, especially primary and secondary school children still need help with grammar and literacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although grammar schools are not common today, English language (rather than merely literature) needs an equal if not more focus, especially in the school curriculum; a publication like this will assist those endeavours." />
