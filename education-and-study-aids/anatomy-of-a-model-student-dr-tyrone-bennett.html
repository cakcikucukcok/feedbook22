  <title>Anatomy of a Model Student - Dr.Tyrone Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The attempts of fixing our nations school system since 1964 have not been a walk in the park.  Several legislations and laws have been reformed to improve ways to implement the improvement plans in our school system. Looking back at the anatomy of our education system in the last fifty years brings up very few solutions as to what direction is righteously affordable for the next generation. Whether you talk about equality of education or legislation for the common standards for K12, what really matters is how well our next generation of youth is ready for the twenty-first-century workforce and/or college pathways.
This book was written on behalf of students, teachers, and parents, who lack the understanding, guidance, stability, and hope in the twenty-first-century educational system. This is a system of turmoil. We have seen changes over the last fifty years, yet millions of students from elementary to freshmen year in college are suffering academically. Many are failing, and few are making the grade. Our nation ranks below the top 20 worldwide in math and science, and we are not moving fast enough to change it. 
 It is very important to note that students of all ages can benefit from this book to improve their education and get the much-needed support academically through counseling and mentoring. Parents and students need advisement. Students need to know what tools are available to succeed in their academic affairs, and parents need to know if those tools are adequate. Education is the key for success, and perseverance unlocks the door. This book opens the door to a rewarding career and best decision making for a prosperous future and allows students to grasp a better understanding of what it means to be educated. This book gives the essence of where we were and where we are headed. Many students dont know how to study and lack the understanding of why reading is important. Millions of students come to school with raw minds and starving brains. This book looks at the mind of a teenager and the brain. In this book, youll learn about proper nutrition that will enhance the mind and spark the thinking cells. As you read this guide, you will learn more and more answers to readiness for the twenty-first-century workplace and the needed skills to succeed. Anatomy of a Model Student dares to speak out on whats wrong with todays youth and behavior issues that hinder learning. This book is the bible of educational fitness for parents and educators alike. It will empower, encourage, and mesmerize its readers, so please read it to be wise, practice it to be educated." />
