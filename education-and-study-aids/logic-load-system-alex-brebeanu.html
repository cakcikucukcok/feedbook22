  <title>Logic Load System - Alex Brebeanu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Revolution in Weight training  this should really be the title of this book. Because the system promoted in this book, simply called Logic Load System, is the future of training and every single person that goes into a gym, from a beginner level up to a high performance athlete, will use it as an ultimate system of training, a complex tool to enhance their performances with a mathematical precision.
Logic Load System presents the latest research in Weight training. Whether you are designing a Strength &amp; Conditioning routine for a certain sport or a Bodybuilding session, Logic Load System will provide you with over 30 methods of manipulating the weight and the repetitions, with a mathematical precision, in order to give you the best results and also to build up and plan your sessions over a training cycle.
If so far, athletes were just randomly added plates on the bar, usually when increasing from one set to another, with the same ratio, regardless the level of preparation, Logic Load System will teach you how to customize the weight and the repetitions according to your level (beginner or advanced athlete) and stage of preparation ( preparatory, precompetitional, competitional or transition). 
At the moment, most athletes are using mainly 2-3 methods of increasing and/or decreasing the weight from set to set :
- increasing the weight every set
- increasing the weight every second step  
- increasing and then decreasing the weight 
Moreover, the weight is increased with 5kg, 10kg, 15 or 20kg, as this is pretty much the weight of the plates in most gyms. Consequently, the athletes are expecting to gradually increase their overall effort  which is often a false affirmation. If nobody asked themselves why increasing it with 5, 10, 15 or 20 kg, now is the time to do so, because there is nothing wrong with 4, 12, 16 or 18 kg (for example)
Logic Load System will clearly explain you with practical examples and graphs why and how much to increase the weight and gradually increase the overall effort from set to set, instead of just randomly throw plates on the bar with no logic in it whatsoever and yet expecting the best results.
There are no two athletes with perfectly the same level of fitness and therefore the training should be different from athlete to athlete. Increasing the weight with 30 kg has a different effect on a beginner athlete as opposed to an advanced athlete.  Logic Load System will teach you how to customize the weight and the reps to fit your current level of preparation and to prepare you for further improvement. 
Now is the time to stop being a follower. It is the time to make it work for you and be in charge of your own progress.
On the same note, most of the athletes are using the same patterns of repetitions when increasing the weight from set to set. A common pattern is 12 reps -10 reps  8 reps  6 reps. Whether you are aiming for strength, power or hypertrophy, this is regarded as being the universal answer to achieve the best results  one pattern fits all purposes. 
To claim that 4 or 5 sets at a pattern of 12 reps  10 reps  8 reps  6 reps is the best pattern for EVERY athlete is totally illogic. 
To claim that there is only one way to achieve your goal, is more than irrational. 
To claim that increasing the weight from set to set with the same ratio, regardless the stage and the level of athletes preparation is totally ignorant. 
This approach has to change and Logic Load System is the only system in the world that will show you why and how to do it.
Again, it is more than sure that is nothing wrong with a pattern  of 11-9-7-5 reps, for example, but I very rarely saw athletes performing this pattern as we tend to perform a pattern of even number of repetitions, avoiding the odd numbers repetitions as being  to odd 
As is not only how hard an athlete could train, but also how smart, Logic Load System will demonstrate you how many reps should be performed and, m" />
