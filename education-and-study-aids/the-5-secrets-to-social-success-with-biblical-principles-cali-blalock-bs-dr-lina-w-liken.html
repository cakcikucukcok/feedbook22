  <title>The 5 Secrets to Social Success with Biblical Principles - Cali Blalock Bs, Dr. Lina W. Liken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Its obvious that a lot of time, prayer and study have gone into preparing The 5 Secrets to Social Success with Biblical Principles. I can see application of 5 Secrets in schools, churches and for adults who are learning to transition out from social and economic poverty. The skills your curriculum teaches are the basic building blocks to healthy relationships which build social success in the home and beyond. &lt;/i&gt;	James P. Dumont Senior Pastor Erie Christian Fellowship Church Erie, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This program addresses issues of isolation, thinking errors and attitude and explains Biblical directions for overcoming each issue. Each of these areas is a common pitfall for those trying to re-integrate back into society.  This program has legs!!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Darrell A. Smith  B.S. C.A.C  Director of Programs and Mens Ministries The Erie City Mission Erie, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; I have people tell me all the time that new hires today lack fundamental skills on resolving conflict and respecting the authorities placed over them. The curriculum that Dr. Liken and Mrs. Blalock have written cuts right to the heart of this issue Be blessed, this is truly well done. &lt;/i&gt;  Jason Ackerman, Student Miniistry Pastor Erie Christian Fellowship Church, Erie, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; I have worked in the drug and alcohol field and private counseling, and it is evident that these skills are forgotten during the lifestyle and need to be relearned. The 5 Secrets to Social Success is clearly written and can be utilized both in group format as well as individual  &lt;/i&gt; Charen Pasky, LSW  ABCs of Building Better Lives, LLC  Erie, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In ministry there is a belief that we should not have conflict and that we should turn the other cheek and ignore to no growth and stifles our opportunity to deal with and potentially resolve the conflict (communication) issues. I intend to use your materials immediately with our leadership team to set the stage for more Biblically based communication and conflict resolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Jim Castleberry, PhD  Executive Director The Cornerstone Rescue Mission, Rapid City, South Dakota 57709&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 5 Secrets to Success with Biblical Principles Study Journal reinforces Gods Word in action with everyday life as it applies to each of us...  Also, we cannot draw others to  Christ, if we dont know how to relay the message.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
