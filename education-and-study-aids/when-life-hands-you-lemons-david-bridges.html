  <title>When Life Hands You Lemons … - David Bridges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These kids today  just might change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel like life has handed you lemons? Within the pages of this book you will discover kids who have been handed lemons. Yet, instead of allowing these lemons to make them sour, they have chosen to make the sweetest lemonade you have ever tasted.  If you like a good story, you will love this book.  David Bridges draws you into each and every story as if you were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For eight years David has taught an middle school speech class called Teen Leadership.  During that time, David and his students laughed together and many times cried together.  Most importantly however, they challenged each other to fulfill their destiny. While so many of his students had their innocence stolen from them sat such a young age, they refuse to quit. They will never give up. Excuses will not be found anywhere on the radar of these young heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David currently serves as a leadership consultant for The Flippen Group. He now trains teachers throughout the U. S. how to capture the hearts of the students they serve every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a teacher, parent, youth pastor or community volunteer working with teenagers you will be encouraged and inspired to keep battling for our kids. If you are a teenager, taste the lemonade these kids have made, and maybe make some lemonade of your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David loves teaching and working with educators. Davids wife, Robbin, his two oldest daughters and son-in-law are teachers as well. His youngest daughter is studying Music Education at Baylor University. David  and Robbin currently reside in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
