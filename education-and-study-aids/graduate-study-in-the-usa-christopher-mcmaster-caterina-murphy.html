  <title>Graduate Study in the USA - Christopher McMaster, Caterina Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The premise of this book is simple: if the chapter writers could go back in time and talk with themselves when they began their studies, what advice would they give? Isn’t hindsight a bonus? Each chapter offers this hindsight. The chapters are not personal stories, but useful lessons learned through experience. These lessons are offered to aspiring and current graduate students to help their studies be successful. Chapters contain contributions from a range of academics and academic-practitioners, from those getting established in their careers to those that are more novice and emergent. Contributors include scholars from many universities throughout the United States, and they cover essential aspects of graduate study, such as writing and publishing, relationships with supervisors, utilizing rejection and critique, and becoming a researcher. Contributors write of studying for higher degrees and coping with family, illness, disability, and distance. Culture is bridged between Hispanic scholars and their colleagues in mainstream academia, and international students offer advice to those wanting to study at an American university. This book provides indispensable advice that every graduate student can utilize and follows on from the initial, successful publication of &lt;I&gt;Postgraduate Study in Aotearoa New Zealand: Surviving and Succeeding&lt;/I&gt; (2014). The US edition is part of an international ‘survive and succeed’ series also being produced in Australia, the UK, and South Africa." />
