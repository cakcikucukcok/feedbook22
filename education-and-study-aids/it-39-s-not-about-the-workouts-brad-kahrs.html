  <title>It&#39;s Not About the Workouts - Brad Kahrs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of Coach Kahrs greatest and most lasting gifts to me as a person and as a coach myself was teaching me that before a team can experience winning, each person must buy into the programthe deep belief that what Coach is having us do in the way to win. It is having that faith in what you are doing that breeds success 
 Mark Christner, Mens Head Basketball Coach, Waynesburg University 
&quot;In rare circumstances the magic of team &quot;happens&quot; in human endeavors, and the collective team achievement and surrounding spirit transcends the individual efforts. The art and science of creating this circumstance is a challenging formula to capture. Coach Brad Kahr&#39;s heartfelt book about coaching his team through a very special season succeeds. The lessons and insights that Brad and his team traveled through that special year have relevance not just to building running teams, but to any collection of individuals united on a purpose driven mission with the guidance of a caring, mentoring, and passionate leader.&quot; 
- Keith Brophy, CEO of Sagestone, CEO of Ideomed, former West Michigan Entrepreneur of the Year 
The greatest stories and greatest lessons are those with a heart and soul behind them. The struggles, difficulties, and wonderful moments of Brad Kahrs life are filled with both. The journey of a runner whose life has been filled with commitment to human beings and passion to a heart-breaking sport allows for the most exhilarating, heart-touching, and inspirational stories. 
 Scott Hector, 2001 Michigan Cross Country Coach-of-the-Year &amp; 1988 Cross Country State Champion 
When it comes to getting the most out of an athlete physically, mentally, and emotionally, Coach Brad Kahrs is the best Ive seen. The 2000 and 2001 seasons are the culmination of his efforts in the coaching world. His ability to share all of his heart time and time again and to risk the pain of going for it every day shows his love for his team and is reflected in his writings.
