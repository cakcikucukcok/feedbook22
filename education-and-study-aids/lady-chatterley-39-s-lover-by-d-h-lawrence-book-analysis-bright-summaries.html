  <title>Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover by D. H. Lawrence (Book Analysis) - Bright Summaries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unlock the more straightforward side of &lt;i&gt;Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover&lt;/i&gt; with this concise and insightful summary and analysis!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This engaging summary presents an analysis of &lt;i&gt;Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover&lt;/i&gt; by D. H. Lawrence. As its name suggests, the novel follows the extramarital affair between Lady Constance Chatterley and her husband&#39;s gamekeepers Oliver Mellors. Constance is frustrated by her unsatisfying life with her partially paralysed husband Clifford and gradually grows closer to the seemingly uncouth but ultimately kind and tender Mellors, in spite of the gulf in social class that separates them. The novel&#39;s explicit sexual content and language meant that it was heavily censored when it was first published, and the later release of an unexpurgated edition resulted in an obscenity trial in Britain in 1960. It is arguably D. H. Lawrence&#39;s best-known novel; his other works include &lt;i&gt;Sons and Lovers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Rainbow&lt;/i&gt;, both of which are regularly ranked among the greatest novels of the 20th century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover&lt;/i&gt; in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;oA complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;oCharacter studies&lt;br&gt;oKey themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;oQuestions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you on your reading journey.
