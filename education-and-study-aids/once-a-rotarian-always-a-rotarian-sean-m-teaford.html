  <title>Once a Rotarian, Always a Rotarian - Sean M. Teaford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection was originally written as posts for my blog, Time To Keep It Simple, which has long since served as a daily record of my life as a traveler, writer, genealogist, photographer, Rotarian, Mason, Jew, PR professional, and many other (mostly positive) things. Those original posts have been divided into sections according to The Four Way Test which is recited before every Rotary meeting and serves as a means to guide the actions of every Rotarian. The questions we ask ourselves every day are as follows:
Is it the TRUTH?
Is it FAIR to all concerned?
Does it promote GOOD WILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIP?
Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?
While my activity within Rotary has been limited in recent years, the lessons that I learned while an active member of my club continue to influence my life. The friendships formed during that time are some of my most treasured and I will forever be thankful for the support that I continue to receive from my fellow Rotarians. However, most importantly, my time as a Rotarian has given me the skills and passion for service and community that has made me a better leader, person, husband, and father." />
