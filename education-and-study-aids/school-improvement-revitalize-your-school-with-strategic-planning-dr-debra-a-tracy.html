  <title>School Improvement: Revitalize Your School with Strategic Planning - Dr. Debra A. Tracy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In today&#39;s educational atmosphere of accountability, a results oriented process is necessary to achieve improvement goals.  School Improvement:  Revitalize Your School with Strategic Planning details a practical approach to bringing about positive changes in student achievement.  You already have the tools to do the job.  All you need is the guidance to put the process in motion and the leadership to carry it out.  The strategic planning model detailed in this book involves a six steps process that includes:
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Identifying the purpose, mission, vision, and goals
Collecting and analyzing data
Writing the plan
Implementing the plan
Monitoring and evaluating progress
Revising the plan
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Each phase of the strategic planning process is important, but to achieve the desired improvements, action plans are the crucial element to success.  This process emphasizes the implementation of schoolwide action plans as well as detailed classroom action plans that are routinely monitored.  
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
By setting the stage with collaboration and communication, this process has the power to produce desired results in any school.  This book has been written from the perspective of a building principal for other building principals and school leadership teams who are on the mission of school improvement." />
