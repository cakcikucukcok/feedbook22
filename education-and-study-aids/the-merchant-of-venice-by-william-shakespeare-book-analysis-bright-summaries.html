  <title>The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare (Book Analysis) - Bright Summaries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unlock the more straightforward side of &lt;i&gt;The Merchant of Venice &lt;/i&gt;with this concise and insightful summary and analysis!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This engaging summary presents an analysis of &lt;i&gt;The Merchant of Venice&lt;/i&gt; by William Shakespeare, which recounts the fierce legal battle that ensues when the Jewish moneylender Shylock seeks to claim a &#39;pound of flesh&#39; from the Venetian merchant Antonio, who has defaulted on a loan. The character of Shylock is one of the most controversial in the Shakespearean canon - his cruelty and vengefulness have led many to criticise his characterisation as anti-Semitic, but his portrayal as a victim of prejudice and his eloquent speeches lend ambiguity to that reading, as well as bringing a more tragic dimension to the play as a whole, even though it is often classified as a comedy. &lt;i&gt;The Merchant of Venice&lt;/i&gt; is one of Shakespeare&#39;s most frequently discussed and debated plays even today, and has been consistently adapted for stage and screen since it was first performed in 1600.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;The Merchant of Venice&lt;/i&gt; in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;oA complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;oCharacter studies&lt;br&gt;oKey themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;oQuestions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you on your reading journey.
