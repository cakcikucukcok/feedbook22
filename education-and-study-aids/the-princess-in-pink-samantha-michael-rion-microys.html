  <title>The Princess in Pink - Samantha Michael, Rion Microys</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One day, a girl was severely injured in a car accident that should not have happened. But the driver of the car she was in broke the law. The accident nearly took her life and left her and her family with a deep sadness that they thought might never heal. Until, that is, the girl magically encountered a real-life princess whose gentle grace touched her soul and whose magic pen helped to heal the deepest kind of wound.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In The Princess in Pink, Samantha Michael shares the touching true story of the near-fatal car accident and her long, difficult recovery. With a touch of playful expression, Samantha narrates her emotional tale in language and themes that any child can understand. She shows her young readers that there is still magic in the world. How at any moment, a princess in pink may enter the room and with a warm smile and stroke of a magical pen, she can leave a mark to change your life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
