  <title>Thoughts That Come from Growing Old - Thaddeus J. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author describes the book as being informative, as it
relates to people on any age level. The book deals with 
situations
that happen to people some on a daily basis, and some
not so regular. The book deals with life in general, the quotes
are informative, and can be applied to daily life. The book
was written to arouse the attention of the reader, and to 
perhaps
let the reader pay more attention as to what really goes
on in life daily.&lt;p&gt;
The book gives suggestions on simple day to day lifes problems,
and how you might be able to alleviate some of those
worrisome problems. This book is not a fix all, it merely gives
some simple solutions to some of the problems.&lt;p&gt;
The book as it is titled is uniqueness within itself, because it
covers a variety of topics. The book was designed to hopefully
energize the mind, uplift the spirit, and to make you
the reader pay more attention to life daily around you. The
author definitely believes after a person reads this book, it
just might be the medicine the reader needs to jump start his
or her life.&lt;p&gt;
I am sure many people have heard these quotes before, but
never paid any serious attention to what the quotes conveyed.
It is the intent of this book to arouse the curiosity of
the reader, and to hopefully give the reader a different outlook
on life.&lt;p&gt;
Life is simple when you really understand it.&lt;p&gt;" />
