  <title>Teaching a Child with Special Needs at Home and at School - Judith B. Munday M.A. M.Ed.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you been searching for help as you try to teach a struggling learner? This is the book you have been looking for! Judi Munday draws from what she has learned in 30 years of teaching exceptional students and shares that practical knowledge with you in Teaching a Child with Special Needs at Home and at School: Strategies and Tools that Really Work! This is a highly readable and helpful guide for anyone who teaches a child with learning disabilities or high-functioning autism or Asperger&#39;s. Judi has packed it full of easy-to-use instructional strategies and advice about &quot;&quot;what works&quot; - for both parents who homeschool and for teachers who work with students with special needs. Since it is always difficult to find enough time to individualize, Judi makes sure that her teaching recommendations require little extra work or advance planning. She shows you how easy it is to modify or adapt textbooks and instructional materials. You will also learn about evidence-based instructional tools - such as graphic organizers and rubrics. Chapter topics include high-functioning autism/Asperger&#39;s and specific learning disabilities, along with a generous supply of specific teaching strategies that apply to them. You can also learn more about effective instruction, assistive technology, and student education plans. Judi has the heart to share her wisdom to educate, encourage, and equip you to be a more effective teacher of your special learner.&lt;/p&gt;" />
