  <title>J. Krishnamurti and Educational Practice - Meenakshi Thapan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First in the series on Education and Society in South Asia, this volume focuses on the educational thought of a world-renowned teacher, thinker, and writer—Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895–1986). This edited volume examines Krishnamurti’s work and explores his contemporary relevance in educational endeavours and practices in different parts of the country. The contributors to the volume argue that Krishnamurti sought to change the way education is perceived, from the mere teaching of curriculum into a life-changing experience of learning from relationships and life. Through a range of essays that address diverse issues and themes, the contributors seek to uncover the practices and processes at some of the institutions that Krishnamurti established in different parts of rural and urban India. These include essays on curriculum building, inclusive education, pedagogy, debates on educational philosophy and practice, and teacher education. They help bring out the barriers and breakthroughs in the educational processes as practiced in these schools and how they may further be applied to other educational institutions." />
