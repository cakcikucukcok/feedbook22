  <title>Every Teacher Matters: Inspiring Well-Being through Mindfulness - Kathryn Lovewell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Teachers are the most valuable resource in Education. Why is it that so little investment is made in supporting teachers to ensure they can sustain effective teaching and learning in the classroom? What if we were to invest time and energy back into the core of education, the teachers? What if we were to publicly express how valuable teachers really are? What if we lived in a society that made emotional health and well-being in the workplace a priority? What if we lived in a world where emotional intelligence was prioritised over any other subject so that learning could be accessed more easily and effortlessly? With humour, anecdote, and a wealth of background research, Every Teacher Matters offers a gentle hand to guide teachers - and through them, their students back to their hearts!" />
