  <title>Waking up in College - Dr. David L. Mount</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This powerful book guides us through the tender struggles and silent suffering with an
eye toward fi nding a greater inspiration and hope. Dr. Mount has captured a topic that
requires ongoing conversation and 21st century strategies.
Dr. B.J. Dunn, Founder and CEO of Clinical Enterprises Counseling Center,
Montgomery, AL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Waking Up in College integrates the mind, body, and spirit within the college community.
This beautiful yet practical book provides a holistic dimension to student performance; this
book foundational in reducing higher educational outcomes disparities. Dr. Mount shows
important leadership in working to improve college performance.
Kathy Townsend, Executive Director,
Dorchester Y of The YMCA of Greater Boston&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A brilliant piece of work! The author was able to take an everyday subject and turn it into
a compelling read that I will recommend to all of my students and colleagues.
Professor Michael Canute Lambert, Ph.D., Clinical Psychologist,
School of Social Work at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dr. David L. Mount drives home the importance of building social capital and mobilizing
the energy of feedback. A masterful work full of courage, honesty, and, above all, love.
Invaluable for all of us.
Michael Clements, Vice President,
Community Investment, The Winston-Salem Foundation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a must read. This book provides a perfect balance between discussion and
real examples. Many themes run through the chapters that are organized around the
complexities facing students.
Brian Booton, Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity Program
Coordinator, Offi ce of Undergraduate Research University of Missouri&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book is so accessible that the reader becomes heard, experienced, and championed.
The absorbing chapters are much more than a how to book on coping with college. This
book opens the door to all students by promoting self-evaluation and self-acceptance. The
coaching and tailored academic guidance provided by Dr. Mount has seeded a higher
purpose in me!
