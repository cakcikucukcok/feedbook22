  <title>Patches to the Rescue - Claire LaBelle Rolince, Nancy H. Lindamood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Patches loved being a police horse. Officer Mike came to the stable every day to take care of him and ride him through the city park on their daily route. They would meet families and talk with boys and girls about Officer Mike&#39;s job and Patches. The children always asked about the beautiful heart-shaped patch of hair on Patches&#39; shoulder.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One day, while Patches and Officer Mike were patrolling the park, there was trouble, and the two sprang into action to help a lady.They chased and caught the thief as he tried to escape the mounted police officer.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book shows a positive and friendly relationship between families, especially children and law enforcement. The readers of this book will see how the police are always there to help, serve, and protect us.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;A portion of the proceeds will be donated to C.O.P.S., an organization that benefits the lives of the surviving families of law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
