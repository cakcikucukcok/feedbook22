      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bullies don&amp;rsquo;t discriminate. They are equal opportunity abusers. In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Bullying from streets to schools: Practical information for those who care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, authors Smith and Kearney guide their readers through multiple facets of this growing and pervasive problem. Far beyond other books that simply explore the current research on the topic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Bullying from streets to schools: Practical information for those who care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; shapes the subject of bullying in both understandable and realistic ways. In chapter after chapter, the authors painstakingly direct their readers through numerous &amp;ldquo;peaks and valleys&amp;rdquo; of bullying situations, including the &amp;ldquo;who, what and where&amp;rdquo; of the subject. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Bullying from streets to schools: Practical information for those who care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; features detailed information describing the three critical groups most affected by bullying, including perpetrators, victims and bystanders. The authors accompany their readers through home, school, virtual, and workplace environments, and directly relate how these areas influence the potential development of both bullies and victims. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The realities of bullying hit home as readers also are provided with an intense glimpse into the mind of a bully though an actual interview. Practical suggestions in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Facts, Feelings and Facilitation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; sections at the end of each chapter encourage anti-bullying action by both school and community leaders, and a bullying &amp;ldquo;hotspot&amp;rdquo; map is included along with research-based suggestions for avoiding confrontations. Unlike other books, which deal in part with the issues surrounding bullying, Smith and Kearney engage readers in thoughtful and comprehensive ways that prompt action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
