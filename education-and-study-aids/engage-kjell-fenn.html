  <title>Engage - Kjell Fenn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;The most pressing issue in schools is classroom management, specifically how to motivate students to do the work well. Many teachers need strategies to help them and they also need the theory and research behind the strategies. Why do the strategies work and why do they sometimes not work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book has 5 sections that are the different theoretical foundations for 18 different keys to student motivation. At the beginning of each section, the theory is explained briefly. It is important that the readers understand the reason why a key or strategy works. In this understanding, a teacher can modify and accommodate the key or strategy to fit his/her particular students and context. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are 18 chapters. Each chapter is a key, or applicable concept, to student motivation that has been garnered from a theory or seminal work. This explanation is followed by a vignette of a teacher&amp;rsquo;s experience, called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;In The Classroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and is followed by multiple strategies. &lt;/span&gt;" />
