Did he actually rise from the dead? And was he truly the prophesied savior he claimed to be? Lee Strobel found it all hard to believe, and his doubts led him to ask the tough questions and dig into the real evidence to see if the Bible&#39;s claims and Jesus&#39;s words were true. Inside this book is the scientific data, expert testimonies and interviews, cross-religious comparisons, historical and archeological proofs he discovered during his investigation, and the conclusion he finally came to about Christianity that changed his life forever.
