  <title>Break the Chain of Debt - Yannis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a guide to financial freedom. It includes 8 budgetary forms, eleven rules to follow for success, and instructions on how to use your bank accounts to your advantage. The plan is divided in two sections and you decided which one to use.
 Many people find themselves in debt which occurs for the same reason every time; we dont save money and we spend more than we earn. My struggle with debt led to the creation of this guide. In the book I describe the method I used to pay my debt and to improve my way of living.  The guide consists of instructions for determining the debt load for the household, and the amount of income coming in.  Using forms and examples each individual or family will be able to calculate and control, through a budget, a way to increase debt payoff or to increase savings.  This guide will be a valuable tool for you to use on your way to becoming debt free.  It will allow you to see in black and white how much money you make and how much money you spend or overspend. The budgetary forms will help you to change your future. The knowledge gained will empower you to control your money rather than money controlling you. These forms make you the BOSS of your finances and put you in the driver seat to financial freedom.  Remember that only you have the power to change your future." />
