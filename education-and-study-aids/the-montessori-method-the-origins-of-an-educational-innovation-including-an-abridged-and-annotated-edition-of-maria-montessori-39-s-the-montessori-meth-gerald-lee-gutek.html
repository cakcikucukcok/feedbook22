  <title>The Montessori Method: The Origins of an Educational Innovation: Including an Abridged and Annotated Edition of Maria Montessori&#39;s The Montessori Meth - Gerald Lee Gutek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Montessori Method: The Origins of an Educational Innovation: Including an Abridged and Annotated Edition of Maria Montessori&#39;s The Montessori Method creates the context in which Maria Montessori developed her philosophy of early childhood education. It examines how a determined young woman overcame the obstacles that blocked the educational and career opportunities in Italy during the late Victorian age. Following Montessori, who was the first woman to earn a medical degree from the University of Rome, the biographical introduction takes her story to the establishment of the first Montessori school: the Casa dei Bambini in the slums of Rome. It then analyzes the sources and influences that shaped the creation of the Montessori philosophy of education. Special attention is given to The Montessori Method as the book that introduced this educational innovation to an American audience. The book is divided into four parts: (1) a biography of Maria Montessori: (2) an introductory commentary on the Montessori Method of Education: (3) an abridged and annotated edition of Maria Montessori&#39;s The Montessori Method (1912): (4) related documents." />
