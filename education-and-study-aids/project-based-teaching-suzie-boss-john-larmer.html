  <title>Project Based Teaching - Suzie Boss, John Larmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s no secret that in today&#39;s complex world, students face unparalleled demands as they prepare for college, careers, and active citizenship. However, those demands won&#39;t be met without a fundamental shift from traditional, teacher-centered instruction toward innovative, student-centered teaching and learning. For schools ready to make such a shift, project-based learning (PBL) offers a proven framework to help students be better equipped to tackle future challenges.&lt;p&gt;Project Based Teachers encourage active questioning, curiosity, and peer learning; create learning environments in which every student has a voice; and have a mastery of content but are also comfortable responding to students&#39; questions by saying, &quot;I don’t know. Let&#39;s find out together.&quot;&lt;p&gt;In this book, Suzie Boss and John Larmer build on the framework for Gold Standard PBL originally presented in &lt;em&gt;Setting the Standard for Project Based Learning&lt;/em&gt; and explore the seven practices integral to Project Based Teaching:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build the Culture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design and Plan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Align to Standards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage Activities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assess Student Learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scaffold Student Learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage and Coach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each practice, the authors present a wide range of practical strategies and include teachers&#39; reflections about and suggestions from their classroom experiences.&lt;p&gt;This book and a related series of free videos provide a detailed look at what&#39;s happening in PBL classrooms from the perspective of the Project Based Teacher. Let&#39;s find out together.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copublication of ASCD and Buck Institute for Education (BIE).&lt;/em&gt;" />
