  <title>Bridging The Gap: A Parent&#39;s Guide, 2nd Edition - Terry J Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bridging the Gap: A Parent&amp;rsquo;s Guide proposes an opportunity for parents and educators to work together to help our children gain a better understanding of themselves. The Parent&amp;rsquo;s Guide is the first of a two-part series. The second part is a guide for educators. The book provides information to help adults to look at their behaviors and gain a better understanding of how they are perceived by adults and children. This book is based on simplicity and fun and provides creative activities to enhance your child&amp;rsquo;s self-esteem and socialization skills. It will also provide you with opportunities for quality time to help build and establish communication, trust and rapport. If Bridging The Gap influences one family, child, or educator to change the way they handle specific situations in a more effective and positive manner, then it has served its purpose. It is written in everyday language and is not to be made difficult in any way. That is the foundation for this program and this book, therefore, let&amp;rsquo;s work together toward bridging the gap!&lt;/p&gt;" />
