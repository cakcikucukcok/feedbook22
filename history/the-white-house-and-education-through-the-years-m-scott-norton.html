  <title>The White House and Education through the Years - M. Scott Norton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The book sets forth the early developments established by colonial leaders to place public education in the forefront of their new America. The ups and downs of the educational perspectives of the many national leaders demonstrate the important issues and problems that have faced and are facing the improvement of public education nationally. Although every effort is made to stay clear of the &amp;lsquo;politics&amp;rsquo; that are encountered in educational policy, its influence on educational matters such as control, funding, improvement, purpose and availability is readily recognized in the views and contributions of the nation&amp;rsquo;s presidential leaders. Although the book is not a history of a president&amp;rsquo;s life or a history of a president&amp;rsquo;s personal education, many books have been written on these topics, this book focuses on the educational views and personal contributions of the presidents to the maintenance and improvement of K-12 and higher education in America from the colonial period to the present time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
