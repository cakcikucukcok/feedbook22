  <title>TR&#39;s Last War - David Pietrusza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A riveting new account of Theodore Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s impassioned crusade for military preparedness as America fitfully stumbles into World War I, spectacularly punctuated by his unique tongue-lashings of the vacillating Woodrow Wilson, his rousing advocacy of a masculine, pro-Allied &amp;ldquo;Americanism,&amp;rdquo; a death-defying compulsion for personal front-line combat, a gingerly rapprochement with GOP power brokers&amp;mdash;and, yes, perhaps, even another presidential campaign. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roosevelt is a towering Greek god of war. But Greek gods begat Greek tragedies. His own entreaties to don the uniform are rebuffed, and he remains stateside. But his four sons fight &amp;ldquo;over there&amp;rdquo; with heartbreaking consequences: two are wounded; his youngest and most loved child dies in aerial combat. Yet, though grieving and weary, TR may yet surmount everything with one monumentally odds-defying last triumph. Poised at the very brink of a final return to the White House, death stills his indomitable spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his lively, witty, blow-by-blow style, David Pietrusza captures, through the lens of the Bull Moose, the 1916 presidential campaign, America&amp;rsquo;s entry into the Great War in 1917, Woodrow Wilson&amp;rsquo;s presidency, and the last years of one of American history&amp;rsquo;s greatest men, who said on his death bed at the age of sixty, &amp;ldquo;I promised myself that I would work &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;up to the hilt &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;until I was sixty, and I have done it. I have kept my promise&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; Pietrusza not only transports readers with his dramatic portraits of TR, his hated rival Wilson, and politics in wild flux but also poignantly chronicles the horrific price a family pays in war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
