  <title>A History of US: All the People: Since 1945 A History of US Book Ten - Joy Hakim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recommended by the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy as an exemplary informational text.  A History of US is a 10-volume, award-winning series about the birth and development of the United States as related by master storyteller Joy Hakim. All the People, the last volume in the series, covers US History from the end of World War II to the present. This updated fourth edition covers, for the first time, events that have taken place in the past 6 years, including the 2008 election of Barack Obama and the signficance of this election. All the People focuses on Civil Rights in the last half of the 20th Century and the beginning of the 21st, ensuring that readers will have a firm grasp of the groundbreaking nature and lasting importance of this movement.  Throughout the book, which has been completely redesigned with a bold new look, Hakim portrays contemporary American life in a lively, engaging way. Readers will encounter fascinating stories about famous Americans (Joe McCarthy, Martin Luther King, Jr., Richard Nixon), historical events (the Vietnam War, the first man on the moon), and major cultural movements (1960s counterculture, feminism). Interspersed features provide further anecdotes about the characters that have shaped the last 65 years--for instance, one conjectures about what Alan Greenspan might hide in his briefcase; another discusses the life and times of Mark I, the worlds first automatic computer. Sidebars, illustrations, definitions and quotes line the margins, providing illimitable sources of information and entertainment.  About the Series: Master storyteller Joy Hakim has excited millions of young minds with the great drama of American history in her award-winning series A History of US. Recommended by the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy as an exemplary informational text, A History of US weaves together exciting stories that bring American history to life. Hailed by reviewers, historians, educators, and parents for its exciting, thought-provoking narrative, the books have been recognized as a break-through tool in teaching history and critical reading skills to young people. In ten books that span from Prehistory to the 21st century, young people will never think of American history as boring again." />
