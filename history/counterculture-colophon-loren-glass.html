  <title>Counterculture Colophon - Loren Glass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Responsible for such landmark publications as &lt;I&gt;Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Tropic of Cancer&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Naked Lunch&lt;/I&gt;, Waiting for Godot&lt;/I&gt;,&lt;I&gt;The Wretched of the Earth &lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&lt;/I&gt;, Grove Press was the most innovative publisher of the postwar era. &lt;I&gt;Counterculture Colophon&lt;/I&gt; tells the story of how the press and its house journal, &lt;I&gt;The Evergreen Review&lt;/I&gt;, revolutionized the publishing industry and radicalized the reading habits of the &quot;paperback generation.&quot; In the process, it offers a new window onto the 1960s, from 1951, when Barney Rosset purchased the fledgling press for $3,000, to 1970, when the multimedia corporation into which he had built the company was crippled by a strike and feminist takeover.
Grove Press was not only responsible for ending censorship of the printed word in the United States but also for bringing avant-garde literature, especially drama, into the cultural mainstream as part of the quality paperback revolution. Much of this happened thanks to Rosset, whose charismatic leadership was crucial to Grove&#39;s success. With chapters covering world literature and the Latin American boom, including Grove&#39;s close association with UNESCO and the rise of cultural diplomacy; experimental drama such as the theater of the absurd, the Living Theater, and the political epics of Bertolt Brecht; pornography and obscenity, including the landmark publication of the complete work of the Marquis de Sade; revolutionary writing, featuring Rosset&#39;s daring pursuit of the Bolivian journals of Che Guevara; and underground film, including the innovative development of the pocket filmscript, Loren Glass covers the full spectrum of Grove&#39;s remarkable achievement as a communications center of the counterculture." />
