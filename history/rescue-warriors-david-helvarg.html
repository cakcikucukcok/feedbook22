  <title>Rescue Warriors - David Helvarg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since its founding more than two hundred years ago, the United States Coast Guard has rescued over a million people. On any given day, &quot;Coasties&quot; respond to 125 distress calls and save over a dozen lives. Yet despite having more than 50,000 active-duty and reserve members on every ocean and on our nation&#39;s coasts, great lakes, and rivers, most of us know very little about this often neglected but crucial branch of the military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Rescue Warriors&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning journalist David Helvarg brings us into the daily lives of Coasties, filled with a salty maritime mix of altruism and adrenaline, as well as dozens of death-defying rescues at sea and on hurricane-ravaged shores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helvarg spent two years with the men and women of the Coast Guard, from the halls of their academy in New London, Connecticut, to the frigid, storm-tossed waters of Alaska&#39;s Bering Sea, to the northern Persian Gulf, where they currently guard Iraqi oil terminals. The result is a masterpiece of adventure reporting---the definitive book on America&#39;s &quot;forgotten heroes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
