  <title>DANIK! A Holocaust Survivor - The True Story of David Kalma (David Zaid) - Ross R. Olney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Zaid survived the extermination of Jews in Poland ordered by Adolph Hitler and went on to become a hero in the Israeli army. His voice is now stilled, but with this book he continues to speak out against the holocaust-deniers who insist that the atrocities never happened. Zaid lived through it, and knows the truth. And if he ever questioned his own courage while hiding from the murderous Nazis and equally murderous Polish farmers in a Polish forest, the questions were answered in the Israeli wars as he fought in hand to hand combat for his beloved new homeland. He survived once again, and saw his final dream come true when he, along with his wife and two sons, became American citizens." />
