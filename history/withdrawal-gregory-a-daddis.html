  <title>Withdrawal - Gregory A. Daddis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A &quot;better war.&quot; Over the last two decades, this term has become synonymous with US strategy during the Vietnam War&#39;s final years. The narrative is enticingly simple, appealing to many audiences. After the disastrous results of the 1968 Tet offensive, in which Hanoi&#39;s forces demonstrated the failures of American strategy, popular history tells of a new American military commander who emerged in South Vietnam and with inspired leadership and a new approach turned around a long stalemated conflict. In fact, so successful was General Creighton Abrams in commanding US forces that, according to the &quot;better war&quot; myth, the United States had actually achieved victory by mid-1970. A new general with a new strategy had delivered, only to see his victory abandoned by weak-kneed politicians in Washington, DC who turned their backs on the US armed forces and their South Vietnamese allies.
In a bold new interpretation of America&#39;s final years in Vietnam, acclaimed historian Gregory A. Daddis disproves these longstanding myths. &lt;em&gt;Withdrawal&lt;/em&gt; is a groundbreaking reassessment that tells a far different story of the Vietnam War. Daddis convincingly argues that the entire US effort in South Vietnam was incapable of reversing the downward trends of a complicated Vietnamese conflict that by 1968 had turned into a political-military stalemate. Despite a new articulation of strategy, Abrams&#39;s approach could not materially alter a war no longer vital to US national security or global dominance. Once the Nixon White House made the political decision to withdraw from Southeast Asia, Abrams&#39;s military strategy was unable to change either the course or outcome of a decades&#39; long Vietnamese civil war.
In a riveting sequel to his celebrated &lt;em&gt;Westmoreland&#39;s War&lt;/em&gt;, Daddis demonstrates he is one of the nation&#39;s leading scholars on the Vietnam War.&lt;em&gt; Withdrawal&lt;/em&gt; will be a standard work for years to come." />
