  <title>Sex in Old New Orleans: Three Book Set - Emily Epstein Landau, Alecia P. Long, Judith Kelleher Schafer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="*** EBOOK EXCLUSIVE ***  BOOK 1: Spectacular Wickedness  From 1897 to 1917 the red-light district of Storyville commercialized and even thrived on New Orleans&#39;s longstanding reputation for sin and sexual excess. This notorious neighborhood, located just outside of the French Quarter, hosted a diverse cast of characters who reflected the cultural milieu and complex social structure of turn-of-the-century New Orleans, a city infamous for both prostitution and interracial intimacy.  BOOK 2: The Great Southern Babylon  With a well-earned reputation for tolerance of both prostitution and miscegenation, New Orleans became known as the Great Southern Babylon in antebellum times. Following the Civil War, a profound alteration in social and economic conditions gradually reshaped the city&#39;s sexual culture and erotic commerce. Historian Alecia P. Long traces sex in the Crescent City over fifty years, drawing from Louisiana Supreme Court case testimony to relate intriguing tales of people both obscure and famous whose relationships and actions exemplify the era.  BOOK 3: Brothels, Depravity, and Abandoned Women  When a priest suggested to one of the first governors of Louisiana that he banish all disreputable women to raise the colony&#39;s moral tone, the governor responded, &quot;If I send away all the loose females, there will be no women left here at all.&quot; Primitive, mosquito infested, and disease ridden, early French colonial New Orleans offered few attractions to entice respectable women as residents. King Louis XIV of France solved the population problem in 1721 by emptying Paris&#39;s La Salpêtrière prison of many of its most notorious prostitutes and convicts and sending them to Louisiana. Many of these women continued to ply their trade in New Orleans." />
