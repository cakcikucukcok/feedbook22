Starr Senior Fellow and Director for Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations:  &lt;/b&gt;&quot;An engaging read for anyone looking for an introduction to contemporary Chinese culture and society.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author, in his twenties, who is fluent in Chinese, examines the future of China through the lens of the Jiu Ling Hou--the generation born after 1990.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A close up look at the Chinese generation born after 1990 exploring through personal encounters how young Chinese feel about everything from money and sex, to their government, the West, and China&#39;s shifting role in the world--not to mention their love affair with food, karaoke, and travel. Set primarily in the Eastern 2nd tier city of Suzhou and the budding Western metropolis of Chengdu, the book charts the touchstone issues this young generation faces. From single-child pressure, to test taking madness and the frenzy to buy an apartment as a prerequisite to marriage, from one-night-stands to an evolving understanding of family, &lt;i&gt;Young China&lt;/i&gt; offers a fascinating portrait of the generation who will define what it means to be Chinese in the modern era. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zak Dychtwald was twenty when he first landed in China. He spent years deeply immersed in the culture, learning the language and hanging out with his peers, in apartment shares and hostels, on long train rides and over endless restaurant meals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
