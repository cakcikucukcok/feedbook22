  <title>Not White Enough, Not Black Enough: Racial Identity in the South African Coloured Community - Mohamed Adhikari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The concept of Colouredness-being neither white nor black-has been pivotal to the brand of racial thinking particular to South African society. The nature of Coloured identity and its heritage of oppression has always been a matter of intense political and ideological contestation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not White Enough, Not Black Enough: Racial Identity in the South African Coloured Community&lt;/em&gt; is the first systematic study of Coloured identity, its history, and its relevance to South African national life. Mohamed Adhikari engages with the debates and controversies thrown up by the identity&#39;s troubled existence and challenges much of the conventional wisdom associated with it. A combination of wide-ranging thematic analyses and detailed case studies illustrates how Colouredness functioned as a social identity from the time of its emergence in the late nineteenth century through its adaptation to the postapartheid environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adhikari demonstrates how the interplay of marginality, racial hierarchy, assimilationist aspirations, negative racial stereotyping, class divisions, and ideological conflicts helped mold people&#39;s sense of Colouredness over the past century. Knowledge of this history, and of the social and political dynamic that informed the articulation of a separate Coloured identity, is vital to an understanding of present-day complexities in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;" />
