  <title>Poems from the Great War - 17 Poems donated by notable poets for National Relief during WWI - Various</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection of 17 Poems from the Great War represented the free offering of English poets to the cause of National Relief during WWI.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of these poems appeared in the Press at the outbreak of WWI. Mr. Robert Bridges&amp;#39; (Poet Laureate 1913 &amp;ndash; 1930) opening contribution, Mr. Henry Newbolt&amp;#39;s, Mr. Maurice Hewlett&amp;#39;s, Mr. R. E. Vern&amp;egrave;de&amp;#39;s, Mr. Binyon&amp;#39;s, were all printed in the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; during the few days immediately following the declaration of war, as also was the sonnet by Mr. William Watson. Sir Owen Seaman&amp;#39;s poem came out originally in &lt;i&gt;Punch&lt;/i&gt;, &amp;quot;The Hour&amp;quot; in the &lt;i&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;, &amp;quot;The United Front&amp;quot; in the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;quot;We Willed it Not&amp;quot; is reprinted from the &lt;i&gt;Sphere&lt;/i&gt;, &amp;quot;Duty&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Commandeered&amp;quot; from the &lt;i&gt;Westminster Gazette&lt;/i&gt;, and the poems by Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Cecil Chesterton from the &lt;i&gt;New Witness&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;New Weekly&lt;/i&gt; published the verses by Mr. John Freeman, and the &lt;i&gt;Daily Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; those by Mr. Harold Begbie. The two hymns which close the collection are reprinted, by special permission of their authors, from volumes previously published.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The original cover design, from which the current was developed, was contributed by Mr. William Nicholson (1872 &amp;ndash; 1949).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the National Relief program was wound up in about 1923, the 33% of the net profit from the sale of this book will be donated to the Royal British Legion for their continued work with Returned Servicemen." />
