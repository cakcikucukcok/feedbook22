  <title>Skelligside - Michael Kirby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This is the remarkable folk autobiography of a small famer, fisherman and poet from from the South Iveragh peninsula of Co. Kerry, part of Ireland&#39;s western sea-board, a region bounded by mountains and unique inits cultural inheritance. Kirby&#39;s writing combines description with narrative, anecdote and poetry, and gives a vivid pen-picture of the locality of Ballinskelligs - its famed island and birds, its fishing, husbandry, crafts, old customes, migrant experience, local history and folklore - in testimony to a vanishing way of life. Kirby&#39;s voice - akin to that of the Blasket writers - is one of the last authentic expressions of a Gaelic tradition, imaginatively fusing worlds of flesh and spirit. He writesd with all the artlessness and freshness of a man departing from his native language. By gathering one small area into the net of memory, personal and inherited, Michael Kirby celebrates and commemorates the place where he was born. &quot;He loves the lore and traditions of his people, which he expresses with passion and conviction.&quot; Ronan Sheehan, Irish Press. &quot;A beautifully written evocation of Kerry ... This is a gem of a book, a gentle folk autobiography which undulates in the lyrical idioms of the author&#39;s native language ... It glows with warmth and celebration for a lost heritage ... it resonates in the mind like the purest music.&quot; Aodhan Madden, Sunday Press&lt;/div&gt;" />
