  <title>Does Christianity Really Need Jesus? - J. Clifton Briscoe, J. D. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is all this talk of blood, sacrifices, death, and mutilation really necessary? Perhaps all these primitive, barbaric ways of man trying to deal with his predicament is just thatprimitive and barbaric. Furthermore, is man in a real dilemma or is it a fabricated tale of deluded individuals we deem as prophets? 
     Clifton Briscoe tackles this question head on in an expose that gives answers on how we got into  this situation and what the answer had to be. This treatise is not preachy. It tells a story. It is a story of people grappling with age -old questions and finding real, meaningful answers. Their stories are links that chronicle a history with an inevitable conclusion. The finale is both wildly dramatic and full of revelation and common sense. It had to be.
     In Part II, Briscoe shows that the ramifications of these spectacular events of two thousand years ago have not been abated. Actually, there is a groundswell in the reaction to this bloody scene! It can never be stopped!" />
