  <title>The Devil&#39;s Diary - Robert K. Wittman, David Kinney</title>

By the dawn of the Third Reich, he had published a bestselling masterwork that was a touchstone of Nazi thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His diary was discovered hidden in a Bavarian castle at war&amp;#8217;s end&amp;#8212;five hundred pages providing a harrowing glimpse into the mind of a man whose ideas set the stage for the Holocaust.

The phone call sparked a decade-long hunt that took them on a twisting path involving a pair of octogenarian secretaries, an eccentric professor, and an opportunistic trash-picker.
