  <title>Festival of Christmas - Laurence Whistler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;For children the day begins with a weight on the toes, long, angular, and many-faceted as a leg by Picasso. The stocking should be opened by candlelight: no other light is resonant at that high frequency of excitement.&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;Christmas is one of the oldest of our traditions, more ancient than any present-day beliefs, and strong enough to have survived even the attacks of Puritans in the seventeenth century.&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;Shortly after the end of World War II, Laurence Whistler set out to write “a guide to the festivals of England as they are and as they might be”: Christmas and its associated holidays formed one of the principal parts of his captivating narrative.&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;Here, for example, is the radiant Kissing Bough, whose candles we lit before we had ever heard of a Christmas Tree. Here is the history of carols, Christmas Cards, and the tradition of ‘first footing’ on New Year’s Day. The chapters, written with the imaginative delight of a poet, explore the traditions of Christmas in England since its earliest times, ranging from Christmas Eve to Twelfth Night.&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;This short work, which also contains beautiful illustrations by Robin Jaques and Joan Hassall, is a charming companion to anyone interested in the magic and tradition inherent in the Christmas Season.&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;“A lovely benevolence; the author’s knowledge, his sense of values, his breadth of outlook are in evidence on every page.” &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;John O’London’s Weekly&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;“Possessing enchantment of matter, it has also enchantment of manner.” &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;Time and Tide&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;" />
