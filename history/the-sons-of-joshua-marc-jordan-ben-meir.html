  <title>The Sons of Joshua - Marc Jordan Ben-Meir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And Moses passed to the ages and the mantle of leadership fell to Joshua&lt;/em&gt;. Joshua, the Jewish general, led the Israelites to victory after victory. Eventually, they too were scattered to the four corners of the earth. It wasnt until the American Civil War that the Jews left the north in droves to fight for the Confederacy. Not because they believed in slavery, but the anti-Semitism they had experienced in the north would not allow them to live as equal citizens. In the South, after a two-thousand year exile the Jews once again fought as a people for freedom and equality. Read about the four Jews in Jefferson Davis cabinet. Read about the Jewish military leaders and soldiers. Read about those, the remnant of the ones murdered, burned at the stake, forced to convert, and how they came into their own in the antebellum South.&lt;/p&gt;" />
