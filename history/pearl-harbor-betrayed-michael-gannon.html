  <title>Pearl Harbor Betrayed - Michael Gannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A naval historian draws on newly revealed primary documents to shed light on the tragic errors that led to the devastating attack, Washington&#39;s role, and the man who took the fall for the Japanese tactical victory.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Gannon begins his authoritative account of the &quot;impossible to forget&quot; attack with the essential background story of Japan&#39;s imperialist mission and the United States&#39; uncertain responses--especially two lost chances of delaying the inevitable attack until the military was prepared to defend Pearl Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gannon disproves two Pearl Harbor legends: first, that there was a conspiracy to withhold intelligence from the Pacific Commander in order to force a Pacific war, and second, that Admiral Kimmel was informed but failed to act. Instead, Gannon points to two critical factors ignored by others: that information about the attack gleaned from the &quot;Magic&quot; code intercepts was not sent to Admiral Kimmel, and that there was no possibility that Kimmel could have defended Pearl Harbor because the Japanese were militarily far superior to the American forces in December of 1941.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gannon has divided the story into three parts: the background, eyewitness accounts of the stunning Japanese tactical victory, and the aftermath, which focuses on the Commander, who was blamed for the biggest military disaster in American history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pearl Harbor Betrayed &lt;/i&gt;sheds new light on a crucial and infamous moment in history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
