  <title>The Battle of Ezra Church and the Struggle for Atlanta - Earl J. Hess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fought on July 28, 1864, the Battle of Ezra Church was a dramatic engagement during the Civil War&#39;s Atlanta Campaign. Confederate forces under John Bell Hood desperately fought to stop William T. Sherman&#39;s advancing armies as they tried to cut the last Confederate supply line into the city. Confederates under General Stephen D. Lee nearly overwhelmed the Union right flank, but Federals under General Oliver O. Howard decisively repelled every attack. After five hours of struggle, 5,000 Confederates lay dead and wounded, while only 632 Federals were lost. The result was another major step in Sherman&#39;s long effort to take Atlanta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hess&#39;s compelling study is the first book-length account of the fighting at Ezra Church. Detailing Lee&#39;s tactical missteps and Howard&#39;s vigilant leadership, he challenges many common misconceptions about the battle. Richly narrated and drawn from an array of unpublished manuscripts and firsthand accounts, Hess&#39;s work sheds new light on the complexities and significance of this important engagement, both on and off the battlefield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
