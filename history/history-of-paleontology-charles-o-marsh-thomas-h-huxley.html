  <title>History of Paleontology - Charles O. Marsh, Thomas H. Huxley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;What  is life? This question gives a new interest to every department of  science that relates to life in any form, and the history of life offers  a most suggestive field for research. The paleontology took its origin  in the mind of the first person who, finding something like a shell or a  bone naturally imbedded in gravel or in rock, indulged in speculations  upon the nature of this thing which he had dug out—this &quot;fossil&quot;—and  upon the causes which had brought it into such a position. In this  rudimentary form, a high antiquity may safely be ascribed to  paleontology, inasmuch as we know that, five hundred years before the  Christian era, the philosophic doctrines of Xenophanes were influenced  by his observations upon the fossil remains exposed in the quarries of  Syracuse. From this time forth, not only the philosophers, but the  poets, the historians, the geographers of antiquity occasionally refer  to fossils; and after the revival of learning lively controversies arose  respecting their real nature.&lt;/span&gt;
