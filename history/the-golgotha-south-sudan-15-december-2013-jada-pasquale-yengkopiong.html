  <title>The Golgotha: South Sudan 15 December 2013 - Jada Pasquale Yengkopiong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Golgotha is the most up-to-date book written with the tone of bare truth that most people do not know. The book reveals the intentions and the effects of the SPLA/M Dinka-dominated tribal regime in South Sudan. This tribal leadership is different from all forms of leaderships that are known today. This tribal leadership is completely based on what Salva Kiir Mayardit and his godfathers, the Jieng (Dinka) Council of Elders think is right for South Sudan. In the SPLA/M Dinka-dominated tribal regime, the leader is surrounded by his tribesmen and everything is based on the tribal doctrine. As a result, South Sudan is no longer governed as a country but a tribal village. This tribal leadership caused the 15 December 2013 killing of the Nuer people in Juba and other parts of the country.
The book also reveals that the SPLA/M tribal leadership has aided its tribesmen with the necessary machinery to kill people from the other tribes. Most of these tribal killings have headed to rape of women and young girls, torture and looting of innocent people. Because of this tribal leadership, there is no more freedom in South Sudan. Because of this tribal leadership and the need for tribal domination, the people of South Sudan have been driven onto a crossroad of narcissism and tribalism. There is no more liberty or security for everyone but tribal despotism, fear, and mistrust." />
