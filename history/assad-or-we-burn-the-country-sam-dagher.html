  <title>Assad or We Burn the Country - Sam Dagher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From a Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist specializing in the Middle East, this groundbreaking account of the Syrian Civil War reveals the never-before-published true story of a 21st-century humanitarian disaster.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In spring 2011, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad turned to his friend and army commander, Manaf Tlass, for advice about how to respond to Arab Spring-inspired protests. Tlass pushed for conciliation but Assad decided to crush the uprising -- an act which would catapult the country into an eight-year long war, killing almost half a million and fueling terrorism and a global refugee crisis. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Assad or We Burn the Country&lt;/i&gt; examines Syria&#39;s tragedy through the generational saga of the Assad and Tlass families, once deeply intertwined and now estranged in Bashar&#39;s bloody quest to preserve his father&#39;s inheritance. By drawing on his own reporting experience in Damascus and exclusive interviews with Tlass, Dagher takes readers within palace walls to reveal the family behind the destruction of a country and the chaos of an entire region. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dagher shows how one of the world&#39;s most vicious police states came to be and explains how a regional conflict extended globally, engulfing the Middle East and pitting the United States and Russia against one another. Timely, propulsive, and expertly reported, &lt;i&gt;Assad or We Burn the Country&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive account of this global crisis, going far beyond the news story that has dominated headlines for years." />
