  <title>Real life in Castro&#39;s Cuba - Catherine Moses</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This new book provides a first-hand, grassroots look at life in Cuba, including very vivid descriptions of its people and places. Real Life in Castro&#39;s Cuba illuminates the human face of Cuba, which over the years has largely been hidden in the shadow of Fidel Castro.&lt;p&gt; Real Life in Castro&#39;s Cuba is written by Catherine Moses, who lived and worked in Cuba as a press secretary and spokesperson for the United States from 1995 to 1996. This compelling, compassionate portrait contains personal observations about the Cubans&#39; struggles, triumphs, hopes, and daily compromises to survive. The Cuban population lives with a deteriorating infrastructure, forcing many hardships on the people, including a scarcity of food, fuel, clothing, medicines, and other basic needs.&lt;p&gt; The author&#39;s detailed cultural account of Cuba introduces the reader to everyday Cubans from party officials to dissidents to everyone in between. It shows how Cuba&#39;s socialist system works and gives reasons why Fidel Castro is still in power. Real Life in Castro&#39;s Cuba also describes the significant role of religion and spirituality in the life of Cubans. Although Moses expresses regret over the state of U.S.-Cuban relations, the purpose of the book is not to choose up sides. Instead, the book is designed simply to introduce readers to real life in Cuba.&lt;p&gt; The book&#39;s unique approach allows an intimate picture of life in a faded Marxist regime. As the author writes, &#39;Cuba is a curious mixture of Spanish Caribbean, socialist ideals gone awry, memories of what was, and a desperate need to survive.&#39;&lt;p&gt; This fascinating new book will appeal to all readers who are interested in getting a closer look at what life is like in Cuba today.&lt;p&gt;" />
