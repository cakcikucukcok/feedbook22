  <title>The Occupation of Germany, 1945–1949 - C. Kent Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about World War II, the reign of Adolph Hitler, and the persecution and annihilation of the Jewish people. But what happened in Germany after the war? In &lt;i&gt;The Occupation of Germany, 19451949&lt;/i&gt;, author C. Kent Palmer provides a firsthand account of the duties of the US troops in Germany following the conclusion of the war. The task was to keep Germany safe and secure and to assist in the rebuilding process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmer, who served with the US Army Military Police, describes Germany at that time as the Wild West of America. He explains the environment in which the young soldiers operated, presents some of the threats and dangers with which they were presented, and discusses some of the unique situations that occurred including stories about off-duty freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part history, part memoir, &lt;i&gt;The Occupation of Germany, 19451949&lt;/i&gt; offers the firsthand viewpoint of one young American solider who served his country while helping another country to restructure after being defeated in a terrible war.&lt;/p&gt;" />
