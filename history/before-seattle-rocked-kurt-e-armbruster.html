  <title>Before Seattle Rocked - Kurt E. Armbruster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Seattle is a music town with rich, deep roots that have influenced the culture and identity of its civic life for decades. In a society that appreciates music but is ambivalent toward the profession of making it, the importance and contribution of Seattle&#39;s musicians have been routinely overlooked in historical accounts of the city. Kurt Armbruster fills that gap in this far-reaching and entertaining panorama of Seattle music from the 1890s to the 1960s, &quot;before Seattle rocked.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For this once-remote city, music forged links as real as those created by railroads and steamships. Classical music embodied the middle-class aspirations for gentility and cosmopolitan stature; jazz and blues gave Seattle&#39;s small African American community a vehicle for affirmation and economic advancement; ethnic music helped immigrants adjust to a new home; songs and drumming kept the memories of the Duwamish alive in a changing world. Before Seattle Rocked is enlivened by personal anecdotes and memories from many of Seattle&#39;s most beloved musicians and is enriched by historic photos of the changing music scene.&lt;/P&gt;" />
