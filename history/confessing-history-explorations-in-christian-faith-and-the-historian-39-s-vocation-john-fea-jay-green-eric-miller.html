  <title>Confessing History: Explorations in Christian Faith and the Historian&#39;s Vocation - John Fea, Jay Green, Eric Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the end of his landmark 1994 book, The Soul of the American University, historian George Marsden asserted that religious faith does indeed have a place in today&#39;s academia. Marsden&#39;s contention sparked a heated debate on the role of religious faith and intellectual scholarship in academic journals and in the mainstream media. The contributors to Confessing History: Explorations in Christian Faith and the Historian&#39;s Vocation expand the discussion about religion&#39;s role in education and culture and examine what the relationship between faith and learning means for the academy today. The contributors to Confessing History ask how the vocation of historian affects those who are also followers of Christ. What implications do Christian faith and practice have for living out one&#39;s calling as an historian? And to what extent does one&#39;s calling as a Christian disciple speak to the nature, quality, or goals of one&#39;s work as scholar, teacher, adviser, writer, community member, or social commentator? Written from several different theological and professional points of view, the essays collected in this volume explore the vocation of the historian and its place in both the personal and professional lives of Christian disciples." />
