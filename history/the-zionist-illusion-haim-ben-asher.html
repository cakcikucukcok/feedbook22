  <title>The Zionist Illusion - Haim Ben-Asher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;What is the use of Zionism?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To restore our pride as Jews, comes the ready answer. Now 
just when
did we lose this precious pride? Could it be that, without the 
State
of Israel, Zionists might be ashamed of being Jews? And how 
can
one be proud of a country that drops white phosphorous bombs 
on
defenseless civilians?&lt;p&gt;
Instead of combating anti-Semitism, Zionism cultivates it. An
essential dogma of this new creed is that anti-Semitism is 
immutable
and permanent. Zionists claim that we are still in 1938, and that 
a
new Holocaust is in the offi ng. Every passing year becomes a 
year
of broken glass. So we must rally around the State of Israel, 
which
alone can save us. A fear-based religion allows Jewish leaders in 
the
Diaspora to retain power over their flock.&lt;p&gt;
To free themselves from such blackmail, to break out of the 
vicious
Auschwitz-Israel circle, Jews have only to disconnect from 
Zionism
and take up their historic vocation: explaining Torah to the 
nations.
But first, they will have to understand it themselves.&lt;p&gt;
Haim Ben-Asher is a historian.&lt;p&gt;" />
