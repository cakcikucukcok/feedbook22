  <title>Gettysburg--The First Day - Harry W. Pfanz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For good reason, the second and third days of the Battle of Gettysburg have received the lion&#39;s share of attention from historians. With this book, however, the critical first day&#39;s fighting finally receives its due. After sketching the background of the Gettysburg campaign and recounting the events immediately preceding the battle, Harry Pfanz offers a detailed tactical description of events of the first day. He describes the engagements in McPherson Woods, at the Railroad Cuts, on Oak Ridge, on Seminary Ridge, and at Blocher&#39;s Knoll, as well as the retreat of Union forces through Gettysburg and the Federal rally on Cemetery Hill. Throughout, he draws on deep research in published and archival sources to challenge many long-held assumptions about the battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
