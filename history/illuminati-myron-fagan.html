  <title>Illuminati - Myron Fagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1967, Myron Fagan released a three-LP set titled Illuminati. This recording has been transcribed (you can hear the original audio here) and the text has been used to create this edition, published in 2017 by A Distant Mirror in paperback, Kindle and epub formats.  Myron Fagan reveals the plot for global enslavement launched two centuries ago by Adam Weishaupt when he created the organisation which he named the &#39;Illuminati&#39;. Fagan describes how this group has been used by the House of Rothschild to work towards a world government, and how every war during the past two centuries has been instigated by them.  This is the fascinating, horrifying - and factual - story of the most sensational plot in the history of the world. Fagan lays out the history of the Illuminati, exposing the plot for a single world government. The author gives names, dates, organizations, modes of operations - all exposing the Satanic octopus that to this day seeks to strangle the world in its grip." />
