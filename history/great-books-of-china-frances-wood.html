  <title>Great Books of China - Frances Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Great Books of China&lt;/I&gt; invites readers to discover—or rediscover—some of the major achievements of Chinese culture and civilization. The literature of China remains largely unknown in the West, yet it offers much insight into Chinese life. The long continuity of Chinese culture means that texts created more than two thousand years ago are still part of the education and background of today&#39;s China. &lt;I&gt;Great Books of China&lt;/I&gt; introduces outstanding works of various genres, from fiction, drama, and poetry to history, science, and travel; they were written by philosophers and artists, government officials and scholars, by men and women across many centuries and from every part of China. These great books are presented in their historic, cultural, and social context, with a focused summary of content and author.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Beginning with some of the Confucian and Daoist classics and ending with modern fiction, &lt;i&gt;Great Books of China&lt;/i&gt; features famous novels including &lt;i&gt;The Water Margin&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Shuihu zhuan&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Xiyou ji&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;Dream of the Red Chamber&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Hongloumeng&lt;/i&gt;); celebrated dramas such as &lt;i&gt;The Story of the Lute&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pipa ji&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;The Peach Blossom Fan&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Taohua shan&lt;/i&gt;); poetry from ancient times and the “golden age” of the Tang to the last years of imperial China; renowned historic manuals on Chinese painting, on the construction of Chinese gardens, and on a carpenter’s varied tasks; major texts describing Chinese history, the military exploits of ancient generals, and the legendary journeys of Buddhist monks; and works by a number of modern writers including Lu Xun, Ding Ling, and Lao She.&lt;br&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Concise, provocative, and illuminating, &lt;I&gt;Great Books of China&lt;/I&gt; introduces the literature of one of the world&#39;s most significant cultures and helps us understand the China of the present and the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
