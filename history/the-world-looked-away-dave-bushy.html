  <title>The World Looked Away - Dave Bushy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What happened to the people who remained in the former South Vietnam after the war ended in April 1975? Few of us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war-weary United States had turned its attention away from the region, and the Communist leadership closed Vietnam to Western journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, little was heard, but retribution against the South Vietnamese was swift and unending. Hundreds of thousands of former South Vietnamese military officers were sent to Reeducation Camps. Expecting a confinement of just ten days, most were incarcerated for years, suffering brutality, starvation and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The families of prisoners had property and savings confiscated. They were denied jobs and medical care. They lived in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, nearly a million Boat People chose to escape Vietnam by sea, taking their chances in fragile overcrowded vessels. Thousands died at the hands of pirates and the unforgiving ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the true story of Quoc Pham, a former South Vietnamese naval officer, and his wife Kim-Cuong. It tells of the love between a man and a woman and their courage in the face of hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a story of a people  of what happened in Vietnam while the world looked away.&lt;/p&gt;" />
