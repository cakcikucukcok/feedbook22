  <title>Minister of Truth - Basher-47 Pen Name</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Minister of Truth&quot; is the inside story of official corruption, as told by one of its victims.  The title is taken from the character in the novel &quot;1984&quot;, by George Orwell.  The job of that character was to continually revise and coordinate lies, which were then told to the public as truth.  The military officer depicted on the cover has a career-long history of lies, both small and great.  This thoroughly documented expose` reveals names, dates, locations, etc., involving those lies.  The history and pattern of those lies covers topics from individual (career advancement) through regional (environmental contamination) to societal (the aftermath of the &quot;9-11&quot; terrorist attacks).  Although covering such broad topics, this is not a &quot;boat anchor&quot; of a book.  It can be read in a two-hour sitting.  Yet, it contains plenty of verifying documentation.  If you want to understand the pervasive nature of government corruption, and how many lives it can actually affect, then &quot;Minister of Truth&quot; is a must-read." />
