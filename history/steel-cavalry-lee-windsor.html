  <title>Steel Cavalry - Lee Windsor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of the transformation from of a horse cavalry unit to one of Canada&#39;s most famous armoured regiments.  Twentieth century warfare is epitomized by the image of Allied tanks growling across the countryside, engaging their Nazi counterparts. One of the most storied of such regiments is the 8th (New Brunswick) Hussars. Founded in 1848 as the first volunteer cavalry regiment in British North America, the Hussars began the Second World War as a Motorcycle Regiment before converting to tanks in 1941. First posted to Italy in late 1943, the regiment was introduced to war near Ortona. They formed part of the great drive beyond Monte Cassino to Rome. But their reputation was forged at the Gothic Line and Coriano Ridge during two weeks that marked their fiercest and bloodiest trial of the war. Steel Cavalry: The 8th (New Brunswick) Hussars and the Second World War is volume 18 in the New Brunswick Military Heritage Series." />
