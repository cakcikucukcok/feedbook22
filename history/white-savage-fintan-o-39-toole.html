  <title>White Savage - Fintan O&#39;Toole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A provocative new biography of the man who forged America&#39;s alliance with the Iroquois&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Johnson was scarcely more than a boy when he left Ireland and his Gaelic, Catholic family to become a Protestant in the service of Britain&#39;s North American empire. In New York by 1738, Johnson moved to the frontiers along the Mohawk River, where he established himself as a fur trader and eventually became a landowner with vast estates; served as principal British intermediary with the Iroquois Confederacy; command British, colonial, and Iroquois forces that defeated the French in the battle of Lake George in 1755; and created the first groups of &quot;rangers,&quot; who fought like Indians and led the way to the Patriots&#39; victories in the Revolution.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Fintan O&#39;Toole&#39;s superbly researched, colorfully dramatic narrative makes clear, the key to Johnson&#39;s signal effectiveness was the style in which he lived as a &quot;white savage.&quot; Johnson had two wives, one European, one Mohawk; became fluent in Mohawk; and pioneered the use of Indians as active partners in the making of a new America. O&#39;Toole&#39;s masterful use of the extraordinary (often hilariously misspelled) documents written by Irish, Dutch, German, French, and Native American participants in Johnson&#39;s drama enlivens the account of this heroic figure&#39;s legendary career; it also suggests why Johnson&#39;s early multiculturalism unraveled, and why the contradictions of his enterprise created a historical dead end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
