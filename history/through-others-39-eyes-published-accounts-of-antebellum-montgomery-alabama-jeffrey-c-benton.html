  <title>Through Others&#39; Eyes: Published Accounts of Antebellum Montgomery, Alabama - Jeffrey C. Benton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through Others&#39; Eyes includes descriptions of traveling to and from Montgomery, but it focuses on the travelers&#39; descriptions of Montgomery itself. The published accounts included in the book were written between 1825 and 1861 by Americans and Europeans with a variety of backgrounds. A few are as objective as can reasonably be expected considering the short durations of the writers&#39; visits. Some are prone to display their preconceptions and prejudices. Most exaggerate -- they had to make their books marketable. The accounts are sometimes insightful or incredulous, often humorous and colorful, always giving the reader a vicarious experience of being there.   For most of its forty-year antebellum history, Montgomery was a frontier river town. These accounts of it do not reveal moonlight and magnolias, but a rather coarse culture. The touring authors don&#39;t mince words about slavery; after all, their readers expected commentary about the most peculiar of Southern institutions. However, the writers&#39; diverse views of slavery are as complicated and contradictory as was the institution itself.  Together, these accounts sketch a fascinating world populated by individuals and with customs that would have inspired Charles Dickens had he overcome his prejudices and ventured further south than Richmond in 1842. The &quot;Epilogue&quot; provides a description of the first capital of the Confederacy." />
