      <meta name="description" content="At 8:39 p.m. on July 16,1999 John F. Kennedy Jr., son of former President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Lee Bouvier, departed from Essex County Airport (IATA: CDW), a public use airport located in Fairfield Township, Essex County. His destination was Martha&#39;s Vineyard Airport. Kennedy checked in with the air traffic control tower of Martha&#39;s Vinayard Airport before departure. There were three persons on board the Piper Saratoga: John F. Kennedy Jr, his wife Carolyn Bessette, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette. Martha&#39;s Vineyard Airport (IATA: MVY) is an airport located in the middle of the island of Martha&#39;s Vineyard, just south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Kennedy&#39;s plane never arrived in Martha&#39;s Vineyard. The plane wreck was discovered in the Atlantic Ocean two days later. All three inhabitants of the plane were dead. The cause of the crash was spatial disorientation." />
