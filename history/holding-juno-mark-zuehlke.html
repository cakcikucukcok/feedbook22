  <title>Holding Juno - Mark Zuehlke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Following his national best-seller, &lt;I&gt;Juno Beach&lt;/I&gt;, and with his usual verve and narrative skill, historian &lt;B&gt;Mark Zuehlke&lt;/B&gt; chronicles the crucial six days when Canadians saved the vulnerable beachheads they had won during the D-Day landings.&amp;#160;D-Day ended with the Canadians six miles inland &amp;#151; the deepest penetration achieved by Allied forces during this longest day in history. But for all the horror endured on June 6 every soldier knew the worst was yet to come. The Germans began probing the Canadian lines early in the morning of June 7 and shortly after dawn counter attacked in force. The ensuing six days of battle was to prove bloodier than D-Day itself. Although battered and bloody, the Canadians had held their ground and made it possible for the slow advance toward Germany and eventual Allied victory to begin.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Holding Juno&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; recreates this pivotal battle through the eyes of the soldiers who fought it, with the same dramatic intensity and factual detail that made &lt;I&gt;Juno Beach&lt;/I&gt;, in the words of Quill &amp; Quire reviewer Michael Clark, &amp;#147;the defining popular history of Canada&amp;#8217;s D-Day battle.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
