  <title>Grandpa Was a Deity - William Lawrence Lipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What began with a basic curiosity of an adoptee about his biological origins, became a genetic exploration into history when he discovered two of his identifying y-chromosome markers created a rare, but traceable, combination which appeared in supporting data of multiple research papers. This book explores both his documented ancestry and that revealed by his y-DNA. 
Along the way, everything in his personal history seems to contribute in some way to the results of his research. The most significant element of that personal history is probably his learned inability to allow himself to be defeated by transient intellectual problems, or perceived handicap.
In the process of joining him as he searches for his past, you will be exposed to techniques that can assist you in discovering aspect of your own genealogy which you may never have considered. You will also, as he states in the book, be introduced to secret knowledge contained in the Book of Genesis. As part of that knowledge, you will learn why the patriarchs were given lifespans ranging from several hundred to nearly a thousand years. You will learn of a connection between Stonehenge, Britains earthwork hedges, and the Great Pyramids  one that does not involve, or invoke, alien astronauts.
Many books have garnered the labeled Groundbreaking, but seldom has there been one that is so current as to render the use of any conventional bibliography superfluous. Almost weekly there are new findings in the fields of DNA ancestry, archaeology and the relatively new field of astro-archaeology. Amazingly, they all seem to reinforce the connections and associations revealed here. But you might also discover things about the factual underpinnings of religion which you might not wish to know, or think about. Not the least of which is why there was time when the wisest people believed their Grandpa was a Deity." />
