  <title>The Ravenmaster - Christopher Skaife</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first behind-the-scenes account of life with the legendary ravens at the world&#39;s eeriest monument&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ravens at the Tower of London are of mighty importance: rumor has it that if a raven from the Tower should ever leave, the city will fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title of Ravenmaster, therefore, is a serious title indeed, and after decades of serving the Queen, Yeoman Warder Christopher Skaife took on the added responsibility of caring for the infamous ravens. In &lt;i&gt;The Ravenmaster&lt;/i&gt;, he lets us in on his life as he feeds his birds raw meat and biscuits soaked in blood, buys their food at Smithfield Market, and ensures that these unusual, misunderstood, and utterly brilliant corvids are healthy, happy, and ready to captivate the four million tourists who flock to the Tower every year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rewarding, intimate, and inspiring partnership has developed between the ravens and their charismatic and charming human, the Ravenmaster, who shares the folklore, history, and superstitions surrounding the ravens and the Tower. Shining a light on the behavior of the birds, their pecking order and social structure, and the tricks they play on us, Skaife shows who the Tower&#39;s true guardians really are--and the result is a compelling and irreverent narrative that will surprise and enchant.&lt;/p&gt;" />
