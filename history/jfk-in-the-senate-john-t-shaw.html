  <title>JFK in the Senate - John T. Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Before John F. Kennedy became a legendary young president he was the junior senator from Massachusetts. The Senate was where JFK&#39;s presidential ambitions were born and first realized. In the first book to deal exclusively with JFK&#39;s Senate years, author John T. Shaw looks at how the young Senator was able to catapult himself on the national stage. Tip O&#39;Neill once quipped that Kennedy received more publicity for less accomplishment than anyone in Congress. But O&#39;Neill didn&#39;t understand that Kennedy saw a different path to congressional influence and ultimately the presidency. Unlike Lyndon Johnson, the Democratic leader in the Senate, JFK never aspired to be &quot;The Master of the Senate&quot; who made deals and kept the institution under his control. Instead, he envisioned himself as a &quot;Historian-Scholar-Statesman&quot; in the mold of his hero Winston Churchill which he realized with the 1957 publication of &lt;i&gt;Profiles of Courage &lt;/i&gt;that earned JFK a Pulitzer Prize and public limelight. Smart, dashing, irreverent and literary, the press could not get enough of him. Yet, largely overlooked has been Kennedy&#39;s tenure on a special Senate committee to identify the five greatest senators in American history--JFK&#39;s work on this special panel coalesced his relationships in Congress, and helped catapult him toward the presidency. Based on primary documents from JFK&#39;s Senate years as well as memoirs, oral histories, and interviews with his top aides, &lt;i&gt;JFK in the Senate&lt;/i&gt; provides new insight into an underappreciated aspect of his political career.&lt;/p&gt;" />
