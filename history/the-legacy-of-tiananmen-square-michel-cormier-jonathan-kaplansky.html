  <title>The Legacy of Tiananmen Square - Michel Cormier, Jonathan Kaplansky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the loosening of restrictions on the Chinese economy in the 1980s and 1990s and the rise of the middle class, many observers thought that Western-style democracy would soon follow. Instead, China has adopted its own version, with a market-driven economy where actions that might call into question the decisions of the governing party are strictly forbidden. In this fascinating account, Cormier chronicles numerous failed attempts to bring democracy to China in the last century, starting with a handful of brave souls who tried to move China towards a constitutional monarchy at the turn of the century and peaking with the student uprising of 1989. Using historical research &amp;#40;including surprising transcripts from Party meetings&amp;#41; and candid interviews with many of the dissidents &amp;#8212; some now living in exile, others under house arrest in China &amp;#8212; Cormier tells the very human story of real people struggling for human rights and freedoms. The Legacy of Tiananmen Square was originally published in French as Les h&amp;#233;ritiers de Tiananmen. This updated edition was translated by Jonathan Kaplansky." />
