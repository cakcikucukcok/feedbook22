  <title>Over the Wall of Oppression - John Ardent, R.J. Konczyk, J. Daniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Did you ever pray the Lords Prayer, where you prayed for the coming of the kingdom of God on earth, Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in heaven? This is the only prayer that Jesus gave us. Did you ever wonder what it actually means?
This kingdom of God on earth is a real kingdom with a king. This king is a hereditary position that fulfills Gods promise that he gave to King David that his lineage and throne shall endure forever.
God has already sent the return of Christ, and he is a male descendant of the Davidic kings. He did not come according to the imagination of man. Rather, he came fulfilling prophecy. He brought a new revelation through which the kingdom of God on earth that Jesus taught us to pray for will be firmly established throughout the entire world.
His revelation is the culmination of all the previous revelations given by God through his messengers. As what happened with all previous revelations, man has taken what was originally intended and changed it according to his own limited capacity and selfish desires. In so doing, mankind has been deprived of the truth of Gods will and purpose and his glorious covenant for a new age.
This new revelation was given by the glory of the Father through the words of Jesus the Christ and written down by Mark in chapter 8, verse 38: For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his father.
As Jesus foretold, the name of the return of Christ is Bahaullah. He came well over 150 years ago. Placed in chains, beaten, and put in prison, Bahaullah spent forty years proclaiming Gods new covenant to the people, writing to the kings and rulers of the earth, imploring them to turn to God. Bahaullahs message has gone unheeded. As in ages past, those who did hear and embrace his message later turned their hearts away from God, choosing instead to seek earthly power and riches. Those who were to protect and serve the covenant of Bahaullah as well as his chosen ones after him created an oppression so great that the people of the world have been denied this glorious message.
Dr. Leland Jensen, mentioned here in Over the Wall of Oppression, was a third-generation Bahai. He began teaching this new faith at the age of seventeen, and since that time, he devoted his entire life to teaching this wonderful message of the kingdom. He was well acquainted with biblical scripture and the Bahai teachings, being very successful in bringing new believers into the faith. He was present when the faith was hijacked by a group of people whose sole purpose was to protect and serve the covenant, and thus he had considerable knowledge of events that transpired at that time. The facts presented within these pages are written in very clear and understandable language so all may know of the deeds done. This text provides a great opportunity for those who do not have the understanding of those events or the meaning of the covenant to come out from under this great oppression and embrace the glorious truth.
We have been blessed with having known him for nearly two decades and with hearing this message directly from him. We not only learned of the Bahai faith but also the real meaning of our existence and purpose in life. His love for Bahaullah and for God showed in everything that he did. We would stay up for hours, listening to his words, thirsty for more.
Over the Wall of Oppression isnt only for the Bahais but also for the Christians. The explanations and commentaries on various Christian subjects and prophecy will truly open ones eyes to the truth of such subjects as the meaning of the word Christ, the history of the trinity, the meaning of the Resurrection, the beast, and more. Part 2 consists of the explanations and commentaries on the book of Revelation, which is a message of the kingdom and the catastrophe." />
