  <title>State and Citizen: British America and the Early United States - Peter Thompson, Peter S. Onuf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointing the way to a new history of the transformation of British     subjects into American citizens, &lt;i&gt;State and Citizen&lt;/i&gt; challenges the presumption     that the early American state was weak by exploring the changing legal and political meaning of     citizenship. The volume&#39;s distinguished contributors cast new light on the shift from     subjecthood to citizenship during the American Revolution by showing that the federal state     played a much greater part than is commonly supposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going beyond master     narratives-celebratory or revisionist-that center on founding principles, the contributors argue     that geopolitical realities and the federal state were at the center of early American political     development. The volume&#39;s editors, Peter Thompson and Peter S. Onuf, bring together     political science and historical methodologies to demonstrate that citizenship was a political     as well as a legal concept. The American state, this collection argues, was formed and evolved     in a more dialectical relationship between citizens and government authority than is generally     acknowledged. Suggesting points of comparison between an American narrative of state     development-previously thought to be exceptional-and those of Europe and Latin America, the     contributors break fresh ground by investigating citizenship in its historical context rather     than by reference only to its capacity to confer privileges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
