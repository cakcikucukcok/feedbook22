  <title>Out from Hiding - Dell F. Sanchez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Dell Sanchez began his journey into the lineage of his Latino family when it surfaced from his research of Jewish survivors of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions of the 15th  17th Centuries. The more Sanchez
dug into historical record, the more he began to suspect his own Sephardic Jewish roots. The DNA of his mother and father served to prove his suspicions.&lt;p&gt;
Presented as a personal yet factual narrative, &lt;i&gt;Out from Hiding&lt;/i&gt; includes six crucial topics that prove the existence of Sephardic Jewish roots among Latinos:&lt;p&gt;
 Historical and genealogical records&lt;br&gt;
 DNA evidence corroborating Sephardic Jewish roots among Latinos&lt;br&gt;
 Onomastics dealing with the Sephardic origin of surnames&lt;br&gt;
 Material evidence found within the Sephardic Latino community&lt;br&gt;
 Oral histories disclosing family secrets of thirteen Sephardic Latinos&lt;br&gt;
 Sanchezs professional observations and
prognostications of the Sephardic Latinos future&lt;p&gt;
Based on continued research, it has been estimated that there are tens of thousands of Hispanic/Latinos with Sephardic Jewish ancestry in America. The majority of these are
not aware of their hidden Jewish roots, arent aware of their hidden backgrounds. &lt;i&gt;Out from Hiding&lt;/i&gt; is his journey through history, family genealogy, and personal faith. Perhaps it
may be your journey, as well." />
