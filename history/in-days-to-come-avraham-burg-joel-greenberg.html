  <title>In Days to Come - Avraham Burg, Joel Greenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The first childhood memory I have of my father is linked to the destruction of empires--the collapse of a world order that had once seemed eternal.&quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So begins Avraham Burg&#39;s authoritative and deeply personal inquiry into the ambitions and failures of Israel and Judaism worldwide.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Born in 1955, Burg witnessed firsthand many of the most dramatic and critical moments in Israeli history. Here, he chronicles the highs and lows of his country over the last five decades, threading his own journey into the story of his people. He explores the misplaced hopes of religious Zionism through the lens of his conservative upbringing, explains Israel&#39;s obsession with military might while relating his own experiences as a paratrooper officer, and probes the country&#39;s democratic aspirations, informed by his tenure in the Knesset.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With bravery and candor, Burg lays bare the seismic intellectual shifts that drove the country&#39;s political and religious journeys, offering a prophecy of fury and consolation and a vision for a new comprehensive paradigm for Judaism, Israel, and the Middle East. &lt;/div&gt;" />
