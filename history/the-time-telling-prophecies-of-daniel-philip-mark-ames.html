  <title>The Time-Telling Prophecies of Daniel - Philip Mark Ames</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you know what time it is? No, not according to the hands on your wristwatch or the digital display on your cellphone. Do you know what time it is on Gods clock? Do you know the recent events that have occurred at the precise moments for which they had been scheduled by God? And do you know the pre-ordained dates on which specific near-future events are set to occur? 
Gods schedule of certain events was given to a man who spent his life serving and advising the kings of two of the greatest empires of ancient times. But he was told that those time schedules were sealed and could not be understood until the time of the end. 
Now they have been opened. And the understanding of those prophetic time-tables is being made available, some of them for the first time ever, in this book. In clear, simple terms, you will learn the meanings of all the time-telling prophecies contained in the writings of the Prophet Daniel. And you will be amazed, even astonished, when you find out what time it really is." />
