  <title>Fighting the Kaiserreich - Bruce Gaunson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book portrays a modern epic - of an army that sailed across the world to fight a war. Its struggle with the Kaiserreich (German empire) became the most formidable campaign Australian troops have ever fought. By the time Monash&#39;s soldiers broke through the Hindenburg Line, their achievement and its cost were staggering.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This epic was created by normal Australians, and is understandable to normal Australians. Here, you won&#39;t need expertise in military terminology. But to appreciate the titanic conflict the Diggers had entered, you&#39;ll find a clear picture of the Great War - its key issues and extraordinary events.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before this book was written Australians could not get, in one concise volume, the two interwoven sagas - of Australia&#39;s epic and the Great War itself. That&#39;s what this lively and vigorous book offers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It draws on the sources of thirteen countries to present as many good unknowns (women, men and fascinating situations) as it does big leaders, events, generals and battles. In debate it&#39;s not shackled to old predictables, and while mindful of general readers, it relies throughout on sound scholarship. For good measure, it bombards a few fallacies and their well-overdue authors." />
