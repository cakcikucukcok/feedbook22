  <title>The Lithuanians - Audrey Adams Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    The Lithuanians is a story of two brothers, Mikael a Roman Catholic priest, and Erik an officer in the Third Reich, and the extraordinary journey to find
    each other. It is also a love story between Mikael and Sophie a beautiful resistance fighter and Erik and Sara who find love on Half Way Island during the
    days of World War II and his commitment to find Sara after the war ended.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As the war ends Sophie moves to England to begin a life without Mikael. She eventually marries a man much older then she is, and they immigrate to the
    United States where she meets Lukas, the handsome son (a doctor) of her wealthy husband. Their torrid love affair is brief and ends tragically.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Michael, a Roman Catholic priest adopted by a couple in Lithuanian, and Erik, an officer in the Third Reich raised by a German couple, finally celebrate
    the reunion that had been denied to them for three decades.
