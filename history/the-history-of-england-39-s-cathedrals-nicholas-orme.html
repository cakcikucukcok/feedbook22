  <title>The History of England&#39;s Cathedrals - Nicholas Orme</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘An ancient cathedral records more than its own private history. Indeed it can be read as a miniature history of England. We are treading in the footsteps of Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Normans, Tudors, Stuarts, Hanoverians, Victorians, and they all left their mark.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;England’s sixty or so Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals are among its most iconic buildings and attract thousands of worshippers and visitors every year. Yet though much has been written about their architecture, there is no complete guide to their history and activities. This book provides the first rounded account of the whole of their 1700 years from Roman times to the present day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It explains the layout of their buildings, the people who ran them, their worship and music, their links with learning and education, and their outreach to society. It relates their history to the history of England and show how they adapted to change and weathered disasters to survive as great repositories of our national history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
