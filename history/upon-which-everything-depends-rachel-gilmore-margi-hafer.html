  <title>Upon Which Everything Depends - Rachel Gilmore, Margi Hafer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Rachel Gilmore fell in love with the story of Civil War General William Tecumseh Shermans horse, Sam, and his connection to Frankfort, Illinois, while handling publicity for a sculpture dedication honoring the pair. However, what Gilmore discovered as she began to research the story behind the story was that Sams legendary status for making the longest equine march in military history was, in fact, a legend. According to the generals own journal entries and personal correspondence during the war, Sherman, in an unusual display of compassion and family loyalty, sent Sam home mid-war after the death of his oldest son, Willy. Yet the newly uncovered evidence doesnt change the fact that Sams role in the war was one upon which everything depends, at least for Shermans sense of duty and honor. And, what emerges from the generals words are two compelling historical horse talesthat of Civil War hero and faithful family friend." />
