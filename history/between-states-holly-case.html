  <title>Between States - Holly Case</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Winner of the 2010 George Louis Beer Prize of the American Historical Association.
The struggle between Hungary and Romania for control of Transylvania seems at first sight a side-show in the story of the Nazi New Order and the Second World War. These allies of the Third Reich spent much of the war arguing bitterly over Transylvania&#39;s future, and Germany and Italy were drawn into their dispute to prevent it from spiraling into a regional war. But precisely as a result of this interaction, the story of the Transylvanian Question offers a new way into the history of how state leaders and national elites have interpreted what &quot;Europe&quot; means. Tucked into the folds of the Transylvanian Question&#39;s bizarre genealogy is a secret that no one ever tried to keep, but that has remained a secret nonetheless: small states matter. The perspective of small states puts the struggle for mastery among its Great Powers into a new perspective." />
