  <title>The History of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Canada - Ainsley Baldwin, John O&#39;Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; The history of Gaelic games in Canada, before the founding of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Ireland in 1884 and in the years since, proves a determination by Irish immigrants who have arrived in numerous provinces of Canada. Through their dedication the flag of Irish sports has flown strong, and will continue to fly in the years to come.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sporting traditions include the oldest European field game of hurling-a masterful art and the fastest game in the world-in which players use an ash wood stick and a hard ball. Many argue with some conviction, and no small amount of fact to support their case, that Canada&#39;s national sport, ice hockey, has its origins in hurling. The word puck is derived from the Irish word poc, which is the action of striking the ball with a hurley. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1845, the civic fathers of Quebec City banned the playing of hurling in their narrow streets, while in St. John&#39;s, Newfoundland, hurling was being played as early as 1788 at the &quot;Barrens&quot; of the city. The ladies&#39; version of hurling, Camogie, has had its presence on occasion in some Canadian communities.
The skilful play of Gaelic Football, which has dominated the sporting scene across the country in many Canadian cities, continues to be the greatest strength in modern times. Along with two other Irish sports of handball and rounders, many wonderful memories for the Canadian-Irish community are celebrated in this book that captures an exciting facet of Irish culture.
