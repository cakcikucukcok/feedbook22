  <title>The Eisenhower Years: a Social History of the 1950&#39;S - Richard T. Stanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Fabulous Fifties were America&#39;s &quot;Happy Days.&quot; The Eisenhower Years produced amazing contributions to our American culture -- and to other cultures around the world. In so many ways, Americans innovated, and the world imitated -- from Elvis Presley and rock &#39;n&#39; roll to the Salk anti-polio vaccine. America&#39;s contributions to the world included motion pictures and the Broadway stage; radio and television; amateur and professional sports; jazz, the &quot;blues,&quot; country-and-Western music, traditional ballads and popular songs, and rock &#39;n&#39; roll; domestic and international business and trade; public and private educational opportunities; and a rich and varied literature. While Americans did not invent all these categories, they nevertheless took each to new heights during the Eisenhower Years, and shared their bounty with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eisenhower Years, generally speaking, were happier, more stable, more prosperous, more optimistic, and simpler times then the preceding decades of the 1930&#39;s and &#39;40&#39;s and the increasingly turbulent 1960&#39;s and &#39;70&#39;s that followed. In fact, America&#39;s exuberance in so many areas of the arts and everyday life was omnipresent. As for political and military achievements, President Eisenhower kept us safely out of war, and was wise enough to stay out of the way of Americas artists and entrepreneurs. As a result, the Eisenhower Years should forever be remembered as those &quot;Happy Days.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
