Most of them served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force—the Canada Corps that distinguished itself on the battlefields of Ypres, the Somme, Vimy, and Passchendaele. Four of these men were killed in action. Four were decorated for gallantry. Twenty-seven were volunteers, and five were conscripted under the &lt;i&gt;Military Service Act&lt;/i&gt; of 1917.
