  <title>Nigerian Women of Distinction, Honour and Exemplary Presidential Qualities - Jubril Olabode Aka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="NIGERIAN WOMEN OF DISTINCTION, HONOUR
AND
 EXEMPLARY PRESIDENTIAL QUALITIES;
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL GENDERS
	The book identifies scores of Nigerian revered women who match the most dignified women world-wide. Their wonderful attributes can lead Nigeria to the Promised Land sooner than expected if given equal leadership opportunities. They abound in all professions including those exclusively left for men and they perform with excellence.  
	It highlights socio-political activism of Chief Abigail Olufunmilayo Ransom-Kuti (25/10/1900-13/4/1978); Chief Hannah Awolowos successes and unflinching support for her husbands course, Chief Obufemi Awolowo, first Premier of Western Nigeria, her revered Yorubaland eldership; and unparalleled antecedents of Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala; Professor Dora Akunyili; Chief Olubunmi Etteh, first female Nigerian House Speaker; Chief Farida Waziri, EFCC ex-Chairperson and many others comprising 190 Nigerian women (past and present) with great and wonderful antecedents.  
	Behind successful men are great women. When women are trained, knowledge spreads and impacts entire community.  Women have inherent powers of accomplishments, invincibility and indispensability.
	Ironically, physically and economically powerful male chauvinists think they control everything, but their wives or girl-friends really take charge and control everything remotely including the powerful men.  
	Imagine the world without women; it will be dull, boring, wifeless, motherless, childless and uninteresting without love, care, romance, beauty, affection, attractiveness, happiness and child production. It condemns discrimination, domestic violence, women and child abuse world-wide.  Women can lead exemplarily if given equal opportunities as men. 
                                   GOD BLESS NIGERIAN WOMEN!" />
