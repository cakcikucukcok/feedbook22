  <title>Men from Under the Sky: The Arrival of Westerners in Fiji - Stanley Brown, Raymond Burr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The cannibal kings of Fiji are gone, but their spirit lives on.  Cannibalism in Fiji and the gruesome &quot;earth ovens&quot; are gone; the &lt;I&gt;kai vavalagi,&lt;/I&gt; &quot;the men from over the horizon,&quot; changed that, bringing their own brands of justice tempered by the musket, disease, and dissoluteness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There were giants in those days, Fijians and Westerners alike.  This gripping and unique history of Fiji by Stanley Brown, a well-known Fiji &quot;old-timer&quot; and historian, is woven around the lives of eleven Western &quot;giants,&quot; Europeans and Americans who had the greatest impact on each epoch. Not all these Westerners lived to tell the tale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This stirring narrative is replete with hair-raising accounts of battles and brutality.  One incident of supreme savagery was reported by Lockerby, a famous trader, who reported that more than three hundred fifty old men, women and children were butchered after a battle: &quot;As the canoes sallied back tot he mainland coast in the evening, the reddening sky silhouetted the bodies of children hanging from the mastheads.&quot;  The earth&amp;#150;ovens were well&amp;#150;fueled that evening. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But time and the tides of civilization tame the savage beast, and today Fiji is busy developing its economy, but the old accounts and stories still ring true.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
