  <title>Eclipse - Nicholas Clee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Watching Eclipse is the man who wants to buy him. An adventurer and rogue who has made his money through gambling, Dennis O&#39;Kelly is also a known companion to the madam of a notorious London brothel. Under O&#39;Kelly&#39;s management, Eclipse would go on a winning streak unparalleled for the next two centuries.   As journalist Nicholas Clee explores in this captivating romp, while O&#39;Kelly was destined to remain an outcast to the racing establishment, his horse would go on to become the undisputed, undefeated champion of the sport. Not only a consummate winner, Eclipse exemplified the perfect thoroughbred -- a status he retains even today. Eclipse&#39;s male-line descendants include Secretariat, Barbaro, and all but three of the Kentucky Derby winners of the past fifty years.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
