  <title>The End of Loyalty - Rick Wartzman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Having a good, stable job used to be the bedrock of the American Dream. Not anymore.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;In this richly detailed and eye-opening book, Rick Wartzman chronicles the erosion of the relationship between American companies and their workers. Through the stories of four major employers--General Motors, General Electric, Kodak, and Coca-Cola--he shows how big businesses once took responsibility for providing their workers and retirees with an array of social benefits. At the height of the post-World War II economy, these companies also believed that worker pay needed to be kept high in order to preserve morale and keep the economy humming. Productivity boomed.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;But the corporate social contract didn&#39;t last. By tracing the ups and downs of these four corporate icons over seventy years, Wartzman illustrates just how much has been lost: job security and steadily rising pay, guaranteed pensions, robust health benefits, and much more. Charting the Golden Age of the &#39;50s and &#39;60s; the turbulent years of the &#39;70s and &#39;80s; and the growth of downsizing, outsourcing, and instability in the modern era, Wartzman&#39;s narrative is a biography of the American Dream gone sideways.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Deeply researched and compelling, &lt;i&gt;The End of Loyalty&lt;/i&gt; will make you rethink how Americans can begin to resurrect the middle class.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalist for the &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times &lt;/i&gt;book prize in current interest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;A best business book of the year in economics, &lt;i&gt;Strategy+Business&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
