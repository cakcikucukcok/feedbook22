  <title>The Final World Government - Bassey Effiong Orok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the last title of the seven holy book series written simultaneously in thirty-four months by a born prophet, seasoned and reputable spiritual scientist and consultant on issues related to nature and the universe at large, His Lordship Bishop Bassey Effiong Orok. After his consecration as bishop on Sunday, April 12, 2009, he was taken away by the Holy Spirit, passing through several borders and nations. And on the twelfth month after he was consecrated a bishop, he was given authority to settle down, being hidden from public sight, and the Holy Spirit led him to write the seven holy books series, namely, Holy Book of Revelations; Everlasting Arts and Sciences volumes 1 and 2; and Eternal Mysteries of Nations volumes 1, 2, and 3, including this very title. However, The Final World Government contains unimaginable and extraordinary knowledge. It is beyond human description and interpretation as it unveils the coming new world administration where only one governing system, one currency, one understanding, one belief and one language will be enforced globally, thereby bringing to an end all existing governments, organizations, groups, religions, tradition, beliefs, customs, and kingdoms irrespective of nation, language, continent, or colour. It announces the coming unavoidable global change (far from the present) as it unveils a world void of all political, civil, economic, food crises, agony, anger, catastrophe, blame, earthquakes, war, pain, enmity, insecurity, insurgency, terrorism, wickedness, danger, evil, sorrow, sickness and death. It gives in-depth and first-time knowledge on the natural origin of the different governments currently operating globally and moving ahead in unveiling the system of their final departure from the surface of the earth. It also unveils unprecedented mysteries concerning all continents, governments, organizations, religions, tribes, tongues, colours and every human race, even as it reveals how the entire earth and the heavens will be shaken thus causing man and other creations to run for their safety." />
