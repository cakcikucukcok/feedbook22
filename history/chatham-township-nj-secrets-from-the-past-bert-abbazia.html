  <title>Chatham Township, Nj: Secrets from the Past - Bert Abbazia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The history of this unique endeavor is written by an eye witness to the rise and demise of Americas Fourteenth Colony. The story is the result of the author retrieving original documents to verify the people and events of an odyssey that spanned five decades. The story is collaborated by the survivors and the beneficiaries of an experiment, for a better way of life, by a group of predominately Eastern European and Russian Jews with their political shades of red philosophy settling into what was a predominately conservative Chatham Township, a rural community in Central New Jersey. It is a story of objection, rejection, suspicion, ridicule and ultimately, assimilation and acceptance. The story has been influenced and colored by the authors personal observations and personal experiences while growing up in the Colony. Bert Abbazia was a Colony Boy." />
