  <title>Pocahontas to Benjamin Bolling - Oakley Dean Baldwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My family has always claimed that we descended from Pocahontas. Before the internet back in the late 1980&#39;s my uncle Johnny Beverly and his wife Marge spent the better part of a week in the Wise County, Virginia Courthouse researching and reviewing documents as to our Bolling lineage. They tracked U.S. Federal Census records, marriage licenses, wills, and other Wise County, Virginia Courthouse documents back to Major Benjamin Bolling who was born in 1734.  It is to my understanding that there has been an ongoing disagreement for many years between different families and genealogical groups disagreeing over Major Benjamin Bolling&#39;s actual lineage. His descendants insist he is related to Pocahontas and other genealogical organizations believe he is not.  So far no documents have been found that state definitely just who Benjamin&#39;s parents were. Family folklore is that Major John Bolling and Elizabeth Blair are the parents of Benjamin, they descend from Pocahontas." />
