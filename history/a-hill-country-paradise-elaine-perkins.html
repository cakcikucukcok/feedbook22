  <title>A Hill Country Paradise? - Elaine Perkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1800s, land speculators said that Western Travis County in Texas would be a paradise, a perfect place to grow crops, raise livestock, and build a life. Settlers were seduced by such stories, and many of themincluding a large segment of German immigrantsmade their way to this promised land. What they found was, for the most part, an arid area of cedar trees, poor soil, rocks, and snakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, these hardy people carved out a good life for themselves, making the best of what they had, and their descendents continue to live in the area today. Historian and Travis County resident Elaine Perkins relates the tales of these settlers in &lt;i&gt;A Hill Country Paradise&lt;/i&gt;, a moving testament to the pioneer spirit that made this place prosperous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the earliest settlers through two world wars, Perkins reveals the tragedies and triumphs of those who made the county their home. This historical record brings this Texas countys past to life, recalling residents fighting for the Confederacy in the Civil War, breaking ground for a new homestead, rustling cattle, taking advantage of burgeoning business opportunities, squabbling, and heralding the arrival of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivid details, solid research, and an intriguing narrative make &lt;i&gt;A Hill Country Paradise&lt;/i&gt; not only educational, but also entertaining, securing the memory of this countys past for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
