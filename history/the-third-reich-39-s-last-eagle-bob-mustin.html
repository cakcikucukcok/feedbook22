  <title>The Third Reich&#39;s Last Eagle - Bob Mustin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hans-Ulrich Rudel loves his family, but he fears the Soviet threat more. After single-handedly destroying a Soviet battleship near Kronstadt Island, he returns home to marry fianc&amp;eacute;e Ursula. She travels with him to Austria, where he is to train&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Stuka&lt;/em&gt;dive-bomber pilots. This life soon has him on edge, and he requests transfer to the Crimea. There, he attacks constantly; he contracts jaundice and is hospitalized. Leaving the hospital without permission, he rejoins the famed Immelmann Wing on the Volga and enters the fight for Stalingrad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, he&amp;rsquo;s taken away to refit the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Stuka&lt;/em&gt;dive-bomber. Once again flying with the Immelmanns, his fame grows as he uses the refitted plane to decimate Soviet tanks at Kursk. Rudel now has a son, and Ursula&amp;rsquo;s letters divide the pilot&amp;rsquo;s attention between war and family. Rudel&amp;rsquo;s father Johannes has grown frustrated over Germany&amp;rsquo;s defeats in Russia, and he takes his frustrations out on his son. But at the moment, Rudel has little time for this&amp;mdash;Stalin has offered a one hundred thousand ruble reward for Rudel, dead or alive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudel begins openly to criticize the war&amp;rsquo;s handling; then near Budapest, he&amp;rsquo;s wounded. He asks for his Wing&amp;rsquo;s transfer to Germany to protect his family. There, as the Soviets cross the Oder River, Rudel finds combat orders not to his liking. The war&amp;rsquo;s downturn has pushed him into a state of megalomania&amp;mdash;he believes only his Wing can save Germany. He&amp;rsquo;s wounded, and this time he loses a leg. Determined to continue to fight, he returns to his Wing, now in Czechoslovakia, where he learns Hitler is dead, that Germany has surrendered.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His battered planes escape to Kitzingen, where an American major accuses Rudel of the Reich&amp;rsquo;s most egregious sins. No, he replies, I&amp;rsquo;m no Nazi; I&amp;rsquo;ve merely been defending my family and country against Bolshevism. Months later in England and still a prisoner, Rudel vows to continue fighting the Bolshevik threat he now believes threatens all of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
