  <title>Reel Rebels: the London Film-Makers&#39; Co-Operative 1966 to 1996 - Joy I. Payne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The London FilmMakers Cooperative was founded in 1966 by a group of artists who sought to explore the possibilities of the moving image whilst maintaining autonomy over the production, distribution, and exhibition of their work. Although their films were not overtly political, artists nevertheless expressed their political attitudes by creating nonnarrative films, thereby rejecting conventional narrative structures associated with mainstream, commercial cinema, which they perceived as supporting the dominant ideology in society. A return to narrative in the 1980s coincided with the introduction of British Art Cinema and the art-house films of Derek Jarman, Peter Greenaway, and Sally Potter, all of whom made experimental films in the early days of the London Co-op." />
