  <title>Brassankle - David G. Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A true history lesson deftly woven into the plot of a fictional novel of high adventure and intrigue with romantic interludes
Teenage Gray Cloud, well trained and adept in the skills of his Catawba hunter/warrior relatives, is deemed ready to go to Charles Town to further his education and to learn the ways of the white man.  He is given a white mans name, Truly Doran, by his father Sean Doran  long hunter, trapper, and guide/scout for the British.  Sean has amassed a tidy fortune, held in trust by his friend, Henry Siles, a ship factor in the port city. 
While studying at the newly founded college at Charles Town, Truly experiences many
exciting situations and becomes acquainted with famous historical persons.  He also experiences several love affairs with different girls (strumpets and nice girls).  He observes and eventually becomes involved in the conflict between hardscrabble farmers in the up-country and the spoiled scions of rich plantation owners. Befriended by Francis Marion, he later serves as chief scout for the Swamp Fox during the war of rebellion.  Early on, Truly fights beside Sgt. William Jasper under command of Col. William Moultrie at the palmetto-log fort on Sullivans Island. During the war he is assigned as a scout to Lt. Col. William Washingtons cavalry as the Patriot dragoons counter the murderous thrusts of the green-coated British Loyal Legion led by Lt. Col. Banister Bloody Ban Tarleton.  Although officially a member of Francis Marions legion, Truly is often detached for service as scout and fighter in skirmishes with other Patriot leaders throughout the colony.  He assists Daniel Morgan at the Cowpens, and Gates at Camden, and served in three battles trying to prevent the British from taking Charles Town. Truly is also involved in the decisive battles at the Waxhaws, Kings Mountain and Eutaw Springs, among others.  Throughout the war, he is active against Tarleton in a dozen major skirmishes." />
