  <title>Freedom Has a Face: Race, Identity, and Community in Jefferson&#39;s Virginia - Kirt von Daacke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his examination of a wide array of court papers from Albemarle County,     a rural Virginia slaveholding community, Kirt von Daacke argues against the commonly held belief     that southern whites saw free blacks only as a menace. Von Daacke reveals instead a more     easygoing interracial social order in Albemarle County that existed for more than two     generations after the Revolution-stretching to the mid-nineteenth century and beyond-despite     fears engendered by Gabriel&#39;s Rebellion and the Haitian Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     &lt;i&gt;Freedom Has a Face&lt;/i&gt; tells the stories of free blacks who worked hard to carve     out comfortable spaces for existence. They were denied full freedom, but they were neither     slaves without masters nor anomalies in a society that had room only for black slaves and free     white citizens. A typical rural Piedmont county, Albemarle was not a racial utopia. Rather, it     was a tight-knit community in which face-to-face interactions determined social status and     reputation. A steep social hierarchy allowed substantial inequalities to persist, but it was     nonetheless an intimately interracial society. Free African Americans who maintained personal     connections with white neighbors and who participated openly in local society were perceived as     far more than stereotypical dangerous blacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on his work building a     cross-referenced database containing individual records for nearly five thousand documents, von     Daacke reveals a detailed picture of daily life in Albemarle County. With this reinsertion of     individual free blacks into the neighborhood, community, and county, he exposes a different,     more complicated image of the lives of free people of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
