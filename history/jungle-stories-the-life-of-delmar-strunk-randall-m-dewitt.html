  <title>Jungle Stories: the Life of Delmar Strunk - Randall M Dewitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="JUNGLE STORIES: From the Fields of South Dakota to the Jungles of Burma details the remarkable journey of Scotland, South Dakota resident Delmar Strunk, who improbably became part of the famed Merrills Marauders fighting unit in Southeast Asia during World War II.
Strunk was born into the Roaring Twenties, a period of great prosperity in America, but quickly learned the plights and struggles of the Great Depression after the stock market crash of 1929.
Like most men of his generation, Delmar entered the service to fight for his country, becoming a soldier in the U.S. Army.
After serving admirably in the China-Burma-India Theater, Strunk returned home to create a life for himself.
Delmar forged a successful farming business following the war and even realized the time-honored tradition of working hand in hand with his son on the farm.
Into retirement, Strunk entrenched himself as a pillar of the community and participated in a multitude of activities, including serving as commander of the local VFW.
Strunks is a story of living the true American Dream, persevering through the tough times and enjoying the good.
