Here is the notorious Sada Abe, who mutilated her dead lover and whose story was filmed in Oshima&#39;s &lt;I&gt;The Realm of the Senses&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And here is Oshima himself, dead drunk and making perfect sense; here is the actress who played Abe, exiled in Rome.  Here too is the delivery boy who kills himself for love, the girl who loved a Korean, and the actress, a public idol, who suddenly and permanently disappeared from view.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
