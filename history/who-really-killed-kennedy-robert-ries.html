  <title>Who Really Killed Kennedy? - Robert Ries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this exciting new book, the author lays the groundwork for establishing the conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy by providing critical details regarding the election of Jack Kennedy and how his subsequent actions in office so offended a number of powerful men and agencies that they then had the motive to plan and carry out his assassination.
Through careful examination of evidence, including the Warren Commission Report itself, the author lays out the details of the assassination. Paying close attention to the weapon supposedly used by Lee Oswald, Oswalds actual movements, the wounds that Kennedy suffered, and statements provided by witnesses, the author establishes that Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill President Kennedy and that Kennedy suffered a minimum of three wounds from a minimum of three bullets coming from three different directions.thus a conspiracy!
This book then moves to its critical juncture where it points out the Warren Commission Report omissions, unsubstantiated conclusions, and conclusions in direct contradiction with the very evidence it collected! From the evidence, the author then constructs his complete scenario of how the assassination occurred and who perpetrated it. He then explains how Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover could manipulate and control the Warren Commission to report that Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President Kennedy. He concludes his book with a provocative proposal to conduct a new investigation, exhume President Kennedys body, and firmly establish the truth of the conspiracy beyond all reasonable doubt.
Read this book and learn the truth about how the American nation was deceived and duped by its highest government officials and agencies." />
