Stone, librarian of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, assembled newspaper articles, editorials, and records about the debates in Pennsylvania&#39;s ratifying convention. In addition to speeches and essays by both supporters and opponents of the Constitution, noninterpretive editorial comments are also presented to introduce the documents and&amp;#160;place them in the appropriate historical context. Also included in the volume are biographical sketches of key figures in Pennsylvania during this significant period of the American Founding, including Benjamin Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, Benjamin Rush, and James Wilson.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Pennsylvania was one of the first states to ratify the U.S. Constitution. Twenty hours after the Continental Congress submitted the Constitution to the states, the Assembly of Pennsylvania called a convention to ratify or reject it. The Constitution immediately became the subject of passionate debate, which continued until Washington was sworn in, in 1789. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Pennsylvania and the Federal Constitution &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;collects the primary documents that formed this passionate debate.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;John Bach McMaster &lt;/STRONG&gt;(1852-1932) worked as a civil engineer, taught civil engineering at Princeton University, and was Professor of American History at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frederick D.
