  <title>The Great Fire of London: In That Apocalyptic Year, 1666 - Neil Hanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Acclaim for &lt;i&gt;The Great Fire of London&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Popular narrative history at its best, well researched, imaginatively and dramatically written. . . . The author marshals his story and his mass of contemporary quotations with great skill.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The brilliance of its narrative chapters . . . a marvelous eye for evocative detail. Hanson&#39;s prose is animated by the ferocious energy of the fire and seems to be guided by its inexorable movement. He creates the literary equivalent of the special effects in a disaster movie. . . . A rich mixture of imagination and research.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-&lt;i&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt; (London)&lt;p&gt;&quot;He writes with knowledge and verve. As if making a television documentary on a natural disaster, he includes a gripping technical chapter on the mechanism and chemistry of combustion. This works brilliantly. . . . The book gains immeasurably from the author&#39;s eye for detail and from his understanding of the beliefs and prejudices of the day. . . . Informative and lively account.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-&lt;i&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; (London)&lt;p&gt;&quot;The best depiction of the Great Fire seen to date. . . .

It&#39;s the flair with which Hanson invests his account with qualities usually reserved for novels-narrative drive, persuasive character sketches, vivid scene stealing.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Sunday Star Times&lt;/i&gt; (New Zealand)" />
