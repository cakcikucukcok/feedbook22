  <title>Senator Sam Ervin, Last of the Founding Fathers - Karl E. Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many Americans remember Senator Sam Ervin (1896-1985) as the affable, Bible-quoting, old country lawyer who chaired the Senate Watergate hearings in 1973. Ervin&#39;s stories from down home in North Carolina, his reciting literary passages ranging from Shakespeare to Aesop&#39;s fables, and his earnest lectures in defense of civil liberties and constitutional government contributed to the downfall of President Nixon and earned Senator Ervin a reputation as &quot;the last of the founding fathers.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet for most of his twenty years in the Senate, Ervin applied these same rhetorical devices to a very different purpose. Between 1954 and 1974, he was Jim Crow&#39;s most talented legal defender as the South&#39;s constitutional expert during the congressional debates on civil rights. The paradox of the senator&#39;s opposition to civil rights and defense of civil liberties lies at the heart of this biography of Sam Ervin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on newly opened archival material, Karl Campbell illuminates the character of the man and the historical forces that shaped him. The senator&#39;s distrust of centralized power, Campbell argues, helps explain his ironic reputation as a foe of civil rights and a champion of civil liberties. Campbell demonstrates that the Watergate scandal represented the culmination of an escalating series of clashes between the imperial presidency of Richard Nixon and a congressional counterattack led by Senator Ervin. The issue central to that struggle, as well as to many of the other crusades in Ervin&#39;s life, remains a key question of the American experience today--how to exercise legitimate government power while protecting essential individual freedoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
