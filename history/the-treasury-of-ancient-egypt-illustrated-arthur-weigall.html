  <title>The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (Illustrated) - Arthur Weigall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No person who has travelled in Egypt will require to be told that it is&lt;br /&gt;
a country in which a considerable amount of waiting and waste of&lt;br /&gt;
time has to be endured. One makes an excursion by train to see some&lt;br /&gt;
ruins, and, upon returning to the station, the train is found to be late,&lt;br /&gt;
and an hour or more has to be dawdled away. Crossing the Nile in a&lt;br /&gt;
rowing-boat the sailors contrive in one way or another to prolong the&lt;br /&gt;
journey to a length of half an hour or more. The excursion steamer&lt;br /&gt;
will run upon a sandbank, and will there remain fast for a part of the&lt;br /&gt;
day.&lt;br /&gt;
The resident official, travelling from place to place, spends a great&lt;br /&gt;
deal of time seated in railway stations or on the banks of the Nile,&lt;br /&gt;
waiting for his train or his boat to arrive; and he has, therefore, a&lt;br /&gt;
great deal of time for thinking. I often try to fill in these dreary&lt;br /&gt;
periods by jotting down a few notes on some matter which has&lt;br /&gt;
recently been discussed, or registering and elaborating arguments&lt;br /&gt;
which have chanced lately to come into the thoughts. These notes are&lt;br /&gt;
shaped and &amp;ldquo;written up&amp;rdquo; when next there is a spare hour, and a few&lt;br /&gt;
books to refer to; and ultimately they take the form of articles or&lt;br /&gt;
papers, some of which find their way into print.&lt;br /&gt;
This volume contains twelve chapters, written at various times and&lt;br /&gt;
in various places, each dealing with some subject drawn from the&lt;br /&gt;
great treasury of Ancient Egypt. Some of the chapters have appeared&lt;br /&gt;
as articles in magazines. Chapters iv., v., and viii. were published in&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Blackwood&amp;rsquo;s Magazine&amp;rsquo;; chapter vii. in &amp;lsquo;Putnam&amp;rsquo;s Magazine&amp;rsquo; and the&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Pall Mall Magazine&amp;rsquo;; and chapter ix. in the &amp;lsquo;Century Magazine.&amp;rsquo; I&lt;br /&gt;
have to thank the editors for allowing me to reprint them here. The&lt;br /&gt;
remaining seven chapters have been written specially for this&lt;br /&gt;
volume.&lt;br /&gt;
