  <title>Interpreting Herodotus - Thomas Harrison, Elizabeth Irwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charles W. Fornara&#39;s Herodotus: An Interpretative Essay (Oxford, 1971) was a landmark publication in the study of the great Greek historian. Well-known in particular for its main thesis that the Histories should be read against the background of the Atheno-Peloponnesian Wars during which it was written, its insight and penetrating discussion extend to a range of other issues, from the relative unity of Herodotus&#39; work and the relationship between
his ethnographies and historical narrative, to the themes and motifs that criss-cross the Histories and how &#39;history became moral and Herodotus didactic&#39;.
Interpreting Herodotus brings together a team of leading Herodotean scholars to look afresh at the themes of Fornara&#39;s seminal Essay in the light of the explosion of scholarship on the Histories in the intervening years, focusing particularly on how we can interpret Herodotus&#39; work in terms of the context in which he wrote. What does it mean to talk of the unity of the Histories, or Herodotus&#39; &#39;moral&#39; purpose?  How can we reconstruct the context in which the
Histories were written and published?  And in what sense might the Histories constitute a &#39;warning&#39; for his own, or for subsequent, generations? In developing and interrogating Fornara&#39;s influential ideas for a new generation of scholars, the volume not only asserts their enduring value to scholarship, but also offers a wealth of
insights and new perspectives on the &#39;Father of History&#39; that attests to the vibrancy and diversity of contemporary engagement with Herodotus." />
