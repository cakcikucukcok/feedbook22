  <title>Historic Photos of University of Alabama Football - Joseph Woodruff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1992, the centennial year of the University of Alabama football program, the Crimson Tide won its 12th national championship. Few major college football programs can claim as many. Through the medium of photography, this book tells the story of the greatness of University of Alabama football, from its origins as a club sport in 1892, through the death of its most famous head coach, Paul W. Bryant. Over the course of those nine decades, Alabama would win 11 of its 12 national championships and forever change the face of college football. What began as a sport dominated by elite teams in the Northeast and Midwest, would, by the time of Bryant’s death, be the hallmark sport of the American South. And the University of Alabama would, for many of those years, be the premier team in one of America’s greatest football conferences, the Southeast Conference. Historic Photos of University of Alabama Football provides a window into a storied past that is the foundation upon which the program’s future greatness will stand." />
