  <title>Hero Tales from History - Smith Burnham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="NEARLY three thousand years ago a bright, handsome Hebrew lad was playing a harp while watching his father&amp;rsquo;s sheep on the hills of Bethlehem. One dark night there was a great stir among the sheep, and David saw a bear making off with one of the lambs. There were no guns in those days, but David had a sling, and he could fling a pebble almost as swift and straight as a boy can shoot a bullet to-day. So David ran and killed the bear by driving a stone through the big brute&amp;rsquo;s eye into its brain. When he took the trembling lamb back to its mother, what should he see but a lion starting off with a sheep in his huge jaws. There was no time to gather pebbles. Grabbing a jagged rock in one hand, David seized the great beast by the mane with the other, and aimed quick blows at the lion&amp;rsquo;s eyes, breaking his skull before the lion could drop his prey and fight back.&lt;br /&gt;
That was a great night&amp;rsquo;s work for one lone lad. After quieting his frightened flock, David took his harp and made up a song of thanks to the God of Israel for saving him alive from the jaws of the lion and the paws of the bear.&lt;br /&gt;
Not long after this, David&amp;rsquo;s old father sent out to the hills for him. When the youth came down to the house, he found Samuel, Prophet of God and Judge of Israel, waiting for him. David&amp;rsquo;s seven older brothers stood around eyeing him strangely, as the prophet said, &amp;ldquo;This is he,&amp;rdquo; and baptized him by pouring oil on his head..." />
