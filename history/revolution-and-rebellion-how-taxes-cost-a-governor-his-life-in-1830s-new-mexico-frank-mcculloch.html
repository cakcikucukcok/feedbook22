  <title>Revolution and Rebellion: How Taxes Cost A Governor His Life In 1830s New Mexico - Frank McCulloch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The year is 1835, the place New Mexico, the hero or villain, depending upon your view is Don Albino Perez. Perez, the newly appointed Mexican governor, is more of an idealist than a politician. He rides north with high hopes for his new office in a strange land. After reaching New Mexico and assuming his duties, Perez finds he has a strong and forceful opponent in the former governor, Don Manuel Armijo. Armijo, who enjoys popular support, is determined to sabotage all of Perez&#39;s programs. His big opportunity comes when Perez puts into effect a vast taxation plan that touches everybody&#39;s pocketbooks. Feelings run high and Armijo seizes the moment to act. Perez is captured and beheaded. His short two-year chapter in New Mexico history with its political turmoil and intrigue is ended. FRANK McCULLOCH, well-known writer of New Mexico history, did extensive research on this fascinating era in New Mexico. He was also fortunate to obtain firsthand accounts of the events from the granddaughter of Don Albino Perez." />
