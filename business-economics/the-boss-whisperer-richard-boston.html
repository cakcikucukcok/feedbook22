  <title>The Boss Whisperer - Richard Boston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Richard Boston is a psychologist and executive coach specialising in leadership and team performance. He has worked closely with hundreds of leaders, middle-managers and teams in a wide range of organisations across six continents. In this highly practical, thought-provoking book, he offers 10 lessons he&amp;rsquo;s learned in the course of his work that will help you get the most from your relationships with the people who lead you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;ve just one boss or you&amp;rsquo;re working in a matrix with multiple senior stakeholders, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the book full of tips, tools and challenging questions to help you &lt;em&gt;and your boss&lt;/em&gt; get the most from what is one of the most important relationships in your working life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also a book that&amp;rsquo;ll get leaders thinking differently about the way they lead. They&amp;rsquo;ll want to share it with their teams, because this isn&amp;rsquo;t a book about tricking your boss into making life easy for you. It&amp;rsquo;s about managing up for mutual gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An incredibly useful and accessible book that has transformed my thinking and approach to both managing upwards and leading my team. As a leader, it&amp;rsquo;s crystal clear to me that the relationships I have with my team are critical to the success of the work we do together. The ten &amp;lsquo;lessons&amp;rsquo; described in this book offer us a way of examining and discussing those relationships to set us all up for success. It&amp;rsquo;s a book I know I&amp;rsquo;ll read and refer to more than once and the author makes that easy: there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to reflect on and the way the The Boss Whisperer is written is like having him in the room with you.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Simon Haskey, Consulting Practice Lead at Dell EMC &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An insightful, enjoyable book that offers the kind of instant payback that&amp;rsquo;s critical to anyone working in a fast-growing, entrepreneurial business. It challenged me to look closely at myself, how I operate and how that plays out with others. In doing so, I discovered that &amp;ndash; despite my best intentions &amp;ndash; sometimes my attempts to help others aren&amp;rsquo;t actually that helpful. This deepened my understanding of my relationship with my boss and ways to further improve it. It also enabled me to adapt my approach to leading others.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Michael Borthwick, Group Financial Controller at Claranet &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Richard Boston has nailed it. If only I&amp;rsquo;d known this earlier in my career, I&amp;rsquo;d have saved myself a lot of grief, done a much better job, and had a happier boss! With so many books for leaders and so few for those they lead, this will be invaluable for anyone in their first or second job, as well as for those in middle management looking to enhance their relationships upwards.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Peter Young, Director and executive coach at Bladon Leadership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
