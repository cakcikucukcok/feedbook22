  <title>Unknown Transactions - Kelechi Ononuju</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unknown Transactions: avoiding scams through understanding, analyze scams as businesses with processes, and understanding these processes as the best education in avoiding scams. It present a new perspective in avoiding scams, by first elaborating on some gaming mechanisms that scammers have employed in deceiving scam targets and which many of us have misunderstood.  The book deals with a wide range of topics, including how scams get introduced to eventual victims, types of scams, different scam proposal responses, and different types of payments a scam victim can make to the scammer. The investigation also examines the role of commitment in making scams successful, the relationship between the scammers confidentiality requests and occultism, and how best scam victims can present their case for a proper prosecution of these elusive culprits, considering the legalities and illegalities involved. Overall, the author identifies salient features of scam businesses, in comparison to genuine business features, exposing the sophistication of scammers in eliciting an advance payment from their unsuspecting victims. The author believes the present and future globalization will be beneficial to mankind, but the inability to delineate and define accurately what participating parties say and claim in business transactions, might be one obstacle to overcome." />
