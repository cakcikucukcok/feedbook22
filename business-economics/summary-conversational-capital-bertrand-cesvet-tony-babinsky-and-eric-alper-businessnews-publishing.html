  <title>Summary: Conversational Capital - Bertrand Cesvet, Tony Babinsky and Eric Alper - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “CONVERSATIONAL CAPITAL: How to Create Stuff People Love to Talk About” by Bertrand Cesvet, Tony Babinski and Eric Alper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bertrand Cesvet is chairman and Chief Strategist of SID LEE, a Montreal-based creative services firm specializing in experiential design. He works with clients such as Adidas, Red Bull and Cirque du Soleil to help them develop and enhance their customer experience projects. Tony Babinski is a Montreal-based writer, creative director and filmmaker. Eric Alper serves as lead strategist for SID LEE projects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conversational capital is about injecting intensity into ordinary products and services to turn them into experiences consumers love and rave about to others. When consumers are so enamored of what you have to offer they make you an ongoing part of their own stories, tremendous things can happen. This is especially true in modern media markets where mass communication is losing its effectiveness. Consumers respond far better to the horizontal (peer to peer) messages or those which bubble from the “bottom up”. These messages are considered far more genuine and therefore more authoritative than paid advertising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this powerful book, the authors argue that the conversational capital should be the Holy Grail for any business which aspires to leadership." />
