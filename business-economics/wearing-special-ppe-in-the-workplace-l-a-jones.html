  <title>Wearing Special “Ppe” in the Workplace - L. A. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote this book of wonderful wisdom on workplace safety for three primary reasons:
1.	The complete furnishing of personal-protection principles and practices
2.	The common work of the workplace
3.	The complex instruction of groups of workers in the workplace
These three primary reasons (as I strongly believe) serve as real keys to achieving the noble goal of a safe workplace:
	To unite workers in the belief that they can be safe
	To unite workers in the wisdom of workplace safety
	To bring workers to a mature state of complete oneness in purpose
	To bring workers to the point of being wise workers
Though the wonderful wisdom of this book reserves the real potential to become universal, it is primarily targeted at steel millssome of the most dangerous places in the world, to work. I firmly believe wisdom of workplace safety is the Master Key to producing wise workers. Wise workers are the first principle to being safe workers. Safe workers are the secret to a safe workplace. A safe workplace is, without a doubt, the noblest of goals that can be set and striven toward by any steel mill.
