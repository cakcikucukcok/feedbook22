  <title>Is it That Time Already? - Rikki Fulton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Rikki Fulton was one of the biggest stars Scotland has produced. From classic comedy performances in Francie and Josie and Scotch &amp;amp; Wry &amp;amp;#150; including the legendary Rev I M Jolly &amp;amp;#150; and appearances in Hollywood movies like Gorky Park, Rikki had an extraordinary life and career. Now, to celebrate his life and work ten years after his passing, this new edition of Is It That Time Already? tells the full story &amp;amp;#150; from Rikki&amp;amp;#8217;s childhood in Glasgow in the 1930s to his experiences in the Royal Navy during the Second World War and his rise to stardom. Rikki includes the remarkable story of how he survived his ship being torpedoed during the war and how he fulfilled his showbiz dreams when the war ended, as he became one of the funniest performers and the biggest stars of his generation with a career dedicated to making people laugh. Packed full of anecdotes, and with a new afterword by Rikki&amp;amp;#8217;s friend and colleague Tony Roper, Is It That Time Already? is a brilliant autobiography by a much-loved and missed entertainer.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
