  <title>How High Will You Climb? - John C. Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;How high will you climb? John Maxwell says it all depends on your attitude.&lt;/B&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Nose up or nose down? Just as the angle of an airplane determines its altitude, so does the approach we take—to family, to work, to life in general—determine the attitude we present the world. The way we solve a problem is often secondary to the approach we take in facing the problem, our outward expression every bit as critical as the inward struggle. When the skies above appear stormy, how will you steer that internal plane we call attitude?&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;With &lt;I&gt;How High Will You Climb?&lt;/I&gt;, author John Maxwell presents detailed lessons on the single invaluable quality that has become a person’s primary force toward success. As the world around us delivers challenges—all the while marching on at its own inevitable pace—the attitude we choose affects each of us individually. And yes, an attitude can be chosen. Attitude is easy in times of joy and progress. But how do you handle the failures sure to interrupt the attainment of goals? What happens to us is often quite different from what happens &lt;I&gt;in&lt;/I&gt; us.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Calling the Bible a “handbook on attitude performance,” Maxwell emphasizes we are never actually flying solo. God supports our approach to problem solving and helps steer the attitude adjustments necessary to think correctly in a sometimes negative world. With a study guide to help evaluate and build upon your own flight angle, &lt;I&gt;How High Will You Climb? &lt;/I&gt;establishes the fundamental elements for a steady, durable flight of life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
