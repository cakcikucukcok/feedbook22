      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledged as the nation&amp;rsquo;s foremost expert on audience development involving America&amp;rsquo;s growing multicultural population by the Arts and Business Council, Donna Walker-Kuhne has now written the first book describing her strategies and methods to engage diverse communities as participants for arts and culture. By offering strategic collaborations and efforts to develop and sustain nontraditional audiences, this book will directly impact the stability and future of America&amp;rsquo;s cultural and artistic landscape.

This book is a practical and inspirational guide on ways to invite, engage and partner with culturally diverse communities, and how to enfranchise those communities into the fabric of arts and culture in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donna Walker-Kuhne&lt;/b&gt; is the president of Walker International Communications Group. From 1993 to 2002, she served as the marketing director for the Public Theater in New York, where she originated a range of audience-development activities for children, students and adults throughout New York City.
