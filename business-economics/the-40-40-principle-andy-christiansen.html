  <title>The 40:40 Principle - Andy Christiansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do NBA superstar Steph Curry, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and Facebooks CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have in common? They all found out that ultimate success comes through the power of relationships. By themselves they were limited, but by adding mentors to their lives and enterprises they were unlimited!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentoring is the new human hack, like spark notes for your life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of your journey this way, when youre in your 20s and 30s intentionally seek out mentors over 40 who can help you dream, gain confidence and think through life altering decisions. Then when youre in your 40s and 50s do the same in reverse, pursue mentors under 40 in order to stay socially relevant, industry knowledgeable and physically fit.  Mentors help you pinpoint ideal paths to pursue in life and work. The 40:40 Principle gives you the roadmap to finding life-changing mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentoring with The 40:40 Principle is needed now more than ever because most people underestimate how the seasons of their lives can dramatically influence their success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Steve Stagner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board, Mattress Firm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a myriad of wealth within the pages of this book. The challenge that faces us all is whether we can continue to settle for sameness. Andy encourages us all to tap into the unmined resources of people so that we can tip the scales of wisdom and experience in favor of fulfilling our purpose while at the same time living a richer and joyous life.&lt;/p&gt;
