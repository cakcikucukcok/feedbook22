  <title>Samurai Sales - Jason Griffiths</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jin arrives in the land of opportunity, learning to master the art of sales while reflecting on martial arts philosophies of his youth.
Join the founder of Europes largest sales consulting agency, the European Health and Sports Community Association as he shares proven strategies on understanding and becoming the better salesperson.
Learn how to:
master key steps in the sales process;
bring an intimate, personal touch to selling; and
avoid the mistakes that prevent big sales.
And do so while enjoying:
Jins tale (based on the experiences of the author while he travelled over a period of thirteen years throughout Europe to become an authority on the subject), as it takes on hilarious proportions - sometimes satirical, sometimes empirical, but always with an eye toward learning how to sell intuitively and instinctively.
When not doing charity work for Cystic Fibrosis or the HERO projects in Alabama, Jason leads an authentically transparent life designed to inspire transformation in others. A native of North Vancouver, British Columbia, CEO of MG Holdings and Canadian-British citizen, Jason Griffiths has set the sales foundations for several multi-billion-dollar companies. After attending Red Deer College and the University of British Columbia, he moved to to Europe to help tens of thousands of individuals world wide learn how to sell professionally.
Those teachings are available here - in Samurai Sales.
There are a lot of books out there that teach sales in a mundane, dry step-by-step method. However, as human beings we lean from story telling and so it is that I wrote the story of blackbelt salesmanship - Jason Griffiths" />
