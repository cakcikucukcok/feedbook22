  <title>Change Your Day, Not Your Life - Andy Core</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Increase your employees&#39;—and your own—productivity at work&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you look out over today&#39;s workforce, you&#39;ll find millions of hard-working people who are overly tired, overly stressed, and less than enchanted with work. For organizations around the globe, this represents an incredible opportunity to improve productivity, talent retention, innovation, and overall profitability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The great paradox here is that when you take hard-working, responsible adults with a desire to succeed and a sense of responsibility and drop them into our demanding work culture, they tend to default to a way of life that sabotages their ability and best efforts to reach their goals. That&#39;s where author Andy Core comes in. &lt;i&gt;Change Your Day, Not Your Life&lt;/i&gt; offers a proven strategy to help you become energized at work. This book is designed as a resource for work-life balance, a tool to help you increase productivity during the final two hours of work by up to 47 percent, content to fuel employee communication, and a curriculum that departments can use in weekly or monthly meetings to keep everyone working at their best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Author Andy Core is a credentialed, award-winning thought leader on increasing employee engagement, productivity, and wellness motivation; his talent lies in helping hard-working, conscientious adults thrive at work and in their personal lives&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turn wasted hours into tasks accomplished by following the methods found in &lt;i&gt;Change Your Day, Not Your Life&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
