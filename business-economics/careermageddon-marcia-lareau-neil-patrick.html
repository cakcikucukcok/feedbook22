  <title>Careermageddon - Marcia LaReau, Neil Patrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Career Survival Guide for the 21st Century:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most people today need one thing more than anything else to survive. A job. Yet world events are conspiring to make good, well-paying jobs scarcer and harder to retain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no-one bothered to tell people about these new threats to their careers. Or what to do about them. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a job today, you need a plan for when you no longer have it. If you are looking for a job today, this book will show you how to get it, and more importantly how to sustain a career which isn&amp;rsquo;t at the mercy of an uncertain economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reactions to Careermageddon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash; Marcia LaReau and Neil Patrick have nailed it in Careermageddon. Careers have changed forever. They give the reader an in-depth explanation why and 21st century strategies to use in moving their careers forward. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Marc Miller President Career Pivot Austin, TX USA &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Careermagedon is not the average quick fix, self-help, self-improvement paperback. It&amp;rsquo;s more like an action-packed blockbuster thriller for those that want to understand their working life better. Expect to be enlightened! &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;John Hanna, Managing Director, GDP Global Development, London. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Our work environment has changed dramatically. Marcia LaReau and Neil Patrick explain how and why with remarkable insight. You must have a career strategy to keep on earning. And it&amp;rsquo;s not your parents&amp;rsquo; career strategy. These career experts show you how to develop the strategy that fits your needs. We all need help with our careers. Your help is in this book. A great career guide.&lt;br /&gt;
