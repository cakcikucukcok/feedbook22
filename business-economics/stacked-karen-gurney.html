  <title>Stacked - Karen Gurney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My Story and Why This Book is for You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been working in the recruiting industry as an Executive Search Consultant and Career Coach since 2004, but something happened in 2015 that completely changed how I worked, literally overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a client who was an Internet Marketing Manager and was seeking a position in E-commerce, social media marketing, or digital marketing; he could barely get a call for an interview after a year of job hunting. Before I started his job search campaign, I checked his LinkedIn.com profile to make sure it looked good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His LinkedIn profile was absolutely horrifying. His picture was a selfie that looked like a bad mugshot after a night of drinking and a subsequent police interrogation. His profile had too much information that was irrelevant to his goals, his headline was meaningless, and he only had 24 connections. There was no way I could position someone that was supposed to be an expert in digital marketing with this repellent LinkedIn profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My client was absolutely desperate for job. He was a nice guy and a good job candidate with a lot of related experience. I usually just give my clients tips to improve their profile but I knew time was of the essence and I needed to take control of his online image immediately. I got his login for LinkedIn as well as other online job boards and within two hours, I re-aligned everything, got a new professional profile picture, changed all of his online profiles to match his job search goals, and did a campaign to grow his connections over the LinkedIn 500+ connection display threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within 48 hours he had over 300 connections and one job interview. By the end of the week, he had four job interviews and had hit the 500+ connection mark and &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had not applied for a single job! Not one!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the calls he got were from his online profiles. This method is now the core of my career coaching practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is the secret? It is just one phrase: Keyword-stacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you learn how to keyword-stack your profiles in the way that recruiters search, you will get calls too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Will Be Able to Do After This Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
