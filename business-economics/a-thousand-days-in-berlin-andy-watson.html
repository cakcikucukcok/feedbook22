  <title>A Thousand Days in Berlin - andy watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book captures the energy and sense of wonder in early 1990s Berlin as seen by a young property professional who lived and worked in the reunified city.&lt;em&gt; A Thousand Days&lt;/em&gt; recalls how the city&amp;#39;s vibrant history and culture clashed with its traumatic recent past, and how Berliners dealt with the scars left by the Wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is also a story of Berlin&amp;rsquo;s property industry rebuilding from scratch. The author rubs shoulders with pioneering real estate giants reconstructing the built environment of the future capital. Part One, &amp;lsquo;inside Berlin&amp;rsquo;, includes stories of the powerful west Berlin &lt;em&gt;Betonmafia&lt;/em&gt;, a basement full of Stasi telephone taps and a big night out at the Kempinski celebrating a deal with a Russian &amp;lsquo;Import-Export company&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part Two &amp;lsquo;outside Berlin&amp;rsquo;, recalls the broken infrastructure and pollution of the former DDR, the acrid taste of asbestos dust and distinctively sweet smell of brown coal. Travelling in the &amp;lsquo;wild East&amp;rsquo;, the author watches families ordering at a McDonald&amp;rsquo;s for the first time and crowds of onlookers admiring his old Honda Civic as if it were a Ferrari.&amp;nbsp; He describes the oddities of town planning in the former DDR, with colossal smokestacks inside a nature reserve and recalls the experience of explaining supply and demand to suspicious planning officials&amp;nbsp;in eastern Germany. &amp;lsquo;The Real Thing&amp;rsquo; chapter is a tale, now emblematic of those unique times, of Coca-Cola&amp;rsquo;s surge into the former East and the author&amp;rsquo;s small role in that success story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final section, &amp;lsquo;Looking Back&amp;rsquo;, highlights the surprises and contradictions of the city 25 years after the Wall came down, and traces how the new Berlin has evolved to become today&amp;rsquo;s city of choice for real estate investors and for young people to live, work and play.&lt;/p&gt;" />
