  <title>Real Money Answers for Every Woman - Patrice C. Washington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Now widely available, the popular, award-winning, self-published guide to help women get out of debt, rebuild their credit, and fulfill their financial dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrice Washington rationalized her excessive spending. &amp;#8220;I work hard, I deserve this.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I bought it on sale.&amp;#8221; But at twenty-two, the recent college graduate was $18,000 in debt and sinking fast. It was time to take control. Patrice educated herself about finance, adopted a new attitude toward money, and most importantly, adjusted her spending habits. By twenty-five she was debt free&amp;#8212;and used the wisdom she gained to start her own successful real estate and mortgage brokerage&amp;#8212;and by twenty-nine started her own financial counseling business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrice&amp;#8217;s former bad spending habits aren&amp;#8217;t unique, and women find themselves in financial hot water for a host of reasons. Women earn less than men and have to stretch those hard-earned dollars further. They contribute more to caregiving and aging parents, live longer, and many&amp;#8212;including most African American women&amp;#8212;are choosing to stay single.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real Money Answers for Every Woman&lt;/em&gt; teaches you how to take responsibility for your financial future, whether you&amp;#8217;re just starting out or need a fresh start. In a handy Q &amp;#38; A format, it offers relatable and easy to understand and implement advice on everything from managing credit cards, home ownership, and student loans to affordable childcare and even negotiating for a higher salary. Following Patrice&amp;#8217;s practical advice, you&amp;#8217;ll learn to form &amp;#8220;wealthy&amp;#8221; habits, establish an &amp;#8220;opportunity fund,&amp;#8221; stop collecting STUFF that causes debt, and discover the freedom that comes from feeling financially secure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
