  <title>Simple Tax Reform - the New201* Tax System - Publius Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This publication describes the framework for a new US tax system, a tax system that affects the individual taxpayer and the business taxpayer. I call it the NEW  Individual/Business TAX System. I call it that because its new, its about the individuals and businesss obligation to pay a tax, and its from beginning to end a complete system. However, to settle on a name, Ive settled on the NEW201* TAX System. Ill explain the * later. 
I believe that reform of the old tax system, (the often referred to U.S. Tax Code), is not enough even if among its reformed features, it changes or eliminates the aggressive nature of the IRS. 
So I have crafted the NEW201* TAX System to radically change the IRS mission and strip away most of its para-police posture and policies. If adopted, no longer will We the People fear the IRS. 
This book is organized as follows: the foreword is followed by a presentation much like you would find in a conventional classroom or business meeting setting. If youve had enough after the slogging through the presentation, good for you. You can stop then. Youll have the information I want you to have. But Im not going to let you off that easily. Following the presentation is a variety of explanations, opinions and ramblings built around notes associated with each presentation page. 
Well then, if we will no longer fear the IRS after we change over to the NEW201* TAX System, then who will we fear? 
The answer is, as it is, as it always has beenCongress. 
As believers fear God the Almighty, taxpayers will always fear those whom they are forced to sustain." />
