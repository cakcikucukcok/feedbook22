  <title>The Business Textbook - Deborah Shaul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Please realize that, the importance of attaining riches and paramountcy of attaining money exchanges and the vital parts of aggregating treasures and the truer crux, of succeeding at amassing capital and substantially greater monetary worth and the significance of bankrolling financial gains, is all in the preliminary intricacies of building your foundations of your business, or vocational outlet...
The success without the expenditures, of mass amount of monies for advertisements of your product, or services, is the name, or the label, or in the products signature and trade name!!
So, get ready for this very understanding, of my interactively and in the Nationally Acclaimed question, of our centurion unknowns of our question, of What came first the chicken, or the egg and how it pertains to this subject matter?
Because, I know the answer to the historically acclaimed asked question, of the time after time, over and over again, timeless question of what came first, the chicken, or the egg?...
By, the way this question is of the most importance to us, being as you will be seeing, in this very intriguing and very important parts of our studies, about the venue of us, as businessmen, or women, or wholesalers, or any part of doing your livelihood and thereby, your hopefully meaning, or purpose in life and therefore, our blessings in disguise and our presents in the forms of our Social talents...
You see, if I were to be the inspired Creator and I was to be the ingenious businessman, or woman, or virtuoso inventor, or imaginative patent creator, then I would be thinking about the end result and the offshoot, of how to grow and develop my very greater idea into quick monies, as well as for the nearer and futuristically farther Brandings and the creations of many brother, or twin businesses, to accompany my Flagship quality businesses. 
Would, I just create chickens and therefore, the lastabilities are short termed and cook the egg, before it hatches, having Sunny Side up eggs and not, realizing that Southern Fried Chicken was on the menu, too and chickens, will not have existed any more.
Would I, on the other hand, have an egg and therefore, we would have to wait until the egg hatched and then, the waiting time from a little chick to a chicken, whereby, whom would be able to eat the very cute chicken, that you named and fostered, from a tiny fuzzy chicky to a full grown chicken, ready for Southern Fried chicken?
I pray that I will be the one to guide and to transform our businesses, in its structure of any type, or formats of earning a living, or simply implanted in any venue whatsoever, of earnings.
Bless you,
