  <title>The Brand Mapping Strategy: Design, Build, and Accelerate Your Brand - Karen Leland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;A fundamental paradigm shift has occurred in marketing and branding. Today the most successful CEOs, executives, entrepreneurs and enterprises set their sites on developing a long-term platform instead of a short-term strategy that supports and builds buzz for their personal or business brand. That&amp;#8217;s really the key to the new business mindset &amp;#151; the recognition that branding and marketing are an ongoing, steady stream of small efforts, not a series of gigantic pushes. Social media, blogging and other business development activities &amp;#151; both online and off &amp;#151; are about the persistent, ongoing process of building a platform, creating credibility and increasing the number of people that you funnel into your potential client and network pipeline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Converting those people into clients or fans may take a month, a year or two years, but the new mindset leads you to strategies that will keep that pipeline full. In short, you need to start a bunch of small fires to keep your brand burning hot. How can today&amp;#8217;s CEOs, executives and entrepreneurs keep these fires going and powerfully get their messages across, motivate others to action and be authentic &amp;#151; all while simultaneously shepherding initiatives from creation to implementation in high-demand markets?&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;CEO, executive and team branding are key factors that enable effective leaders to achieve peak performance, gain greater influence in their industries and generate increased engagement within their companies. By creating a brand (business or personal) by design instead of default, leaders and companies bring their brand promise into every interaction across the board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A personal, team or business brand is not just a single statement or a clever quip but a multilayered, congruent narrative told across multiple channels &amp;#151; online and off &amp;#151; within the organization and to the business community at large. The power is in knowing how to tell the story.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book will introduce CEOs and executives in Fortune 500 companies and entrepreneurs in SMBs to the SMG Brand Mapping Process&amp;#169;, a process that will&lt;br&gt;guide them in creating personal, team and business brands that work in harmony and parallel with each other.&lt;/div&gt;" />
