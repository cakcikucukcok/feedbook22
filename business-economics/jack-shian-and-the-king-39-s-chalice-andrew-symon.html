  <title>Jack Shian and the King&#39;s Chalice - Andrew Symon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Twelve-year-old Jack Shian has a secret. He belongs to an amazing and powerful group of &amp;amp;#145;otherworld&amp;amp;#8217; creatures called the Shian, who hold extraordinary powers and inhabit a hidden world underneath Edinburgh Castle. They can be any creature you&amp;amp;#8217;ve ever imagined, and many you haven&amp;amp;#8217;t. And while they have mostly been forgotten by humans, they&amp;amp;#8217;ve been there all along, watching. Now, with the return of the Destiny Stone after hundreds of years, the Shian&amp;amp;#8217;s magycks are growing stronger. And when Jack and his cousins discover that a lost ancient chalice will make the Shian even more powerful, they set out on a journey of a lifetime, determined to find it. But Jack soon finds out that there are others who want this power too, for evil rather than good, and they will stop at nothing to get it. Full of intrigue, secrets, mystery and betrayal, Jack Shian and the King&amp;amp;#8217;s Chalice is the beginning of a magical new adventure.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
