  <title>War in the Boardroom - Al Ries, Laura Ries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renowned business gurus Al and Laura Ries give a blow-by-blow account of the battle between management and marketing&amp;#8212;and argue that the solution lies not in &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; we think but in &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we think&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a reason why the marketing programs of the auto industry, the airline industry, and many other industries are not only ineffective, but bogged down by chaos and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management minds are not on the same wavelength as marketing minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes a good chief executive?

A person who is highly visual, intuitive, and holistic. Typical characteristics of a right brainer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These different mind-sets often result in conflicting approaches to branding, and the Ries&#39; thought-provoking observations&amp;#8212;culled from years on the front lines&amp;#8212;support this conclusion, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Management deals in reality. Marketing deals in perception.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Management demands better products. Marketing demands different products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Management deals in verbal abstractions. Marketing deals in visual hammers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using some of the world&#39;s most famous brands and products to illustrate their argument, the authors convincingly show why some brands succeed (Nokia, Nintendo, and Red Bull) while others decline (Saturn, Sony, and Motorola). In doing so, they sound a clarion call: to survive in today&#39;s media-saturated society, managers must understand how to think like marketers&amp;#8212;and vice versa. Featuring the engaging, no-holds-barred writing that readers have come to expect from Al and Laura Ries, &lt;em&gt;War in the Boardroom&lt;/em&gt; offers a fresh look at a perennial problem and provides a game plan for companies that want to break through the deadlock and start reaping the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;" />
