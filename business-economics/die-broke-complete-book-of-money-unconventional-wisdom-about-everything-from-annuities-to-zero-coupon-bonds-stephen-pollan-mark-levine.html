  <title>Die Broke Complete Book of Money: Unconventional Wisdom About Everything from Annuities to Zero-Coupon Bonds - Stephen Pollan, Mark Levine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;The incredible economic growth of the past few years may have made scores of new millionaires and plenty of people rich, but it hasn&#39;t made managing your personal and business finances any easier.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, most of the old rules and principles have proved ill suited to this new world. What&#39;s needed is a user&#39;s guide to the new economy -- a handbook for everyone looking to succeed in this new, fast-paced environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this single, highly unconventional financial reference volume, America&#39;s most trusted financial consultant and author of the bestselling &lt;em&gt;Die Broke&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Live Rich&lt;/em&gt; takes an aggressive approach to the new economy and tells you everything you need to know about money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Die Broke Complete Book of Money&lt;/em&gt; is the definitive guide to modern money management. The man famous for turning conventional wisdom on its head expounds on the new rules for the new millennium with opinionated, hard-hitting, and informative entries on everything from accessory apartments to zero-coupon bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollan&#39;s clients are grappling with today&#39;s financial challenges -- and his advice is battle tested in the real world. Putting the old rules aside, he sees the worlds of consumerism, career, business, and personal finance as being inseparable -- money has to be considered as a whole unit rather than as different elements. And because he&#39;s a practicing financial adviser who deals with real people, he knows financial decisions shouldn&#39;t be made in a vacuum: emotions, feelings, and attitudes must come into play. By explaining what you should do and how you should do it, Pollan offers advice grounded in a hands-on, real-world approach that is easy to understand and simple to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savvy, sophisticated, and succinct, this incisive and engaging book is filled with offbeat, practical advice that stems from Pollan&#39;s unconventional strategies. It is an indispensable guide to money for anyone who plans on succeeding in the new economy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
