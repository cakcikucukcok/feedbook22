  <title>Corporate America Needs Neuroscience Expanded Edition - Terrence Bruce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One thing that all people have in common are neurotransmitters that fire in effort to increase our odds of survival. This holds true no matter your position and job title. We will discuss the 5 main neurotransmitters that can have a significant impact on employee engagement in a good and/or bad way. There are 4 neurotransmitters that are chiefly responsible for making us feel good. There is 1 neurotransmitter that is chiefly responsible for making us feel not so good. The 4 neurotransmitters responsible for positive emotions are Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins. In this book, I will briefly explain what each of the 5 neurotransmitters do and why they are important. I will also point out the things I feel Corporate America is currently doing wrong that promotes the release of Cortisol versus the release of any of the 4 Happy Chemicals. I will then offer up what changes should be made to foster a much healthier, happier and more productive working environment" />
