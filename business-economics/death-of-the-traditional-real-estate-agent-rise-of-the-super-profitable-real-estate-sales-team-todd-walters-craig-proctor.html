  <title>Death of the Traditional Real Estate Agent: Rise of the Super-Profitable Real Estate Sales Team - Todd Walters, Craig Proctor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Weve all heard the stats and stories about how tough it is to make a profitable living in real estate without high (and often devastating) lifestyle costs, but what do you know about the super successful agents, those netting $500,000, $1 million, $3 million, or more a year selling real estate? What do you really know about how they think, what they do, and how they approach the business, most often rejecting the industry norms that enslave the average agent? The fact of the matter is, if your real estate business depends on you, you dont really have a businessyou have a job. In stark contrast, these mega agents have true businesses built on turnkey systems and well-organized teams. There is no stopping this trend. More and more teams will come, garner more market share, and get paid premium fees at the same time working less and playing more than the typical agent. Inside these pages, well introduce you to sixteen of these super successful, highly profitable real estate team leaders who share the secrets of their rise to the top 1 percent of the entire industry, how they did it, and how you can copy your way to your own megasuccessful real estate business." />
