  <title>The Pep Talk - Kevin Elko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Coach Jack Morris was at a complete loss. One week after being hung in effigy for leading the beloved Lincoln Lions to their twenty-fourth straight defeat, Morris was bracing for the Jacktown Giants. Gians by name and by record, they were heralded as the best prep team Ohio had ever seen. Coach Morris was just waiting for the axe to fall.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;But something bizarre happened when a stranger requested permission to deliver the pregame pep talk. With nothing to lose, Coach Morris agreed. No one could have predicted the result: A motivated team, fighting for pride, fighting for their town, fighting for each other.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Though just a fictional football story, &lt;I&gt;The Pep Talk&lt;/I&gt; contains universal and inspirational words of truth that apply to every walk of life. Author Kevin Elko makes a living giving the same talk contained in these pages to corporations and athletic teams around the country. Like the characters in this story, Elko&#39;s pep talks have changed lives and helped drive teams to national and world championship victories.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Empower yourself for success. Empower yourself with &lt;I&gt;The Pep Talk&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;" />
