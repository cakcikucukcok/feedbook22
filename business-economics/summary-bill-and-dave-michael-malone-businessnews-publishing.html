      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;BILL &amp;amp; DAVE: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World’s Greatest Company&quot; by Michael Malone.&lt;br&gt;Michael Malone is a technology journalist. He is the former editor of Forbes ASAP and is currently a Web journalist for ABC. He has also written feature articles which have been published in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Wired and Fast Company magazines. &lt;br&gt;In Bill &amp;amp; Dave, Malone tells the story of how Hewlett and Packard built the world’s greatest company. He starts by explaining their childhood days and their student life. He then covers how they met and started the Hewlett-Packard company in a garage in 1939 when they built their first product, an audio oscillator. It was the start not only of a legendary company but of an entire way of life in Silicon Valley and, ultimately, our modern digital age. &lt;br&gt;The reader will come to know that many of the best practices in management common today especially in IT companies originated from HP.&lt;br&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Dave is a very well written and informative book. A perfect business adventure story for anyone working in IT, as well as a compulsory read for all HP employees." />
