  <title>Best Fiverr Trainer - A. J. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hello my dear reader! This ebook has been updated to include my knowledge and experience from using the new ideas that have given me success for over 8 years on Fiverr.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s my belief that you will derive value for your money if you buy,study and apply the simple step by step stuff that I have written in this ebook - the simple stuff that took me to making about $6000 monthly on Fiverr alone. But first let me introduce myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My name is A. J. Wright. I am an internet marketer and a freelancer. I&amp;#39;ve been doing business online since 2003.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I joined Fiverr.com in 2011 when it was still very much in its infancy. I have experienced failure, success, problems and joy on Fiverr and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m qualified to train you on how you too can succeed on Fiverr and make as much money as you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s nowhere online where you can become a millionaire without putting either some effort or money. I do not believe in the get-rich-quick scheme and so if you can use the ideas discussed in this ebook and put in a few hours of work daily on Fiverr doing the simple things I teach in the book,you will surely succeed like I have done!&lt;br /&gt;
