He is regarded as one of the leading figures in the marketing world. He has sold around 20 million copies worldwide of the 59 books which make up the guerrilla marketing series, making him one of the widest read authors in history. Founder of Save the Mountain and the Business Ethics Pledge movements, Shel Horowitz has had a lifelong involvement in environmental and social change movements. &lt;br&gt;Green, ethical marketing not only feels better but in today’s economy it works better as well.
