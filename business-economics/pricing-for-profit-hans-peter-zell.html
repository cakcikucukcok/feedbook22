  <title>Pricing for Profit - Hans Peter Zell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pricing for Profit: The Managers Guide to Market Oriented Pricing  was written to assist  corporate managers  in realizing the full potential  available  in  the sell price as a companys  primary  revenue and profit generator.  The book is a radical departure from standard texts  in its practical and quantitative approach. Because of its heavy use of formulas, graphs, reference tables, and pricing rules and guidelines, it will appeal primarily to marketers with a  background in the natural sciences or engineering and less so to individuals who prefer a less rigorous treatment of the subject. A special feature of the book is three chapters devoted to price optimization techniques for determining  sell prices of products or  services designed to  achieve  maximum sales revenues or profits for the firm. Numerous examples throughout the text demonstrate use of all pricing formulas and techniques presented.
	Because the book covers all the relevant pricing topics in a logical sequence, with each chapter building on the material of the previous one, Pricing for Profit should also be of considerable interest to academia. In a business school MBA program, for example, it could serve either as the primary text in a course on market oriented pricing or, in a marketing class,  as a pricing supplement to one of the standard marketing  texts. Finally, many business executives and managers who are not normally directly involved in the pricing function could benefit from reading this work for a new perspective on pricing and the many  methods and techniques available to improve the bottom line through proactive, market oriented pricing." />
