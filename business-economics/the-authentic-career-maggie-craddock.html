  <title>The Authentic Career - Maggie Craddock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many people experience some degree of job dissatisfaction. But figuring out whether they should change themselves — or change jobs — isn&#39;t easy. Drawing on her business background, training as a social worker, and years as an executive coach, Maggie Craddock outlines a therapeutic process that carefully separates what the reader wants and needs from the often-frustrating demands of family and work.
The author believes that identifying authentic career goals and strategies requires a careful examination of one&#39;s inner life. She clearly outlines the four-stage process — beginning with the Awareness Stage and ending with the Integration Stage — and includes exercises, examples, and inspirational quotes. Craddock gently guides the reader through the process, illustrating each stage with real-life examples, including stories from Fortune 500 CEOs and professional women returning to the workforce after having children. Ultimately a very hopeful book, The Authentic Career is a welcome companion on anyone’s career path." />
