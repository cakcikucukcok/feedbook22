  <title>Risk &amp; Grow Rich: How to Make Millions in Real Estate - Kendra Todd, Charles Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With her skill in selling real estate, her expertise in marketing, and her drive to succeed, Kendra Todd has mapped out an exciting and lucrative future for herself&amp;#8211;one that included taking the right kind of risks, profiting from them, and sharing her knowledge with others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Todd understands that the one thing that keeps people from making the big, bold moves that can improve their lives is a fear of risk, even more than lack of capital. The willingness to try new and different things, and the ability to keep your head on straight while your heart is pounding, is something that Todd knows well. Without risk, she doesn&#39;t have a business. Todd will address how men and women view risk from opposite sides of the galaxy, how anyone can become an entrepreneur, how you can set yourself up for success and what the ten steps are for turning risk into opportunity. With quizzes to test what kind of risk taker you are, and examples of successful risks that paid off, Todd is poised to become the hot voice of investment to her generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
