  <title>Unwanted Evidence of a Corporate Icon - Ben Strope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book is mostly about one individual who worked for a large company and found himself on the wrong side of the companys management when corruption was discovered and exposed. This took place even though he had worked for and through the companys internal security forces, contracted corporate investigator firms, and the FBI. The book covers all levels and types of industrial crime, but concentrates more on executive crime. This is because it affects society the most, and it falls under the category of near-perfect crimes. This is because few are ever arrested, convicted, or do prison time even though they steal billions from all areas of society. The Wall Street crash was a prime example, and to add insult to injury, most got their bonuses on top of what they stole. This book continually tries to show its readers by example after example how easy it is for executives to steal billions and never even get questioned, forget about being arrested. Our criminal system is just not equipped or concerned about this type of crime. The ultimate concept being, crime in the executive world really pays big.&lt;/p&gt;" />
