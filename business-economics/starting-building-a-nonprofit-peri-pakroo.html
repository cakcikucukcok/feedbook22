It will offer the latest information on social media best practices, trends in crowdfunding, email outreach strategy and more. The new edition will also provide updates on alternative legal structures such as benefit corporations, including recent state adoptions. It will also offer the latest strategies for using systems and technology to manage operations, such as managing donor or member lists, staff, and finances." />
