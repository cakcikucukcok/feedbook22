  <title>Common Sense Business: Managing Your Small Company - Steve Gottry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you own or plan to own a small business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you work for a small business and desire to better understand your boss? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you know someone who owns a business and wants to be stronger, more focused, and more successful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that many business books offer a lot of wonderful sounding theories, but they have little practical application in the real world of small business. &lt;em&gt;Common Sense Business&lt;/em&gt; is full of life-and-death ideas. Follow Steve Gottry&#39;s advice and your business will live and thrive. Ignore it and your business could founder or die. Benefit from Gottry&#39;s experience as an entrepreneur who grew a hugely successful media agency, experienced a harrowing business failure, then rebounded with a new business and a fresh start on life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Sense Business&lt;/em&gt; tells you how to succeed throughout every phase of the small business life cycle -- from starting to operating, growing, and even closing down a business. No matter the state of the economy or the maturity of your business, you will find winning solutions to the questions and situations you face every day. Steve Gottry will help you understand yourself; your employees, customers, and vendors; and how people come together to form a successful business. You will learn how to maximize your business&#39;s assets and how to ward off those threats that could eat away at your resources and peace of mind, including debt, sloppiness, addiction, and fear. Warm, honest, funny, and factual, entrepreneur Steve Gottry tells the whole truth about successfully managing a business through good times and bad.&lt;/p&gt;" />
