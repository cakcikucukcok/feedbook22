  <title>Agile Innovation - Langdon Morris, Moses Ma, Po Chi Wu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Find your company&#39;s unique innovation style, and nurture it into a powerful competitive advantage&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Praised by business leaders worldwide, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Agile Innovation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the authoritative guide to survival and success in today&#39;s &quot;innovate-or-die&quot; business world. This revolutionary approach combines the best of Agile with the world&#39;s leading methods of Innovation to present a crisp, articulate, and proven system for developing the breakthrough capabilities every organization must master to thrive today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You already know that effective innovation doesn&#39;t happen by accident—it is achieved by careful design. Agile Innovation addresses the three critical drivers of innovation success: accelerating the innovation process; reducing the risks inherent in innovation; and engaging your entire organization and your broader ecosystem in the innovation effort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The key frameworks described here build on the proven success of Agile to provide a comprehensive and customizable Innovation Master Plan approach to sustained innovation improvement in the five critical performance areas: strategy, portfolio, process, culture and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Major topics include: the power of Agile in the innovation process, how to overcome innovation risk, the best tools to evoke engagement and collaboration, branding as an integral element of innovation, and the best leadership skills and practices that create the special environment that enables transformative growth. Readers will learn specifically how to create better ideas, develop them more efficiently, and work together more profitably and effectively to achieve breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The insights offered in this book are highlighted in 11 detailed case studies illustrating the world&#39;s best innovation practices at Wells Fargo, Nike, Volvo, Netflix, Southwest Airlines, NASA,&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, and others, in dozens of specific business examples, in two dozen powerful and unique techniques and methods, and a full set of implementation guidelines to put these insights into practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key Insights:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Understand how to implement the many ways that innovation efforts can be accelerated to achieve even greater competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn to create a culture of innovation, greater engagement, and rich collaboration throughout your organization&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover how to reduce risk and accelerate learning&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Implement your own unique plan to enhance collaborative innovation, from leadership through operations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Integrate key agility principles into your strategic planning decisions for sustained improvement&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explore dramatic new approaches to open innovation that optimize large scale innovation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Apply the latest and best technology tools to enhance innovation, reduce risk, and promote broad participation.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a must read book, a practical guide for fostering a culture of innovation, nurturing creativity, and efficiently developing the ideas that drive strategic growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And since innovation is not imitation, you know that copying the ideas and strategies of other successful organizations will not produce the desired outcomes. Hence, all leaders must develop their own way of innovating and nurture the right style of collaborating for their own organization. This book will guide you to find your own unique pathways to success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blaze your own trail to the high levels of innovativeness and organizational agility by learning from the expert guidance and practical, actionable advice offered throughout this important book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
