  <title>I Sold My House In a Raffle: A Proven Step-by-step Method to Get Your Asking Price, Save Money, Save Time, &amp; Help a Charity too! - Diane Giraudo McDermott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you&#39;re a home seller wishing to skip the conventional process of listing your home and waiting for a qualified buyer, and you&#39;ve always wanted to be &quot;rich enough&quot; to help your favorite charity in a big way, your time has come. I Sold My House in a Raffle explains the entire process for homeowners, realtors, and also for the nonprofit director who is open to an innovative fundraising alternative that can provide a sizeable chunk of cash to support the charity. Diane Giraudo McDermott, an advocate of animal rights, couldn&#39;t match the incentives building developers were offering home buyers, and buyers interested in her property couldn&#39;t qualify for a loan; so she used her marketing background and partnered with a &quot;no-kill&quot; animal shelter and successfully sold her house in a raffle. Inside, you&#39;ll learn how to utilize the best marketing techniques, create a winning raffle formula, complete the required paperwork, connect with the right charity, and reduce your risk. Take charge of your real estate future--save thousands of dollars, save time waiting for that qualified buyer, and get your full asking price!  This is a method whose time has come, and it can work for you too." />
