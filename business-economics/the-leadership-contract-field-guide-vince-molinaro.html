  <title>The Leadership Contract Field Guide - Vince Molinaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commit to great leadership and implement it today&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Leadership Contract Field Guide&lt;/i&gt; provides a practical blueprint for implementing the Leadership Contract. Reading is one thing, but new ideas cannot be useful until they are put into practice—so now it is time to commit. Review the major tenets of great leadership, internalize them, and look around at your organization; what does your organization currently need the most? Where is the clear deficit? What do your people most need &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt; to work to their full potential? That’s where you start. Decisions? Make them. Obligations? Fulfill them. Hard work? Toughen up. Leadership is a privilege and a responsibility, and this book shows you how to move from &lt;i&gt;conceptualizing&lt;/i&gt; “great leadership” into &lt;i&gt;practicing&lt;/i&gt; great leadership—starting today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This guide summarizes what you learned in &lt;i&gt;The Leadership Contract&lt;/i&gt;, and integrates that knowledge into real-world actions that make you more effective, while new discussion on accountability draws from research and case studies from major organizations to give you fresh perspective and valuable insight. The result is a clear roadmap to high performance, and you’re standing on the starting line—are you ready to go?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Review the key points of what it means to lead&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Focus on accountability and fulfilling obligations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identify and accommodate organizational needs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Implement the Contract to become a more effective leader&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your employees are your biggest, most valuable asset, and you should be theirs. You need to equip them to succeed, motivate them to achieve, and inspire them to new heights with each and every interaction. In word and in deed, you must walk the walk every single day. This is what great leadership looks like, and it is already inside of you. &lt;i&gt;The Leadership Contract Field Guide&lt;/i&gt; gives you a systematic blueprint for unleashing your very best and achieving so much more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
