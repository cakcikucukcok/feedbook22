  <title>The Co-Creation Paradigm - Venkat Ramaswamy, Kerimcan Ozcan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A fundamental shift is underway that will change how we conceive of value. In an era of increasing interconnectedness, individuals, as opposed to institutions, stand at the center of value creation. To adapt to this tectonic shift, organizations can no longer unilaterally devise products and services. They must engage stakeholders—from customers and employees to suppliers, partners, and citizens at large—as co-creators.
Co-creation guru Venkat Ramaswamy and Kerimcan Ozcan call for enterprises to be mindful of lived experiences, to build engagement platforms and management systems that are designed for creative collaboration, and to develop &quot;win more-win more&quot; strategies that enhance our wealth, welfare, and, well-being. Richly illustrated with examples of co-creation in action, &lt;i&gt;The Co-Creation Paradigm&lt;/i&gt; provides a blueprint for the co-creative enterprise, economy, and society, while presenting a conceptual framework that will guide organizations across sectors in adopting this transformational approach. Challenging some of our most deeply held ideas about business and value, this book outlines the future of &quot;business as usual.&quot;" />
