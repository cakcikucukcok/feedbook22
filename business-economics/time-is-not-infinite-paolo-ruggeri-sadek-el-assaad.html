  <title>Time is not infinite - Paolo Ruggeri, Sadek El Assaad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;In the last decade alone, I have collaborated with many owners, CEOs, Managing Directors and Company Managers who often &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;worked as though their time was infinite. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;I saw them spending more and more time with their team in the office until their week became highly laborious. They would only leave the office to eat and sleep. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to say that we should only work from 9 to 5, 5 days a week and then completely ignore our work on weekends. I know that sometimes we have to put in the extra hours to meet our deadlines and achieve our targets; however, when this becomes the norm, it means that we need to consider alternatives such as working smarter rather than harder. This is the reason why I am writing this book&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dedicated to all Entrepreneurs, Business Owners, CEOs, Managing Directors and Company Managers who think that every working day should be 48 hours, during which the need to eat, sleep and socialize is nonexistent. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To all those who wait for the weekend just to rest...I, too, was one of them so many years back!&lt;/i&gt;" />
