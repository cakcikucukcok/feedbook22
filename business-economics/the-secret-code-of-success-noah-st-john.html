  <title>The Secret Code of Success - Noah St. John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Americans spend more than $11 billion a year on self-help products&amp;#8212;everything from books to diet pills to career coaches to seminars. So why&amp;#8212;with all this time, money, and energy being spent&amp;#8212;are so few people living the life they really want? Why are millions of smart, talented, motivated people still going through life with one foot on the brake? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the real Secret: &lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t need any more how-to-succeed information to reach your full potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem isn&#39;t lack of motivation or lack of information. The real problem is that most people focus on the &quot;how-to&quot; aspects of success taught by traditional self-help programs, without coming to terms with what productivity expert Noah St. John calls your &quot;head trash&quot;&amp;#8212;the subconscious, emotional roadblocks that prevent people from acting on their real hopes, dreams, and ambitions. In this groundbreaking book, based on work with thousands of clients around the world, Noah St. John has created a remarkable, step-by-step approach that helps you achieve long-term happiness, success, and wealth. In &lt;em&gt;The Secret Code of Success&lt;/em&gt;, you will learn how to: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate the causes of self-sabotage and fear of success&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow yourself to make more money&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove stress while dramatically increasing personal productivity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improve relationships with coworkers, family, and friends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience enhanced feelings of happiness, connection, and love&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Secret Code of Success&lt;/em&gt; shows that, when it comes to success, the conscious mind is exactly the wrong place to start. It&#39;s only when we first conquer the self-sabotage of our subconscious (which accounts for 90 percent of our behavior) that we can truly begin to enjoy a life filled with success. This insight is at the core of &lt;em&gt;The Secret Code of Success&lt;/em&gt; and leads to Noah&#39;s revolutionary 7-step method for eliminating these psychological obstacles. True financial freedom and personal success is possible at last!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret Code of Success shows you how to get your foot off the brake and start living the life you deserve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
