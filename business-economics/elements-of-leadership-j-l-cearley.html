  <title>Elements of Leadership - J. L. Cearley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leadership tends to remain an undefined quality to most managers. We see people with leadership abilities and often refer to them as having leadership skills. Yet, in most personnel meetings, leadership is mostly discussed as a singular skill that one either possesses or not. In the process of selecting personnel for advancement in management, the most common approach is to cherry-pick those who look and act most like us, or someone who matches our paradigm of a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book attempts to break down leadership into teachable skill sets that can be practiced and honed to improve your leadership abilities. It is designed in individual elements to allow you to focus on one area at a time for more effective learning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
