  <title>Spotting the Trend: An Entrepreneur&#39;s Success Story - Jenny Chang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Jenny Chang teamed up with her husband and sister to start an Internet security company, she struggled with juggling a new business, family life, and the demands of traveling. But Trend Micro, Inc.- founded in 1988 with $5,000 in seed money-grew into a Nikkei 225 company making more than $1 billion per year in revenue and with operations in more than twenty countries. In this business book/memoir, she looks back at how she and her partners capitalized on the global threat of cyber-crime, turning a fledgling company into an amazing growth story. Chang does much more than just revisit the company&#39;s history: She shares the story of the three founders and their vision, and she reveals all the details behind how they transformed the security industry-and their own lives-in ways they never imagined." />
