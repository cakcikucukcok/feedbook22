  <title>Identifying Business Opportunities: A Guide to Choosing a Suitable Business - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first step to any successful business is to find out about the quality of the business opportunity you are planning to start. You should know what you must look for.    The business should have enough targeted customer base. Now, what do we mean by that? Let&#39;s say you are planning to start a home-based business. You will need to look for a business that is more in demand. Where need is high and supply is less, you can have a better scope of success. Take the example of SEO opportunities for freelancers. You can do this from home without any high investment. In this niche, the requirement on your part is very high and you are bound to do well if you put in the right effort, because the professionals here are fewer. You need such an opportunity.   The business should have a good breakeven point. If your business doesn&#39;t have that, then you need to have large amount of working capital." />
