  <title>The Concise Coaching Handbook - Elizabeth Dickinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Utilizing a ‘coach approach’ with oneself and others enables quicker and more effective progress towards goals.  This book identifies the crucial coaching qualities and actions to increase motivation, engagement, and performance. Through exercises and examples, the author demonstrates how to ask compelling questions, how to create effective action by constructing SMART goals, and how to hold yourself and others accountable. Additionally, she illustrates how presence and attitude, active listening, compelling questions, setting goals and accountabilities, and encouragement and feedback function in a coaching relationship.  Drawing from neuroscience, case studies and personal experience, she shows how to use these specific techniques to create more fulfilling relationships and results. The Concise Coaching Handbook ends with three brief case studies of for-profit and non-profit organizations who have committed to creating a ‘coaching culture’ and the benefits they’ve received." />
