  <title>100 Tips to Small Business Results - Shelly Berman-Rubera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;100 Tips to Small Business Results&quot; is a compilation of ideas pulled from SBR&#39;s 6 Steps to Small Business Results framework. This framework helps small business owners overcome three  of the main issues they face: a sense of isolation, the burden of feeling overwhelmed, and lack of a revenue-generating model.  Structured in an easily digestible format that supports the day to day needs of running a business, the book includes insightful information as well as a process that urges accountability and commitment.  You will find tips, case studies, and short accountability homework assignments to help you commit to yourself and your business success.  In this short, information packed book, you will be inspired, educated and given meaningful ideas to improve your business which can implemented right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this Book?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tip book is unique in that it provides you with a systematic format and process rather than solely information.  Each section has a worksheet with a built-in system of accountability for the reader to identify a tip, make a commitment to their business growth, and then observe and measure the results of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comprehensive game plan is incredibly valuable both to the new entrepreneur as well as the seasoned business owner. Shelly brings her wealth of wisdom and experience in a dynamic program. Tough economic times call for creative and innovative solutions to weather the storm. Shelly has laid out a game plan that allows a small business owner to focus on the important tasks on a day to day basis, to increase market share, promote brand awareness and increase revenues. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to grow or build a business.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;--Paul Pasquarosa, Sales Manager, Safeguard Security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SBR has created a valuable approach to help business owners and entrepreneurs achieve growth. Shellys passion and expertise shine through.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;--Nan Langowitz, Professor, Babson College &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;SBR has been instrumental in helping me get crystal clear on my target market and how to best present my brand.&lt;br /&gt;
