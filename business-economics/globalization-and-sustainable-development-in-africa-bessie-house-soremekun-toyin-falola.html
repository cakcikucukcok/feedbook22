  <title>Globalization and Sustainable Development in Africa - Bessie House-Soremekun, Toyin Falola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Few studies of globalization have analyzed its impact on African societies from the viewpoint of sustainable development. This volume answers that need. The essays here contribute to the store of knowledge about globalization in sub-Saharan Africa by documenting the affect of this global force on the continent&#39;s growth -- economic, political, and cultural. This interdisciplinary collection provides comprehensive analyses at the international, national, and local levels of the theoretical issues revolving around the complex process of globalization, while offering detailed examinations of new models of economic development that can be implemented in sub-Saharan Africa to enhance economic growth, self-sufficiency, and sustainable development. These models are accessible to politicians, public policy analysts, scholars, students, international organizations, nongovernmental actors, and members of the public at large. Finally, the essays here provide insightful case studies of African countries that already demonstrate creative, indigenous-based models of entrepreneurship and discuss efforts to achieve sustainable development and economic independence at the grassroots level. Contributors represent the disciplines of law, history, political science, economics, sociology, anthropology, business and management, African studies and art history, criminal justice, and education.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bessie House-Soremekun is the Public Scholar in African American Studies, Civic Engagement, and Entrepreneurship, Professor of Political Science and Professor of Africana Studies at Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis. Toyin Falola is the Jacob and Frances Sanger Mossiker Chair in the Humanities and University Distinguished Teaching Professor at the University of Texas at Austin." />
