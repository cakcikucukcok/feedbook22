  <title>Capturing Good Stress on the Leadership Battlefield - Steven C. German, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How to remain fresh, focused, creative, productive, and healthy in the face of enormous stress is an important challenge facing leaders within the modern organization, regardless of the organization or the level of leadership. Providing a way to successfully address this challenge is the primary goal of this book. The book recognizes that stress can actually be a positive force for enhancing performance if it is managed effectively, offering an optimistic message for leaders facing ongoing pressures in their work. What Dr. German does in his book is to offer knowledge and practical strategies, based on solid research, to help leaders better manage the distress, or negative stress, inherent in their role. In addition, the book provides tools to develop a personal resiliency enhancement plan to allow leaders better access to the wave of positive energy that comes from experiencing good stress, also called eustress. The information offered in the book is creatively presented as part of a training program involving leaders, making the material an intriguing read as well as an invitation to be part of the learning process shared by others serving in the leadership role." />
