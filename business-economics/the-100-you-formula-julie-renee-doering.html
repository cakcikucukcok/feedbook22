  <title>The 100% You Formula - Julie Renee Doering</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Julie Renee mentors powerful, ambitious leaders who refuse to play small but are being taken out of their game by exhaustion and fuzzy brain.

But I found myself exhausted and rundown, with never enough me time to recharge. I accepted that as how it had to be until I read this amazing book. It taught me how to clear my blocks so I can work smarter, not harder. I have regained my clarity and power and feel ready to relaunch at my true 100 percent. Thank you, Julie Renee!&lt;/p&gt;
