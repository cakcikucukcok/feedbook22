  <title>Just Common Sense - Mark E. Frels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book deals with the authors opinions and experiences regarding fundamental association management techniques for staff. These management techniques are both different from and similar to traditional corporate management techniques. Some of the differences focus on the dynamics of working with both staff and volunteer leaders and understanding the important differences in effectively working with those two groups.
This book includes commentary pertaining to the motivation, supervision, and training of staff as well as the training and encouragement of leaders. It includes a very fundamental look at work habits necessary for the professional association management staff member to be successful. It features very fundamental common sense association management comments and accounts. This information will have been successfully received by the reader if it serves even as an important reminder for daily staff efforts.
The reader will note that communications, in one form or another, is emphasized repeatedly. This is considered of paramount importance to the author and will become increasingly evident as the reader proceeds.
The reader should further note that while the author embraces technology, he also warns that it alone is not the avenue to successful management techniques. The use of various technologies as management tools are, without a doubt, extremely important and offer great opportunity and efficiency; however, other fundamental management tools and practices must be employed along with technology for the association management professional to be successful.
As previously stated, this book contains the opinions and comments of the author exclusively. If those comments stir controversy, cause discussion and debate, or simply remind us as association management staff what is truly important as we strive to excel as association management professionals, then the book has achieved its objectives." />
