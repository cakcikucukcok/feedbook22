  <title>Invite the Bully to Tea - Maureen F Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A POWERFUL WAY TO RESOLVE GROUP CONFLICTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflicts not only wreak havoc on people and relationships but cost millions of dollars in lost productivity, turnover, grievances and legal disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other dispute resolution books, this book teaches a restorative way to resolve group conflict. Rather than punishing &amp;ldquo;offenders&amp;rdquo; groups or teams meet together to both resolve individual differences, repair hurt feelings and rebuild trust at the same time. In just a few hours individuals are able to understand what is really going on, see the situation from a variety of perspectives and come to a consensus on how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book provides a step-by-step, technique for mediating and resolving group disputes. Even the most dysfunctional group is able to overcome negative feelings and move toward a more positive future. In this book you will learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;properly talk to people in conflict&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;select those people who need to talk together&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;prepare individuals for the conversation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;facilitate the group conversation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;write up an action plan after the conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What people are saying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fitzgerald is at the cutting edge of bringing restorative practices to corporations. She provides wonderful real-life examples as well as an overview of how to do it.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;Ted Wachtel&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Real Justice&lt;/em&gt; and president of the International Institute for Restorative Practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s book is a must not just for managers but for anyone seeking to build respectful, productive relationships within any work environment.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;Barry Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, co-author of &lt;em&gt;Peacemaking Circles&lt;/em&gt; and retired judge, cse Consulting Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Maureen&amp;rsquo;s many stories and examples bring theory to life and provide us with a good sense of Corporate Circles in action.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt; Gary Harper&lt;/strong&gt;, author of the &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Joy of Conflict Resolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
