  <title>Maintenance Best Practices - Ramesh Gulati</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;quot;I have been a student of M&amp;amp;R for many years, though always in non-technical positions as a&amp;#160;professional marketer for products and services companies in the industrial space. I realized whenever I studied Maintenance and Reliability Best Practices in preparation for the CMRP exam, that I was on the right track. Thank you for allowing me to successfully pass the exam as a result of your book on top of the nearly eight years I&#39;ve been in the industry. I appreciate you very much.&amp;#160; I just received notice that I passed the CMRP from The Society for Maintenance and Reliability Professionals! Thank you for the opportunity to learn from you and for your encouragement.
