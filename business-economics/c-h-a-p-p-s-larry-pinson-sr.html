  <title>C.H.A.P.P.S - Larry Pinson Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Presently, the pay system used for U.S. postal employees to record clockable hours is complex and difficult to comprehend, even by employees, as well as supervisors.  C.H.A.P.P.S. is a simplified pay system designed for the postal payroll system, and with C.H.A.P.P.S. there is no need to cut jobs at the post office.  Larry Pinson, Sr. is a retired postal employee, and created C.H.A.P.P.S. after undertaking an endeavor to understand the postal service pay system, and found it to be antiquated and in need of change to modernize and simplify the system.  C.H.A.P.P.S. can also be used for city and county employees, teachers, police officers, and pay systems of other government agencies and large institutions; firemen, public transportation employees such as bus drivers; and private sector businesses, large and small, such as restaurants and barber shops.  Additionally, C.H.A.P.P.S. can be used for jobs worldwide, and is excellent for military people coming home. 
	Larry Pinson served 18 years in the Illinois National Guard.  He started working at the postal service in 1995, and retired in 2009.   Pinson liked the idea of working for the postal service, and initially believed it was a well organized organization, but was soon surprised to learn that it was far from well organized, particularly regarding the payroll application process.
