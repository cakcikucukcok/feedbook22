  <title>Dark Spell - Gill Arbuthnott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="15-year-old Callie Hall has just found out she&#39;s a witch, and things keep going wrong. Sometimes her mind seems to make things happen, things she can&#39;t control. She can set fire to things without a match, and when she&#39;s angry people can get hurt. Her friend Josh understands she&#39;s a bit weird, but its only on a dark and dangerous visit to the tunnels under the ruins of St Andrews&#39; castle that he realises just how strange she really is. Something comes back with Callie -- in Callie -- something she can&#39;t escape. Can Callie control her power long enough to send back the darkness, before it takes over her life? And will Josh ever understand her secret? A brilliant, engrossing teen fantasy from the author of Winterbringers and The Keeper&#39;s Daughter.15-year-old Callie Hall has just found out she&#39;s a witch, and things keep going wrong.
