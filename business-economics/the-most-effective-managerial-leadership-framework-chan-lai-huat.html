  <title>The Most Effective Managerial Leadership Framework - Chan Lai Huat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book was written with one idea in mind: to provide newly appointed or promoted managerial leaders with the knowledge  namely the MOST Effective Managerial Leadership Framework  to quickly become more effective managerial leaders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It does this by quickly laying out for the reader a set of principles that can be immediately applied to their daily work life to increase their effectiveness as managerial leaders (Or even (grandparent)parents, older siblings, student project group team leaders).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The critical knowledge is encapsulated in a mnemonic device to aid in quick recall and application.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book itself is then written in crisp, clear language that is easily understood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In addition, bearing in mind that people learns differently, the book is split into two halves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The first half of the book illustrates the mnemonic device  The MOST Effective Managerial Leadership Framework  using a storybook/fairy tale approach for those who learn best through exploratory narratives.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The second half of the book explains the mnemonic device in simple, clear, unadorned instructional guide forms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is left to the readers himself or herself to decide which learning method to use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Next, the book is designed as an atomic self-guide book that could be read in a short sitting  perhaps an hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally, it is intended that the book can be substituted for the annual Company Christmas Party useless-table-ornament-costing-less-than-ten-dollars Gift Exchange item.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Senior Managers may also purchase it as a present for entry level or newly appointed or promoted managers or even staff identified as potential future managerial leaders. It then serves as a useful handbook." />
