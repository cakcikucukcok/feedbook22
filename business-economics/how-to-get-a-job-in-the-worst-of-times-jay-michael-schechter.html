  <title>How to Get a Job in the Worst of Times - Jay Michael Schechter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SUMMARY
The purpose of this book is to how to pursue employment when the economy is in transition.  As I stated in my Preface, this book is intended as an experience from a person who has 85 jobs and counting.  I dont pretend to be an expert,  I am serving as a guidepost from experience.  The only way to learn something is by doing; and, as far as obtaining a job, I have a wealth of knowledge.
&lt;br&gt;The book is intended for the unemployed as well as the employed, veterans and college students; as well as advice and a warning to employers.
&lt;br&gt;Finally, I point to the foreign based employers as possibly a trend which can remake the American job market.
I hope these chapters can lift your spirits, and use it as a primer to staying employed." />
