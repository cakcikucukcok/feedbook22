  <title>Dressing Classy Doesn&#39;t Change - Joyce L. Christanio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have attended corporate conferences with female facilitators presenting workshops on topics including healthy eating and business networking skills. Too often I have seen dress attire that begged for improvement.  As I observed speakers and attendees in clothes that would be more appropriate for a different setting, I visualized becoming a public speaker traveling abroad, boosting women&#39;s self-esteem by providing advice on appropriate professional attire. This desire mingled with inspiration from my peers, family and friends, prompted me to write this book.  I believe readers will be encouraged to pass this information to their daughters, granddaughters, mentees and other women in their lives." />
