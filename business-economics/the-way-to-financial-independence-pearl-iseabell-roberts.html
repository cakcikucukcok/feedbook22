  <title>The Way to Financial Independence - Pearl Iseabell Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The way to financial independence is like building a house. You cant build unless you have a solid foundation. You need to have the desire, the determination, and the goals to become self-sufficient. Be confident in yourself and be motivated.
Lets name some of the building materials that you will need: education, as much as you can get, and the learning process never stops. As I converse with people, I find myself saying, I didnt know that!
While learning how to manage your money, also pay off your debts. Have a budget and saving plan. Be disciplined in spending. Dont be wasteful. Take time to get the best for your buck.
Learn how to invest. Know what you are investing in and how it will make you money. Do not do risky investment, and do not gamble and be responsible.
Learn everything that you can about finance and save, save, save." />
