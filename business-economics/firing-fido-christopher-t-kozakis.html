Firing Fido! is a self-help guide to pursuing success by learning to overcome &quot;Fido&quot; - misplaced loyalty to a person, belief, or habit that is unworthy of it. Learning to embrace healthy confrontation, and make the decision to deal with an abusive boss, face down an individual who doesn&#39;t keep his promises, stand firmly for one&#39;s ideals when confronted with shady or unethical business dealings, or stand up for oneself whenever faced with obstacles to success. Step-by-step instructions to becoming a master of healthy conflict and making a strong will work for oneself and one&#39;s career make for a powerfully charged and vital self-help guide.
&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Firing Fido! is a terrific idea... it shows how the workplace can be a whole lot better with a positive approach to confrontation... The reason you should have a copy is that you&#39;ll probably have a whole lot better time at the office and at home.&quot;
