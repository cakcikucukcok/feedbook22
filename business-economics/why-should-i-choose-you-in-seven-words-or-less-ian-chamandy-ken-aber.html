  <title>Why Should I Choose You (In Seven Words or Less)? - Ian Chamandy, Ken Aber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to answer the single most important question in business and life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why should I choose you?  That’s the question every customer asks every single time he buys a car, picks a shampoo, or chooses a distributor, a brokerage house, an animal hospital or a hairbrush.  Sometimes the question is spoken out loud; other times it’s subliminal.  But the fact is that every product, service or decision is a choice.  And often it’s a choice we make within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian Chamandy and Ken Aber understand just how essential that choice is. Their Toronto-based consulting firm, Blueprint, helps businesses define their specific promise--the one thing that sets them apart from every other organization that does more or less the same thing--in seven words or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their blueprinting process has produced extraordinary results for organizations big and small, in all sorts of industries, in both the for profit and not-for-profit sectors, including construction firms, marketing/communications consultancies, boutique investment banks, and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining  combines practical steps with case examples, &lt;em&gt;Why Should I Choose You (in Seven Words or Less)&lt;/em&gt; will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;give you confidence you never had before to lead into a bold new future&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;make your employees more innovative and creative&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reveal revenue streams you never knew existed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;give your employees a newfound sense of purpose that motivates them to contribute at a higher level&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and help you sell faster and more easily because you will inspire, rather than try to convince, customers to buy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
