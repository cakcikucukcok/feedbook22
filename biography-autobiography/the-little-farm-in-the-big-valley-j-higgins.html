  <title>The Little Farm in the Big Valley - J. Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;First there was Little House, then there was Little Farm. Laura Ingalls Wilder&#39;s saga continues into the twentieth century with The Little Farm in the Big Valley: a story for baby boomers and other generations as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;GO into the mind of the child in this childhood memoir.&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;SEE the &quot;play&quot; and the &quot;work&quot; among three generations in the rural heartland of America.&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;GO along with the boys on their country adventures.&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;SEE how things unfold as their family grows.&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a memoir of a childhood like many others and, still, unique in its setting. With the disappearance of small farms, the generations&#39; way of life disappears as well. It is only to be recalled by the written word and forms of media. Such is the purpose of the author, Eric Weidler, who thoroughly relates his early years on that &quot;little farm.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
