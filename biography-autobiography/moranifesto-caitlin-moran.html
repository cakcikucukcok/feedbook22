  <title>Moranifesto - Caitlin Moran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;How to Be a Woman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Moranthology &lt;/em&gt;comes a collection of Caitlin Moran&amp;#8217;s award-winning &lt;em&gt;London Times&lt;/em&gt; columns that takes a clever, hilarious look at celebrities, society, and the wacky world we live in today&amp;#8212;including three major new pieces exclusive to this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Caitlin Moran sat down to choose her favorite pieces for her new book, she realized that they all shared a common theme&amp;#8212;the same old problems and the same old ass-hats. Then she thought of the word &amp;#8216;Moranifesto&amp;#8217;, and she knew what she had to do&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing every piece and weaving her writing together into a brilliant, seamless narrative&amp;#8212;just as she did in &lt;em&gt;Moranthology&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;Caitlin combines the best of her recent columns with lots of new writing unique to this book as she offers a characteristically fun and witty look at the news, celebrity culture, and society. Featuring strong and important pieces on poverty, the media, and class, &lt;em&gt;Moranifesto&lt;/em&gt; also focuses on how socially engaged we&amp;#8217;ve become as a society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, Caitlin is never afraid to address the big issues, such as Benedict Cumberbatch and duffel coats. Who else but Caitlin Moran&amp;#8212;a true modern Renaissance woman&amp;#8212;could deal with topics as pressing and diverse as the beauty of musicals, affordable housing, Daft Punk, and why the Internet is like a drunken toddler? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covering everything from Hillary Clinton to UTIs, Caitlin&amp;#8217;s manifesto is an engaging and mischievous rallying call for our times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
