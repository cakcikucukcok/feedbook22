&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Full Circle: Escape from Baghdad and the Return&lt;/i&gt; chronicles a prominent
Iraqi Jewish familys escape from persecution, through the journey of
one family member, a young boy, who witnesses public hangings and the
1941 Krystallnacht (Farhood) in Baghdad. After a dangerous escape from
Iraq akin to a Sephardic Schindlers List, this ten-year-old begins a lifelong
search for meaning and his place in the world. This journey takes him to
the newly-formed nation of Israel, then to Brazil, and eventually to the
United States, where he serves in the US Army in Korea, works in top
level positions with three Fortune 500 companies, starts several businesses,
and volunteers to assist the FBI after September 11, 2001. This chronicle
strives to explore questions of meaning such as: Does hardship taint the
lure of adventure for any young man? What sustains hope? Does a
persecuted Jew ever feel at home anywhere? This young mans journey
and subsequent identity crisis interfaces with historical happenings in
the world and brings an understanding of the culture and contributions
of Sephardic Jews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There has been much written about the Jewish population in Germany
and Europe and what they suffered, but little is known about Sephardic
Jews who have also been persecuted in other countries, especially in Iraq,
a country of which we as Americans have some familiarity, but know very
little about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Published Author by Saul Silas Fathi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
December 5, 2005 (Central Islip, NY)  Historical conflicts, persecution and social unrests have always forced people to leave their homeland and move towards uncertainty. And because of these, the search for meaning only becomes more difficult and sometimes impossible. One man however overcame great odds and found meaning at last when he completed his great journey of life, and readers can experience it all by reading author Saul Silas Fathis amazing new book &lt;i&gt;Full Circle:  Escape From Baghdad and The Return. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Epic in proportion, &lt;i&gt;Full Circle&lt;/i&gt; tells the full life journey of the author who witnessed public executions as a young boy and escaped with his Iraqi Jewish family from certain persecution in Iraq during the mid twentieth century. At the age of ten, the author began an ambitious personal journey to find the meaning of life as well as his place in the world. Through the years, he traveled to the newly-formed Israel, to Brazil and eventually to the United States of America and in each country he learned and experienced a lot about life, culture, knowledge and survival. Determined to excel, Saul completed his education, joined the U.S. Army and ultimately he became an American citizen as well as a high-level executive working with Fortune-500 companies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Aside from his struggles and achievements, Sauls book explores the depths of mans search for meaning, which includes his insights about hope, his Sephardic Jewish heritage, the impacts of 9/11 and the Gulf War, identity crisis, and more. Readers will be astonished with the great" />
