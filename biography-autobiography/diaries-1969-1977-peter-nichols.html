  <title>Diaries 1969-1977 - Peter Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The playwright Peter Nichols has been a compulsive diarist all his life. He writes for himself alone, responding to an urge to record the daily doings, private and professional, of his family, his fellows - and himself. The resulting diaries are candid, insightful, and often as shockingly funny as his plays.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;amp;#13; &amp;amp;#13; &lt;p&gt;This selection, republished to mark the playwright&#39;s 90th birthday, covers the extraordinarily fruitful period between his first real hit, &lt;em&gt;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&lt;/em&gt;, to the stirrings of his masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;Passion Play&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;amp;#13; &amp;amp;#13; &lt;p&gt;As the seventies dawn, Peter Nichols is watching &lt;em&gt;Joe Egg&lt;/em&gt; being filmed - and hating it. His next play, &lt;em&gt;The National Health&lt;/em&gt;, is doing good box office for Olivier&#39;s National Theatre - but Olivier is hating it. And &lt;em&gt;Forget-Me-Not Lane&lt;/em&gt; is shortly to open at the new Greenwich Theatre amid much anxiety. And then there are three small children (and a fourth in long-term hospital) to cope with, an extended family and the renovation of a tumbledown barn in rural France.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;amp;#13; &amp;amp;#13; &lt;p&gt;What emerges is one of the most revealing and hilarious accounts of a writer&#39;s life, and how - whatever success comes along &amp;amp;#8211; everyday life will keep getting in the way. As Nichols attempts to negotiate the world he has found himself in &amp;amp;#8211; a world populated by the likes of Albert Finney, Kenneth Tynan, Stephen Sondheim, Michael Frayn and John Osborne &amp;amp;#8211; he finds that he is never free from having to entertain his in-laws or cope with children vomiting in the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;amp;#13; &amp;amp;#13; &lt;p&gt;Nichols&#39; &lt;em&gt;Diaries&lt;/em&gt; are a brilliantly funny, acerbic study of theatrical life, a warts-and-all portrait of parenthood, and a fascinating companion to that remarkable decade, the Seventies.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;amp;#13; &amp;amp;#13; &lt;p&gt;&#39;Sometimes he says terrible things that strike home to one&#39;s heart&#39; &lt;em&gt;Michael Frayn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
