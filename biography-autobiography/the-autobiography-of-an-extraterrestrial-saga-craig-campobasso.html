  <title>The Autobiography of an Extraterrestrial Saga - Craig Campobasso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1959, an ExtraTerrestrial incarnated on Earth. He doesnt remember who he is; but his cells hold his past-life memories. After twenty-six years of spiritual education as a human, Cosmic Thought Adjusters determine that he is ready to know the truth, so they awaken him to his heritage. He was an instructor at the University of Melchizedek, where he trained Mighty Messengers to incarnate on Earth for secret consciousness raising programs, and in this incarnation, he has traveled with them. This is the autobiography of Solar Commander Thyronwhose mission it is to unite Earth with Universal Society. 
Now that this Earthmans heart rules his mind, communications with enlightened extraterrestrials are permitted, and a trip to his home and awaiting family in the Pleiades Star System is facilitated.Ultimately, Thyrons Earth body is put into a slumber, and he is returned to his former Titan self. His family reunion is short-lived in the face of a galactic crisis. The evil forcesknowing of his brief homecomingsteal what is most precious to him, luring him into direct combat. 
His only armor is courage and a powerful Crystal Light Sword of Truth, given to him by Archangel Michael, his sovereign, just before he is thrust into the most barbaric cosmic war ever recorded. His enemy, the Dark Sa Tan, commands the Brubarian armiesterrifying beasts, who wield impressive black-art technologies. 
Now a leader amongst extraterrestrials in the Star Seed Alignment of Space Peoples and Planets, the fate of the universe hangs in the balance, and not even Thyron can imagine what awaits him.
