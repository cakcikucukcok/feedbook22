  <title>A Hidden Child in Greece - Yolanda Avram Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your story deserves to be widely heard.
Elie Wiesel, Nobel Prizewinning author and Holocaust survivor
----------------------------------------------------------------
Six-year-old Yolanda Avram is rescued by righteous strangers during the Holocaust in Greece. This is her story of courage and survival in the context of dozens of other rescues and shows Jews saving themselves and others in audacious and often heroic ways. Her story is uplifting and focuses on those flickers of light in the vast darkness of evil, known in Greece as the Persecution. This little-known saga of the common folk outwitting the Third Reich is a powerful and important story, told simply and movingly in cinematic episodes. The book is incandescent with empathy and gratitude.
What a powerful and moving story it is. 
Sir Martin Gilbert, official biographer of Winston Churchill, knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, and author of eighty-eight historical books
A Hidden Child in Greece is a monumental story that documents her familys miraculous survival in a unique and moving way. It gives life to the principle of human dignity and courage as a universal precept . . . this book is a true light unto the nations.
Yaffa Eliach, author and creator of the first university-level Holocaust curriculum and the Tower of Life, a 1,500-photograph permanent display at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC
Willis is Anne Frank, if Anne Frank had lived.
Diana Hume George, author and educator
For me, the heart of this book is the family storythe real power lays in the intimate story you are able to describe very simply and movingly.
