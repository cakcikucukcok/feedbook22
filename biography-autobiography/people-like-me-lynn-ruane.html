  <title>People Like Me - Lynn Ruane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A force of nature from the day she was born, Lynn Ruane grew up in a loving home in Tallaght, West Dublin. But in her early teens things began to unravel, and she fell into a life of petty crime and chaotic drug use. By age fifteen &amp;ndash; pregnant with her first child, no longer attending school and still reeling from a series of shocking incidents in her personal life &amp;ndash; Lynn decided she had enough of running away from herself and set about rebuilding her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by her daughter, she returned to education and, with the help of some brilliant mentors, slowly began to heal the hurt of her younger years. She began campaigning on behalf of the people society had left behind by developing addiction services, becoming an activist in Trinity, and then as a senator in the chamber of the Seanad.
