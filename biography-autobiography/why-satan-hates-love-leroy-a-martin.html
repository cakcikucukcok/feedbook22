  <title>Why Satan Hates Love - LeRoy A. Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Even in todays complicated and often uncertain world, God still works in the lives of the faithful. Yet despite the incredible power of Gods love, Satan still makes his presence known through selfishness, greed, and temptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Why Satan Hates Love&lt;/i&gt;, author LeRoy Martin relies on personal anecdotes, the stories of others, and his own ideas to share his comprehensive study of the Christian faith and Satanism. As he looks at why some marriages work and others do not, Martin explains the differences between couples who allow the devil to control their relationship and those who allow Jesus into their hearts and realize that it is their commitment to the marriage that makes it successful. Martin also delves into the reasons why we can trust and have confidence in Gods judgment, why we need to understand that Satan is a fallen angel, and why it is important to know and understand Gods plan for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is here for us. The spiritual wisdom provided in &lt;i&gt;Why Satan Hates Love&lt;/i&gt; proves that all we have to do is open our hearts and accept His love. &lt;/p&gt;" />
