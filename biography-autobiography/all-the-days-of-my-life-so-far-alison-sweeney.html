  <title>All The Days Of My Life (so Far) - Alison Sweeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;You think your life is nuts?  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Since I was sixteen, I&#39;ve spent time on Death Row, tried to sell my baby sister on the black market, been stranded at the altar (repeatedly), lied about my son&#39;s paternity, and fought viciously with just about everybody in town. Well, okay, it wasn&#39;t really me--it was my character, Sami Brady on &lt;i&gt;Days of Our Lives.&lt;/i&gt; But like Sami, I&#39;ve had my share of struggles. I&#39;ve been told I was fat, watched fellow actresses starve themselves, been cruelly rejected, and wondered if I would ever date. (Hey, the first time I kissed a boy was in front of a TV camera!) There was even a time when I hated myself.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Sound familiar? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  This is my story. It&#39;s an account of my years on daytime&#39;s most popular soap, and of my life off-screen--the major ups and downs, the craziness of Hollywood, balancing work and play, looking for love, concerns about weight, peer pressure, and finally learning to accept myself for who I am. I&#39;ll tell you fun stories about myself and my co-stars.  .  .recollections of my most memorable scenes.  .  .and everything you&#39;ve always wanted to know about Sami. I think you&#39;ll find a lot in these pages that will remind you of all the days of your life.  .  .and perhaps inspire you to follow your own dreams in the days to come.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;       &lt;b&gt;Alison Sweeney&lt;/b&gt; was born in Los Angeles, one of three children of a concert violinist mother and a business investor father.  Her acting career began when she was four years old. Throughout her childhood, Alison appeared in numerous television commercials, as well television series including &lt;i&gt;Friends, Simon &amp;amp; Simon, Webster, St. Elsewhere,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tales from the Darkside.&lt;/i&gt; She had starring roles in the films &lt;i&gt;The Price of Life&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The End of Innocence. &lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Alison joined the cast of &lt;i&gt;Days of Our Lives&lt;/i&gt; as Sami Brady in 1993. In her years on the series, her character has evolved from a troubled teenager to a scheming villainess. In 2002, Alison won a fan-voted Emmy as America&#39;s Favorite Villain. She has also won the fan-voted &lt;i&gt;Soap Opera Digest&lt;/i&gt; Award four times, and in 2001 was elected by the same publication as one of the Most Beautiful Women in Daytime Television. &lt;i&gt;Soap Opera Weekly&lt;/i&gt; named Alison 1999&#39;s Breakout Performer of the year, and in Australia, she was voted &quot;Best Bad Girl&quot; in 2000 and 2001 by readers of &lt;i&gt;Inside Soaps&lt;/i&gt; magazine.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Alison lives in a suburb of Los Angeles with her husband, Dave." />
