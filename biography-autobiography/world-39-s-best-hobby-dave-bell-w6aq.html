  <title>World&#39;s Best Hobby - Dave Bell W6AQ</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Worlds Best Hobby is an unusual title for a memoir, which is exactly what this book is.  Its my life in the fascinating hobby of Amateur Radio.  Much of my professional life is spent producing documentary and reality programs for television (including more than a few about Ham Radio) where I learned that the purpose of a title is to attract an audience and if it was also true, all the better.
The challenge with documentary films is to make them entertaining first and foremost, and informational if possible.  Ive tried very hard to make this book entertaining, and from feedback Ive gotten (from Hams and wannabee Hams who found it posted online as I was writing it) Ive succeeded, at least to some extent.  I tried to make the book fun because Ham Radio is fun. 
And Ham Radio has more facets than a cheap diamond, as youll discover as you dig into Worlds Best Hobby.  Enjoy!
PS.  Let me know what you think of Worlds Best Hobby  especially if you like it.
