  <title>D. Man: My Life and Boxing - Dr. John White, Grene Kilroy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Richie was the real deal. He knew how to work a corner. Yet, his book isnt a run-of-the-mill boxing story. Its a record of a time when a guy from the streets would fi nd a place like Mack Lewiss in Baltimore, not to learn a sport, but to survive. The fact that he spent time in two of the toughest gyms in America, Mr. Macks place and Johnny Toccos in Vegas, gives him a unique angle on the game. He knew the greats. Oh yeah. And he could write as well as he could throw a left hook. 
Gene Kilroy, trusted confidante and business manager for Muhammad Ali 
My friend John White digs deep into the typewritten reminiscences of a troubled man, Richie Westcott, and pulls forth a story much richer than any of us who knew him could ever have expected. 
Amazing Layla McCarter,
Six-time world champion &amp; female boxing pioneer 
I bought Richie a computer when I took over the gym. Of course, I had no idea he was turning out such a story. I really liked the guy. He worked hard to help the young fighters.
