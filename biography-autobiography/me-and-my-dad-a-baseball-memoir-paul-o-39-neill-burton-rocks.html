  <title>Me and My Dad: A Baseball Memoir - Paul O&#39;Neill, Burton Rocks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paul O&#39;Neill was the undisputed heart and soul of the four-time World Series-winning New York Yankees from 1993 to 2001. O&#39;Neill epitomized the team&#39;s motto of hard work and good sportsmanship, traits instilled in him by his friend, confidant, lifelong model, and biggest fan: his dad, Chick O&#39;Neill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Me and My Dad,&lt;/em&gt; O&#39;Neill writes from the heart about the man who inspired in him a love for the game and a determination to always play his best. O&#39;Neill remembers the highlights of his own amazing career: the Cincinnati Reds calling him up to the majors, his first World Series, being traded to the Yankees -- and taking part in their recent championship wins. He also reflects on his father&#39;s untimely death during the 1999 World Series and on the farewell tribute his fans gave him during his last game in Yankee Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;" />
