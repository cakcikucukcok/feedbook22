  <title>The Journey to Pentecost - Dr. Carolyn Starling-Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Carolyn Starling-Matthews is a native West Virginian who lived in Chicago, Illinois, for over fifty years. She is a retired educator/administrator from the Chicago Public School System and a proud mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother.
	Dr. Starling-Matthews felt the call of God on her life at a very young age as she sat at her mothers feet and traveled with her throughout the state of West Virginia to visit youth groups in various churches. During that time, she determined within herself to become a mentor and role model for youth everywhere who desired to walk closely with the Lord. She wanted to promote their self-esteem and encourage them to prepare themselves both spiritually and academically in their quest to please God and work successfully in their chosen career.
	Dr. Starling-Matthews has traveled throughout the United States as an inspirational speaker conducting leadership conferences and as a seminar facilitator promoting excellence in the service of the Lord. She is an acclaimed event coordinator and leader of womens ministries. She has enjoyed holding a wide range of positionsboth professionally and spiritually. She counts her experiences all joy and esteems her work in ministry support just as valuable as her roles of leadership. Her signature theme is: We Are All Somebody In Jesus! 
	She thanks God for the opportunity to work with her husband, Bishop John D. Matthews Sr., in ministry as he serves as pastor and Diocesan Bishop in the state of Louisiana." />
