  <title>No Man&#39;s War: Irreverent Confessions of an Infantry Wife - Angela Ricketts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Raised as an Army brat, Angie Ricketts thought she knew what she was in for when she eloped with Darrin&amp;#151;then an infantry lieutenant&amp;#151;on the eve of his deployment to Somalia. Since that time, Darrin, now a colonel, has been deployed eight times, serving four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. And Ricketts, has lived every one of those deployments intimately&amp;#151;distant enough to survive the years spent apart from her husband, but close enough to share a common purpose and a lifestyle they both love.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With humor, candor, and a brazen attitude, Ricketts pulls back the curtain on a subculture many readers know, but few ever will experience. Counter to the dramatized snap shot seen on Lifetime&amp;#8217;s Army Wives, Ricketts digs into the personalities and posturing that officers&amp;#8217; wives must survive daily&amp;#151;whether navigating a social event on post, suffering through a husband&amp;#8217;s prolonged deployment or reacting to a close friend&amp;#8217;s death in combat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At its core, &lt;I&gt;No Man&amp;#8217;s War&lt;/I&gt; is a story of sisterhood and survival. As Ricketts states: &amp;#147;We tread those treacherous waters together. Do we sometimes shove each other&amp;#8217;s heads under water for a few seconds? Maybe even on purpose? Of course. Are we sometimes dragged underwater ourselves by the undertow created by all of us struggling together too closely? Without a doubt. But we never let each other drown. Our buoyancy is our survival.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;" />
