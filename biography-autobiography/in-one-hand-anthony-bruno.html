Posted August 18, 2010, 10:13 PM EST: A thrilling read, &quot;In One Hand&quot; quickly takes you by the hand and leads you through the early adult life of the main character, Tony Sardelli. A Brooklyn born only child of very loving Italian parents, Tony is first headed to the U.S.Army. From here he swiftly picks you up and engulfs you in both the very good and very hard times of his early adulthood. Army life, N.Y.C. Police Department, friendship, marriage, devotion, and integrity all displayed with the undertones of both his loving, Christian Italian upbringing and his tough Brooklyn attitude keeps the reader engulfed in this story.

Posted October 9, 2010, 1:07 PM EST: In One Hand is an easy read, the kind of book that keeps you saying &quot;I&#39;ll read just one more chapter&quot; Mr. Bruno introduces his character as a young man as he enters into the army, and then quickly brings us to what becomes Tony&#39;s first love. the 7th precinct. The author gives us a true look at what being a N.Y.C. police officer was like in the 60&#39;s. The friendships he made, as well as the hard decisions that kept him true to his own beliefs. Tony Sardelli is a character that you love and hate at the same time. Living a playboy life style, he is the man that most women have loved once in their life, and the man that most men want to be like. Tony has a very cocky attitude, and never apologizes for it. He is a man who controls but will not be controlled. His relationship with his wife, a famous movie star and a wealthy woman show us that Tony will stay in control and do things his way. That is until the author introduces Allison. the one woman that went against everything that Tony wanted, but the one woman he couldn&#39;t seem to walk away from. The relationship with Allison introduces a new side of Tony, a tender side. A side that Tony tries to hide. Allison keeps drawing him back like a magnet, until he meets Kristin, the one person that lets Tony walk away from Allison for good. Kristin, the one person who can give Tony everything he wants, or so he thinks. And then, the author gives us the most surprising ending. One that could not be anticipated. I hope that the author is working on a sequel. I am anxious to know what happens to our character. Enjoyable read! I highly recommend &quot;In One Hand&quot;." />
