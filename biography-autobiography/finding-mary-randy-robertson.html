  <title>Finding Mary - Randy Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells the story of one family. Its a personal journey as all these journeys are, but it generously points out a path that others may choose to follow. 
Michael Compain, M.D., Rhinebeck Health Center
When Randy and Deborah Robertsons young daughter, Mary, was diagnosed with autism in 2005, the initial shock momentarily immobilized them. But a determination to reclaim their daughters life propelled them to make an unusual decisionto reverse the autism diagnosis.
Finding Mary is the Robertson familys compelling true story of how they tackled the disease head-on and found remarkable success. From the initial diagnosis to Marys incredible recovery process, Randy Robertson explains how the family explored treatment options, looked into alternative therapies, and never gave up hope. 
Combining the results of his in-depth research with an easy-to-understand style, Robertson shares the familys incredible journey by detailing the critical steps necessary for reducing or completely eliminating many autistic behaviors. These steps include:
	Testing for autism and coping with the diagnosis
	Getting early intervention
	Constructing a support team
	Creating an impactful IEP
	Embracing alternative therapies
	Forming academic strategies
	Building upon emerging strengths
	Visualizing success
With a foreword by noted autism expert Dr. Michael Compain of the Rhinebeck Health Center, Finding Mary offers encouragement and support for families struggling to deal with an autism diagnosis. But its also an intimate glimpse into one familys unyielding dedication to releasing their daughter from the prison of autism." />
