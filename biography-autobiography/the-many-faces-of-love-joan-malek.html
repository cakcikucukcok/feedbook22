  <title>The Many Faces of Love - Joan Malek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In writing this book, Joan hopes it will reach out to others of her generation, who were born and lived in her hometown of Brighton. Who will remember with her, the joys of childhood there, the finding of the first jobs, first puppy love, and the coming of war. That was going to change all there lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they too met a new culture, that was beautiful, as I did, Poland. Certain too, there will be ones who found The Many Faces Of Love the tradegies, such as Joan did, and surmounted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, as they read, it will be with a smile and tears. In all she hopes it can bring the warmth of the past to them, maybe even the younger ones will find some of the magic, the tears and the joy that she did. If so, then the writing of this book will have been a comforting and worthwhile thing to have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is like giving birth and creating again the circle of creation, in love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
