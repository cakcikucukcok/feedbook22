  <title>Chiseled - Julie Ann Somers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chisel yourself free from harmful strongholds and discover your true belonging!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a sense of directness this book will tell of my lifes mishaps, curses and good fortune.  And how now with undaunted devotion blessings come more frequently as evil subsides.  Hopefully as you read you will be moved in a positive direction that will help you conquer lifes constant battleswithout spending too much time in the self-help section at your local bookstore like I did!  You can find strength through all trials and tribulations no matter where you are.  Help is within, and by reaching near to Divinity you will undoubtedly come upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A past coach of mine said: Most of us are psychological basket cases in one form or another.  I believe that in a sense.  In fact, the sufferings I see among others make me realize how wonderful my life really iswhile another may look at me and say the same.  We all have different stories some worse than the next.  Whether its your health; lack of discipline, motivation, or job; loss of a loved one; struggle with addiction; a difficult relationshipor maybe you have yet to meet your true love and youre spending life alone; we all suffer in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delight in knowing that no matter what your situation you can learn to pull through any conditionvast or minusculeby a Divine Power as I have.  With strong conviction borne from past and present experiences, I know that God is leading my way.  I was led and protected by the Holy Spirit to the point of recognition: once I became aware of His closeness I held on to that.  And by will, not force, I have continued to carry and fulfill my soul with the most beautifully awaited kinship imaginable.  My decision has left me with more confidence, comfort and joy than I ever dreamed possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am no religious scholar, and my quest is not to try and reel you into some supernatural cult.  I am just another fleshly individual making my way, like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book I disclose my ongoing endeavors in the hope of helping you have a better understanding of what it takes to fulfill your spiritual being with such life-changing, glorious power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow God to form you from the inside out.  Grant Him the right to do the molding while He provides you gear to assist Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book also includes topics on relationships, addiction, and health and fitness!&lt;/p&gt;" />
