  <title>The Roving Eye - Richard Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Go. Be there. For the past six decades Richard Evans has followed that dictum - being where the action was, not just as a tennis writer and broadcaster - 196 Grand Slams and counting - but through his years as a foreign correspondent in America, France and Vietnam as well as a spell as a roving global reporter for the US television programme Entertainment Tonight.&lt;br&gt;Evans, whose English family fled France in June 1940, also became a National Service Captain in the British army, without having to dodge a bullet which was not the case in Cambodia nor in Miami where he was struck by a cop during an anti-Nixon demonstration.&lt;br&gt;Evans was in Memphis hours after Martin Luther King was shot; campaigned through Indiana and California with Bobby Kennedy - &quot;a unique politician&quot; - before he, too, was assassinated and witnessed the pre-Olympic demonstrations in 1968 against the Mexican Government which ended in massacre.&lt;br&gt;He accompanied the Wimbledon champion and activist Arthur Ashe on two trips to Africa, witnessing the dark days of apartheid and was back in South Africa in 1990 covering Mike Gatting&#39;s rebel cricket tour during the historic weeks that saw Nelson Mandela released and apartheid abolished.&lt;br&gt;Evans paints an insider&#39;s portrait of Margaret Thatcher and No 10 Downing Street during the time he was with the Prime Minister&#39;s daughter, Carol; a romance with the actress Gayle Hunnicutt and two marriages; friendships with Richard Harris, Michael Crawford and more Wimbledon champions than you could fit into the players&#39; box. He was also the last person to interview Richard Burton.&lt;br&gt;A life lived to the full, covering the globe with a Roving Eye - being there.&lt;/p&gt;" />
