  <title>Memoirs of My Childhood - Annice Browne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The late Fifties to Sixties in the Caribbean was an era of mass migration by young people between the ages of twenty to forty years old they travelled alone to developed countries in pursuit of a better life.  This mass exodus divided families it was a huge sacrifice for many parents with children.  They were left with grandparents or extended family members to take care of them.  Annice was raised by grandparents after her parents immigrated to the England.
This book is about an intrepid childhood journey, which takes you back to the Sixties lifestyle.  Annice highlights the stark contrast between the culture of the Caribbean and that of the UK.  She recalls how families coped without electricity and running water in homes.
As well as containing wise words to inspire all ages, this book offers an adventurous collection of childhood mischief, fun, and laughter.  At the very least, its a trip down memory lane, a reminiscence of bygone days, and for young readers, its a journey to an imagined past.
Annice Brownes career spans over thirty years as a Personal Assistant during which she gained professional qualifications in Secretarial work, Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) in computer studies.  The idea to write her childhood memoirs came about after reading books by the novelist Catherine Cookson, and many autobiographies of famous people (Maya Angelou and Nelson Mandela to name a few).  Annice is inspired by the author Iyanla Vanzant, and her unique style of writing.  Annices daily motto is: We should live our lives with good intentions." />
