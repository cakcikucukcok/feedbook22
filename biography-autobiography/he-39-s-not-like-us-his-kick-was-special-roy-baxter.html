  <title>He&#39;s Not Like Us. His Kick Was Special. - Roy Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can anything good come from that terrible city called Newark, New Jersey, where a large number of African Americans reside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, without a doubt. What the Creator has in store for us is truly remarkable. No opposition on earth can stand in the way if he has something special for you to accomplish. Lack of wealth is really not that big a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sizable number of people live in the northeast quadrant of these United States. To stand out or be recognized in a particular area of expertise is a daunting task. Who has the critical eye, and why cant they see? Another one has shot up into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In earlier decades, African Americans migrated to the northern cities to find employment. People of color had a realistic understanding that if they worked hard, they could at the very least make a living. Generally, people worked very hard during the day. Once that powerful sun set, it was a whole other ball game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Citys biggest and brightest stars showcased their talents across the waters. New Jerseys most-populated city was the serious after-party place to be. Other cities or towns could show you a good time, but Newark was the party town. The jazz clubs and night life were second to none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People kept coming to Newark, and the city kept growing. The Irish resided in the Vailsburg section; West Ward housed the Irish and the Italians. East Ward housed the Portuguese; South Ward housed the Jewish and African Americans. North Ward housed Italians, African Americans, and Spanish people. Central Ward also housed the Jewish and African Americans. Generally, people felt comfortable in their established communities. If you were found to be in the wrong part of town, that might be somewhat of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;" />
