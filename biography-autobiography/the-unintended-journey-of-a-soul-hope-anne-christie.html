  <title>The Unintended Journey of a Soul - Hope-Anne Christie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The challenges in author Hope-Anne Christies life brought her to where she is today. If the events hadnt happened the way they did, she believes she wouldnt be as spiritually aware or conscious of her lifes purpose. In The Unintended Journey of a Soul, she shares her healing journey, a journey that took many twists and turns throughout her lifetime. 
In this memoir, Christie trudges through the debris of her childhood which was marked by illness and physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. Some of her experiences felt like her life was about to change for the better, only to have her world come crashing down again. The peaks and valleys were almost more than she could bear. The Unintended Journey of a Soul exposes these experiences, raw and uncompromised.
Christie also tells how from a young age, she had an inner knowing that an energy force was always with her and how at age fifty she discovered she was a healer of many, finally realizing her calling and her purpose. She reflects on her experiences intent on helping others start their own healing process. 
The Unintended Journey of a Soul narrates a story about the long, arduous path that brought Christie from darkness into light and from the depths of despair to heights unimaginable." />
