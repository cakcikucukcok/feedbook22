  <title>Two for the Road - Shirley Hardy-Rix, Brian Rix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roads are for journeys, not destinations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 2003 Melbourne couple Shirley Hardy-Rix and her husband Brian Rix fulfilled a lifelong ambition of motorcycling across the world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In an incredible 350-day journey, they would do everything they&#39;d ever dreamed of as well as getting much more than they&#39;d bargained for. Crossing 27 countries and covering 56,671 kilometres, they raced around the Isle of Man motorcycle circuit on Mad Sunday, survived Iran&#39;s traffic and travelled through Taliban strongholds under armed guard. Shirley and Brian&#39;s story is an epic account of the ups and downs of seeing the world on two wheels - from the frustrations of potholes and flat tyres, to the splendour of some of Europe and Asia&#39;s most awe-inspiring sights.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full of terrific anecdotes, down-to-earth humour and practical advice, &lt;i&gt;Two for the Road&lt;/i&gt; is a must for anyone who&#39;s ever imagined escaping the daily grind to experience the romance of the open road." />
