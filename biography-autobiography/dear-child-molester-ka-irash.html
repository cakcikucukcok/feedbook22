  <title>Dear Child Molester - Ka Irash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have learned and finally accept that there is no complete restoration from the horrific damage caused by sexual child abuse. This damage on some level is permanent. The victim must learn to live with the harm that has been forced into their lives. Shame and guilt takes great control of a victims life, yet with help one can learn that they are not at fault for this abuse and no longer live a life burdened with shame and guilt. A victim can gain self-worth and in time learn to become emotionally healthy and complete. Part of the healing process is to learn that the abuse will always be a part of the victims history, yet it doesnt have to control the victims future. 
Shame and guilt controlled many areas of my life most of my life. The destruction of my abuse has been a fight for me to over come. This fight raged on even when I didnt understand the causes for my low self esteem, depressions and shyness, which I dealt with the greatest part of my life. These emotions were rooted deep into my soul. All of these terrible emotions that I dealt with over the years were caused by the abuse that I suffered with at the hands of the Monster. 
This abuse was my ultimate betrayal this abuse is every victims ultimate betrayal. 
A Victims silence is the child molesters protection" />
