  <title>Cuckoo&#39;s Nest - Chris Chorlton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Telling stories of growing up in postwar Britain, starting a new life in Canada, raising a family, working in a major corporation, experiencing an active retirement, and enjoying the pleasure of grandchildren, &lt;i&gt;Cuckoos Nest&lt;/i&gt; tells the life story of author Chris Chorlton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a dash of humour, a touch of sadness, a pinch of whimsy, and a little dose of reality, Chorlton describes his escapades with doctors, his attempts to outfox squirrels, his experiment with hypnotism, and how he met his wife. His memoir also recalls his last day at the office, the challenges of carrying a piano down stairs, the memories of an emotional Remembrance Day ceremony, the illness of his newborn grandson, the loss of some schoolboy heroes and older friends, and his commitment to Rotary. Chorlton shares real stories of a real life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Praise for Cuckoos Nest
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Chris Chorlton puts a fresh face on old truths. He has a knack for placing the reader at the heart of his very charming personal storieswhich gently unfold to reveal the common bonds we all share.&lt;br&gt;
John Stewart, Mississauga News&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Please read these tales told by my friend and former colleague Chris Chorlton. Like me, I believe
you may recognize a little of yourself, you will have a good laugh and, yes, perhaps shed a tear.&lt;br&gt;
Sir Graham Day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Stories I can relate to. Cuckoos nest brings people in everyday situations to life, with some surprises. Read ityoull enjoy it. Buy ityoull help The Rotary Foundation.&lt;br&gt;
