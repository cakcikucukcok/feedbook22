  <title>Raising Blaze - Debra Ginsberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you have a child that doesn&#39;t fit in, what do you do? Debra Ginsberg knew that her son, Blaze, was unique from the moment he was born in 1987. What she didn&#39;t know was that Blaze&#39;s differences would be regarded by the outside world not as gifts, but as impediments to social and academic success. Blaze never crawled. He just got up and walked when he turned one. He called his mother &#39;Zsa Zsa&#39; until he was three. By kindergarten, he loved the music of Miles Davis and Ella Fitzgerald. He fears butterflies and is fascinated by garbage trucks. With the same honesty that made &lt;em&gt;Waiting&lt;/em&gt; a success, &lt;em&gt;Raising Blaze: Bringing Up an Extraordinary Son in an Ordinary World&lt;/em&gt; chronicles Debra&#39;s experience in raising a child who has defied definition by the host of professionals who have sought to label his differences. Ginsberg introduces us to a remarkable child and her own unusual childhood. She writes about a family which shows us the redemptive power of faith, humour and love. &lt;/p&gt;" />
