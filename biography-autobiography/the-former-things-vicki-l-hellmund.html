  <title>The Former Things - Vicki L. Hellmund</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did you ever think in your heart, If there is a God, where is he? I did, a lot.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child I started on a search for what I began to call the God of the Old Testament, and what I meant by that was the God who actually showed up and did things, the God who was personally involved in our lives.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My search took me down many paths. A child of the sixties, my paths included sex, drugs, rock and roll, and the occult. My search ended one night when, in pain and desperation, I threw a Bible I had been trying to read at a wall, shook my fist at the ceiling, and cried out, I dont know if you are real or not, but if You are real, You better do something! I dont care what You do, but do something!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didnt know, as I sobbed myself to sleep that night, that God had heard my heartfelt cry and that I was about to meet the One for whom I had been searchingnor did I know that He was far more than I ever imagined.&lt;p&gt;" />
