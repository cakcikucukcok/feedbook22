  <title>Astonish - Claire Luvet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This journey has taught me that you must first heal spiritually in order to heal physically. Praise God often. Repent for sins throughout the day and before you go to sleep. Tell Jesus how grateful you are for paying your debt. Tell Jesus how much you love him. Know that you are a sinner and that there is nothing you can do to repay Jesus for dying on the cross. Resist the enemy. If I felt negative energy, I would lift my hands and say I resist the devil. Satan, you are dead in Jesus name. If you are in immediate danger, say Jesus help me and end all your prayers in Jesus name. Remain calm by reminding yourself that God is bigger than the storm and that he can perform miracles. Being calm readies your instincts, and you can hear the Lord when you direct you. Love your enemies. Your enemies are being used by the devil to stop you from accomplishing Gods will. Holding hatred for someone or for an unpleasant event feeds the enemy. It will become a stronger presence in your life. Its normal to become angry for things that hurt you, but its not okay to stay angry. Love God more than you love yourself." />
