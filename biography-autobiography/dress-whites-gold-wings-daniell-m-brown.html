  <title>Dress Whites, Gold Wings - Daniell M. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="True experiences of a Georgia country boy who grew up to fly in Vietnam&#39;s non-war.  Stories to make you not only smile and laugh, but ponder life&#39;s mysteries and blessings.  Stories the author believes could be told and re-told to generations.  Auto-biographical in the sense that the author lived and loved in the times and events chronicled.  Written just as a storyteller might weave tales of adventure, love, heroism, family, friends, and deaths of comrades.  The little stories that make life real.
 &lt;p&gt;
Read along as the author grasps the finality of death as a first grader, then at 16-years, stares into the barrel of a .38 revolver.  Visit the back roads of Cuba during Castro&#39;s revolution, meet Miss America, hear about Connie Francis, and talk with Tennessee Williams.  Then orbit overhead while John Glenn launches into history.  Climb in the cockpit as co-pilot for gripping flight experiences during 3 tours to war-torn Vietnam.  Enjoy unusual personal and flight experiences while in scenic Italy for author&#39;s last duty station before military retirement.
 &lt;p&gt;
Then the real change of life:  At 41, a beautiful baby girl enters the scene.  Add a thief&#39;s break-in while on vacation at the beach, two cancer scares, the impulsive yen to write a book, all while trying to decipher the author&#39;s version of the meaning of life.  Find all the above plus lots of little sidebar stories that make life so real, so interesting, so enjoyable -it&#39;s all there in 370 pages of &lt;b&gt;Dress Whites, Gold Wings&lt;/b&gt;." />
