  <title>The Wild, Wild East - Alan Refkin, Daniel Borgia PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anyone who wants to do business in China must understand its customs, people, and culture. Just because its economy is exploding doesnt mean that anyone can go there and make a fortune. In fact, business practices are still deeply rooted in ancient cultural traditions. A Western businessperson who wants to succeed must understand all the ruleseven the ones that arent written down.&lt;/p&gt;
Join Alan Refkin, an American financier, as he takes a Chinese company through a painstaking process so it can be publicly listed on the U.S. capital markets. He learns how to do business in China the hard way, and now he shares his secrets so capitalists can navigate its contemporary terrain. You will learn why, in China, its all about the money; how to assemble deals in China; how to close the deal when working with the Chinese; and much more!&lt;/p&gt;
The names of the firms and individuals have been changed, but the story and lessons in this business guidebook are completely true. Join an American businessman as he seeks to make his fortune in &lt;i&gt;The Wild, Wild East.&lt;/i&gt;" />
