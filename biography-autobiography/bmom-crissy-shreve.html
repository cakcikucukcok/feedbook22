  <title>Bmom - Crissy Shreve</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rich and real, BMom is one woman&#39;s mosaic of love, life and loss, and of being found among the pieces.  No one piece is a whole, yet all are precious, together a masterpiece, and each a gem.  It&#39;s God restoring the shattered pieces of my life and my soul.  His fingerprints are all over it.  The reader will laugh and the reader will cry, and in that, we will become friends.
BMom begins with my relinquishing my infant son into the hands of parents I couldnt know.  It moves through the intervening years until he found me, on to our reunion, and beyond.  Not only was I reunited with my son, I was reunited with myself.
Interspersed are various interludes that speak of lessons learned, feelings finally understood and felt, and poetry written as part of my journey.  BMom is entertaining and engaging, while occasionally making a point, to be taken or not, as the reader chooses.
BMom is, above all else, a good read." />
