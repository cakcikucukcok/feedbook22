  <title>The Nine of Us - Jean Kennedy Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this evocative and affectionate memoir, Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, the last surviving child of Joe and Rose Kennedy, offers an intimate and illuminating look at a time long ago when she and her siblings, guided by their parents, laughed and learned a great deal under one roof.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompted by interesting tidbits in the newspaper, Rose and Joe Kennedy would pose questions to their nine children at the dinner table. &quot;Where could Amelia Earhart have gone?&quot; &quot;How would you address this horrible drought?&quot; &quot;What would you do about the troop movements in Europe?&quot; It was a nightly custom that helped shape the Kennedys into who they would become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Joe and Rose&amp;#8217;s children emerged as leaders on the world stage, they were a loving circle of brothers and sisters who played football, swam, read, and pursued their interests. They were children inspired by parents who instilled in them a strong work ethic, deep love of country, and intense appreciation for the sacrifices their ancestors made to come to America. &quot;No whining in this house!&quot; was their father&amp;#8217;s regular refrain. It was his way of reminding them not to complain, to be grateful for what they had, and to give back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her remarkable memoir, Kennedy Smith&amp;#8212;the last surviving sibling&amp;#8212;revisits this singular time in their lives. Filled with fascinating anecdotes and vignettes, and illustrated with dozens of family pictures, &lt;em&gt;The Nine of Us&lt;/em&gt; vividly depicts this large, close-knit family during a different time in American history. Kennedy Smith offers indelible, elegantly rendered portraits of her larger-than-life siblings and her parents. &quot;They knew how to cure our hurts, bind our wounds, listen to our woes, and help us enjoy life,&quot; she writes. &quot;We were lucky children indeed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
