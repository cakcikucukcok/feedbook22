  <title>Notes on a Banana - David Leite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A FINALIST FOR THE NEW ENGLAND BOOK AWARD FOR NON FICTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A PASTE BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONE OF TIMEOUT NEW YORK&amp;#8217;S BEST SUMMER BEACH READS OF 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONE OF REAL SIMPLE&amp;#8217;S 25 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FATHER&amp;#8217;S DAY BOOKS THAT COVER ALL OF DAD&amp;#8217;S INTERESTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stunning and long-awaited memoir from the beloved founder of the James Beard Award-winning website Leite&amp;#8217;s Culinaria&amp;#8212;a candid, courageous, and at times laugh-out-loud funny story of family, food, mental illness, and sexual identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born into a family of Azorean immigrants, David Leite grew up in the 1960s in a devoutly Catholic, blue-collar, food-crazed Portuguese home in Fall River, Massachusetts. A clever and determined dreamer with a vivid imagination and a flair for the dramatic, &amp;#8220;Banana&amp;#8221; as his mother endearingly called him, yearned to live in a middle-class house with a swinging kitchen door just like the ones on television, and fell in love with everything French, thanks to his Portuguese and French-Canadian godmother. But David also struggled with the emotional devastation of manic depression. Until he was diagnosed in his mid-thirties, David found relief from his wild mood swings in&amp;#160;learning about food, watching Julia Child, and cooking for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes on a Banana is his heartfelt, unflinchingly honest, yet tender memoir of growing up, accepting himself, and turning his love of food into an award-winning career. Reminiscing about the people and events that shaped him, David looks back at the highs and lows of his life: from his rejection of being gay and his attempt to &amp;#8220;turn straight&amp;#8221; through Aesthetic Realism, a cult in downtown Manhattan, to becoming a writer, cookbook author, and web publisher, to his twenty-four-year relationship with Alan, known to millions of David&amp;#8217;s readers as &amp;#8220;The One,&amp;#8221; which began with (what else?) food. Throughout the journey, David returns to his stoves and tables, and those of his family, as a way of grounding himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blend of Kay Redfield Jamison&amp;#8217;s An Unquiet Mind, the food memoirs by Ruth Reichl, Anthony Bourdain, and Gabrielle Hamilton, and the character-rich storytelling of Augusten Burroughs, David Sedaris, and Jenny Lawson, Notes on a Banana is a feast that dazzles, delights, and, ultimately, heals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
