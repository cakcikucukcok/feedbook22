  <title>Riches to Rags Through Cybercrime - Brandon M. Cipriano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a nonfiction story about a normal, everyday family living the American dream. They lived in a home filled with love and laughter until it all changed in the blink of an eye due to cybercriminals. Their situation got so intense and dangerous that they lost everything, becoming homeless and penniless. They had to beg strangers on the streets for money just to eat. 
This was no game that the cybercriminals were playing. They were out to destroy this once-happy family. The familys cat died due to a lethal dose of rat poisoning. 
The stress they experienced caused illness for the entire family. The parents ended up in the hospital with major problems, such as heart attacks and cancer. This was a petrifying experience for everyone, but most of all for the young son. He didnt know or understand how to cope with this horrifying ordeal that was transpiring around him; the only recourse that he could think of was to use self-harm to numb the painthe irony of using pain to deal with pain." />
