  <title>Running with God an Autobiography by Patrick Dicicco - Patrick R. DiCicco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a spiritual journey that travelled through the mean streets of Youngstown,Ohio to the calmer countrysides of California. It is a story of overcoming adversity, and having a burning desire to succeed, all the while trusting and believing in God. Pat DiCicco was born at an Army Base in Monterrey, California at the end of World War II, and was subsequently raised dysfunctionally in Youngstown, Ohio. While a teenager, he experienced a fore-telling dream which dramatically altered the way he lived, and yet another vivid dream which released him from the bonds of death. Throughout his journey, he survived numerous accidents and turns in his life that led him to believe his journey was a spiritual one, a journey greater than merely existing. Come with us now as we walk the tightrope we call life and swim in the ever changing times. Read and see if you can identify with Pats experiences, his life changing events, and the way they changed his life and hopefully those around him." />
