  <title>The Incarceration of the Mind - Mgcini Mlangeni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In my career journey I have engaged myself on diverse placements! One of the major personal tasks I have embarked myself on was when I joined the Roman Catholic Church as an aspiring future priest, and this formation process lasted a period of four years (studying philosophy, sociology, anthropology, psychology, politics, and theology etc. I was awarded with a diploma in Philosophy and an advance English Certificate by UNISA). Complimenting my training as a future priest was also involved on a variety of projects and events with the diversified communities of Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban, and Pinetown simultaneously. This passion to serve as an aspirant priest, and to make a positive change within my circle of influence and beyond led to the formation of my non-profit organization called Young Generational Thinkers. In principle  one of the objectives, goals, and mission of this organization going forward is to:
	create sustainable poverty alleviation projects, and
	to make provision of bursaries to the illiterate and those who are from the disadvantaged backgrounds.
	Create an environment of safety and healthy living, by
	formulating support groups, small, medium, and micro enterprises, reintroduce strong farming teams, and formulating self-sufficient entrepreneurial businesses, and thus
	create a space for job opportunities and well-functioning and self-sufficient community development projects.
	It is an undeniable fact that without education and necessary skills of entrepreneurship, the global advocacy issues facing the youth in areas of crime, drug abuse, unemployment, poverty, shortages of necessary skills, and fatal diseases would remain the struggle for survival for the entire international community. With major emphasis on education, entrepreneurship, and skills development by the individuals, in particular the youth, fewer and fewer cases of delinquency would be reported. Mentorship programmes in place and good governance of all stakeholders involved would lead to the success of the international community.
	In my line of duty I have worked with a variety of public and private sector structures like the South African Department of Sports and Recreation, eThekwini Municipality  Safer City Programme, Department of Community Participation, Department of Skills Development, Youth Commission, South African Red Cross, Durban Chamber of Commerce, South African Police Service, and Non-profit organizations like Right to Care, Love Life, Future leaders, National Youth Development agency just to mention a few. I was also involved on numerous national and international level on development and sustainable projects and events. With this in mind, I am optimistic that this manuscript would be embraced beyond measure, as I am a born philanthropist who is less motivated by money and prestige. To the contrary, I am motivated by making a difference, and making this world a better place for our generations generation to come." />
