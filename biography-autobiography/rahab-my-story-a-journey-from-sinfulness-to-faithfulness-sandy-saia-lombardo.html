      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rahab of Jericho had a lucrative business as an innkeeper, providing travelers with much more than the basic necessities. With all of her wealth and material possessions, something was still missing. After hearing many stories about a God who loves and cares for His people, she was convicted of her sinful ways. Is there a God who forgives sins and promises a hope and a future? Rahab wanted to know! She prayed to the Israelite God, Yahweh, asking Him to guide her down a path of righteousness and to never leave her nor forsake her. This discussion guide will point you to the One who loves you, forgives sins, and promises to give you hope and a future.&lt;/p.
&lt;p&gt;Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&lt;/p&gt;
