  <title>Jack&#39;s Diary - A. J. Brennen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes life can throw you a curve ball and it is what you decide to do with that curve ball that will change everything. My life has been one disappointment after another and all I ever wanted was to be loved for the person I am and for everyone just to get along. Not much to ask now is it. This is where I was totally wrong. I gave up on what I wanted just to please everyone else, from finding the love of my life to being given an ultimatum to choose between Lucy and my family. Everyone I ever cared about has torn me apart. However, I just forgive them over and over as the mere thought of losing my family is too much to bare. 
Everywhere I turn all I get is abuse from my father to a school teacher and my peers. When will it stop, why do these people feel they have the right to treat me like this, why do they think they have the right to abuse and hit me. It just doesnt stop they just keep pushing me and pushing me, until I cant take any more. In sheer desperation I do the one thing that will end it all without anymore hurt or pain. All I ever wanted was love but its now the one thing I cant ever have. It has destroyed me and I have nothing left to give." />
