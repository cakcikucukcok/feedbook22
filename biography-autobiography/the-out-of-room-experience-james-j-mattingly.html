  <title>The out of Room Experience - James J. Mattingly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Journey of Introspection
The Out of Room Experience gives autobiographical account of one mans internal struggles
In his new autobiography, The Out of Room Experience: Based on: The Forgotten Notes, James J. Mattingly shares the story of how he rose from the depths of despair, reconciled with his inner demons and became the man he wanted the world to see  both inside and out.
Culled from Mattinglys deeply personal journal entries, The Out of Room Experience fearlessly reveals the depression and negative thinking that kept Mattingly trapped in what he refers to as an immaterial room; one that existed only within his own mind. Persistent self-doubt and feelings of alienation made him a captive in this imaginary room despite his efforts to convince family and friends that everything was alright. 
Mattingly knows hes not alone in his experience. Insecurity, fear and confusion have always been human characteristics, and they dont disappear overnight. Rather than attempt to rid himself completely of these natural personality traits, Mattingly instead focuses on managing them to find balance in his life. 
Ive always appeared to be a normal, down to earth person living the everyday life, the author states. But theres always been and, in part, still is, this nagging thought process that seems to live on my shoulder tempting me to despair and tempting me to separate from reality in a way which damages my intellectual, emotional and relational life. 
The Out of Room Experience shares valuable coping techniques that readers from all walks of life can relate to and apply to their own circumstances." />
