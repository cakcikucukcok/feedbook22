  <title>BRAVE - Rose McGowan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; BESTSELLER - A revelaing memoir and empowering manifesto - As featured in Ronan Farrow&#39;s CATCH AND KILL and Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey&#39;s SHE SAID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;One of the greatest tricks that the patriarchy plays on women is to deliberately destabilize them, then use their instability as a reason to disbelieve them. Much of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;BRAVE&lt;/em&gt; reads like the diary of a woman driven half-mad by abusive men who assume no one will listen to her. In this case, the truth was finally&amp;#8212;and, for McGowan, triumphantly&amp;#8212;exposed...&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;BRAVE&lt;/em&gt; works beautifully as a manifesto. It&amp;#8217;s a call to arms&amp;#8212;not just against the specific men who mistreated McGowan and the men and women who enabled that mistreatment, but against an industry.&quot;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose McGowan was born in one cult and came of age in another, more visible cult: Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a strange world where she was continually on display, stardom soon became a personal nightmare of constant exposure and sexualization. Rose escaped into the world of her mind, something she had done as a child, and into high-profile relationships. Every detail of her personal life became public, and the realities of an inherently sexist industry emerged with every script, role, public appearance, and magazine cover. The Hollywood machine packaged her as a sexualized bombshell, hijacking her image and identity and marketing them for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood expected Rose to be silent and cooperative and to stay the path. Instead, she rebelled and asserted her true identity and voice. She reemerged unscripted, courageous, victorious, angry, smart, fierce, unapologetic, controversial, and real as f*ck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRAVE&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is her raw, honest, and poignant memoir/manifesto&amp;#8212;a no-holds-barred, pull-no-punches account of the rise of a millennial icon, fearless activist, and unstoppable force for change who is determined to expose the truth about the entertainment industry, dismantle the concept of fame, shine a light on a multibillion-dollar business built on systemic misogyny, and empower people everywhere to wake up and be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRAVE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My life, as you will read, has taken me from one cult to another. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRAVE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the story of how I fought my way out of these cults and reclaimed my life. I want to help you do the same.&quot; -Rose McGowan&lt;/p&gt;" />
