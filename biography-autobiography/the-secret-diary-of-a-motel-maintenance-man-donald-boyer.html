  <title>The Secret Diary of a Motel Maintenance Man - Donald Boyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost every day theres excitement going from one place to another. Theres  been so many things happening here that I really dont know where to begin.  If you look at the place as a jam packed full container of messed up people that cant get along with themselves, let alone anyone else, you would see very clearly that waiting for something to happen is a given at any time of the day.  
Its like watching one of those day time shows that can carry over a phone call from Monday to Friday and maybe they will think of something that will some how cause them to get tired of that crazy bitch that everyone across America knows is a lying, conniving, self centered trouble maker that will stop at nothing to disrupt everyones lives that she touches. 
Well we have them here too, but their twice as good at it than they are on TV.  Im going back a few days to some real excitement.  Some illegal Mexicans were staying here and one of them decided to try to rape a 16 year old girl in her own room. He was high on something and really did cause some problems. 
It was about 4 pm when he just walked in her room and pushed her down on her couch and told her in Spanish that he was going to rape her because she was a hoer and she deserved it. Shes just a young girl with a baby and shes not in any way a hoer. Then she started screaming and her mother just walked around the corner and into the room to see what was going on. 
The crazed man then went after her and knocked her down. Well, that was a major mistake on his part. She pushed the crazed man out the door and told him never to come back. He just came back in and attacked the mother again. Then some of her teenaged kids saw what was going on and decided to fight the man. 
Well, then the crazed man ran out the door and down the stairs to the parking lot and ran around the building by the laundry which was another mistake on his part.  The mother of the girl hollered to them to catch that man as he ran by the door.  Well there are some really crazy women down in the laundry room that would like nothing more that to tear into someone like this asshole. Now for his third mistake, he tried to run rite past these crazy laundry girls thinking that they were just watching and would do nothing to him.  AAAA, wrong answer..
As he approached Rosy, he didnt expect her to kick him in his legs and knock him off his feet. He was so high on dope that he didnt even know he was on the ground but he was still running his feet as she tackled him. At that point, he got up and started running again. Now, along comes our littlest laundry lady that was raised with big brothers that used to beat her up until she got older.  As the man got close to her, she did a fast knock down on him. He went down faster that a stake in front of a bull dog. When I first saw her, she was holding him down like a roped steer at a rodeo.  When I asked her if she needed any help, she told me to just stand back so I dont get hurt so she could handle piece of shit until the cops got there.      And I was just about to make my move too..." />
