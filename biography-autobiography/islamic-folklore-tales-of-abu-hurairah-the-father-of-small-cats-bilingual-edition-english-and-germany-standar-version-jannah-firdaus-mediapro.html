&lt;br /&gt;
One day, his yearning to meet Allah intensified. While his visitors were invoking Allah to cure him of his disease, he was imploring Allah saying, &amp;quot;O Allah, I love to meet You, so love to meet me.&amp;quot; In AH 59, he died at the age of 78. His calm body was buried in a blessed place among the reverent inhabitants of Al-Baqii.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Returning from his funeral, the people kept reciting many of the traditions that he had taught them about the noble Messenger. One of the recent Muslims asked his friends, &amp;quot;Why was our deceased sheikh called Abu Hurairah?&amp;quot; His knowing friend answered, &amp;quot;In the preislamic time his name was `Abd Shams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he embraced Islam, the Messenger called him `Abd Ar-Rahman. He used to be sympathetic towards animals. He had a cat that he used to feed, carry, clean, and shelter, and it used to accompany him as if it were his shadow. Thus, he was called Abu Hurairah, which means father of the small cats. May Allah be pleased with him.&amp;quot;" />
