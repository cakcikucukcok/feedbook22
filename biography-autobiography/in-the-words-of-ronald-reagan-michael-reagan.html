  <title>In the Words of Ronald Reagan - Michael Reagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As one of the greatest presidents of the twentieth century, Ronald Wilson Reagan succeeded in renewing pride in America, strengthening the principles of family, faith, and freedom on which this nation was founded, and restoring our hope for the future. President Reagan endeared himself even to his political opponents with his self-effacing wit and irrepressible optimism. Inspiring, thoughtful, and at times downright funny, he had an amazing gift for stirring emotion, sparking debate, and calling a nation to action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;In The Words of Ronald Reagan&lt;/em&gt;, now in trade paper, his oldest son Michael Reagan has gathered a wonderful collection of his father&#39;s public and private words, providing a close-up portrait of our fortieth president. From hilarious one-liners to eloquent letters to intimate family moments, these selections depict Ronald Reagan in all his many roles-as world leader, conservative icon, orator, actor, and father. Complemented by Michael Reagan&#39;s personal and insightful commentary on his father&#39;s life, &lt;em&gt;In The Words of Ronald Reagan&lt;/em&gt; will delight you, inspire you, and motivate you to finish the job Ronald Reagan began-the job of rebuilding the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;" />
