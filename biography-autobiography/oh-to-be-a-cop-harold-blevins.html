  <title>“Oh, to Be a Cop” - Harold Blevins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Synopsis
This book is about the experiences encountered when I was a sheriff for Los Angeles County. It is meant to inform those who may be entering the field and wish to gain a hands-on narrative of some of the real happenings of one who has been in the field as opposed to reading about it in textbooks. It shows reactions and ways of dealing with similar situations by various deputies who come to the crime scene. It was also written for the general public who see law enforcement from a different perspective and can also gain an insight from both sides of the picture. I also wanted to leave a legacy for other law enforcement officers that I have worked with who dedicated their lives to helping people day in and day out." />
