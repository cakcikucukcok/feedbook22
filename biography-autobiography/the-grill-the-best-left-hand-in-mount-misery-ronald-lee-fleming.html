Book Review by Dona B. Shelton-Wiggins Hey Ron, I just finished a blended family. I finished Mount Misery on Tuesday. I loved the trip down memory lane, some of the names and things made me weep, but it was a good weep for they are memories that no one can touch. It was a very good book and I am glad you have become the successful man that you are. Now on to a blended family.. oohhh I wanted to choke the life out of Charles Jr. and his Momma. I loved that novel as well. I couldnt stand Wanda and her momma wanted to beat them as well. I loved Edgar &amp; his family. I especially enjoyed how you paid homage to Papa Wongs as the Chinese restaurant. Keep up the good work. And may God continue to bless you...whew....love ya

Book Review by Dana Doggett 
Ron, I enjoyed the Grill! Nice story of your life all the way to the ending. Very well written. Brought back a lot of good memories of people from our childhood and teenage years. Was nice to see names of people that I forgot and that brought back good memories also. If I didnt grow up with you I would have still enjoyed your story. The author tells a wonderful story and I am proud to say I know him! A must read for all you FB friends and for anyone...
