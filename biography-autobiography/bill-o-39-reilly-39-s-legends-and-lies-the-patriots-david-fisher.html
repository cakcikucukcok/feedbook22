  <title>Bill O&#39;Reilly&#39;s Legends and Lies: The Patriots - David Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The must-have companion to Bill O&#39;Reilly&#39;s historical docudrama &lt;i&gt;Legends and Lies: The Patriots&lt;/i&gt;, an exciting and eye-opening look at the Revolutionary War through the lives of its leaders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Revolution was neither inevitable nor a unanimous cause. It pitted neighbors against each other, as loyalists and colonial rebels faced off for their lives and futures. These were the times that tried men&#39;s souls: no one was on stable ground and few could be trusted. Through the fascinating tales of the first Americans, &lt;i&gt;Legends and Lies: The Patriots &lt;/i&gt;reveals the contentious arguments that turned friends into foes and the country into a warzone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the riots over a child&#39;s murder that led to the Boston Massacre to the suspicious return of Ben Franklin, the &quot;First American;&quot; from the Continental Army&#39;s first victory under George Washington&#39;s leadership to the little known southern Guerilla campaign of &quot;Swamp Fox&quot; Francis Marion, and the celebration of America&#39;s first Christmas, &lt;i&gt;The Patriots&lt;/i&gt; recreates the amazing combination of resourcefulness, perseverance, strategy, and luck that led to this country&#39;s creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavily illustrated with spectacular artwork that brings this important history to vivid life, and told in the same fast-paced, immersive narrative as the first &lt;i&gt;Legends and Lies, The Patriots &lt;/i&gt;is an irresistible, adventure-packed journey back into one of the most storied moments of our nation&#39;s rich history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
