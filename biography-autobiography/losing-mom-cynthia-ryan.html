  <title>Losing Mom - Cynthia Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Cynthia Ryan offers a heartfelt glimpse into the experience of losing a parent to Alzheimers disease. She shares the realities and heartbreak of her mothers experience, one that was both enhanced and complicated by their complex mother-daughter relationship and family dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shy and distant, but also independent, her mother didnt often find joy in the roles of wife and mother. The trials of a scarred childhood, marked by poverty and an alcoholic father, made true happiness elusive for her mother. On Christmas Eve of 2000, Cynthia started to see noticeable changes in her mother. A devoted grandmother, she had never forgotten to buy presents for one of her grandchildrenuntil that day. Whats more, she spent the day pouting, because the family was celebrating Christmas one day early. Over the coming months, her behavior grew increasingly erratic and forgetful; she became agitated more and more easily. Cynthia finally took her mother to the doctor, where everyones worst fears were confirmed: Alzheimers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, Cynthia shares their journey of understanding, forgiveness, blessings, healing, and renewed love. She celebrates her mothers life, even as it spiraled out of her control.&lt;/p&gt;" />
