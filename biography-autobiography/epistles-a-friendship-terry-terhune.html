  <title>Epistles: a Friendship - Terry Terhune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Epistles: A Friendship depicts a rare divinely planned friendship between two
women in the same town who wrote each other letters. This was our chosen medium
of communication.
The recurrence of Peggys breast cancer appeared in the fi fth year upon her arrival
in Corvallis, Oregon. Her goal was survival with quality of life as long as possible
to enable her daughters to survive her inevitable death and, through her deep
Catholic faith, to believe, to obey, to persevere, and to live fully until forced by
physical debilitating conditions to succumb to the disease.
The incipience of Epistles: A Friendship commenced at Mount Angel Abbey within
days of Peggys passing-the book addresses, as I perceive, her faith, obedient life,
our friendship, the impact of the recurrence, the struggle to survive, her dying
process, and the ultimate passing.
I was requested to speak at her Mass. Her letters were a treasure. The question
immediately arose: how did she endure eleven years of physical suffering, silently,
with such courage?
Cardinal Newmans prayer cited in her service is the answer. Through Peggys faith
and determined obedience, she lived, endured, and emerged the victor.
In Epistles: A Friendship, I have endeavored to depict her incredible story-my gift to Peggy, my unique friend and a legacy for her family. It was an honor to be
her friend." />
