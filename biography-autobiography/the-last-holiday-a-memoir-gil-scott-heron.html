  <title>The Last Holiday: A Memoir - Gil Scott Heron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The stunning memoir of Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner Gil Scott-Heron, &lt;I&gt;The Last Holiday&lt;/I&gt; has been praised for bringing back to life one of the most important voices of the last fifty years. Now in paperback, &lt;I&gt;The Last Holiday&lt;/I&gt; provides a remarkable glimpse into Scott-Heron&amp;#8217;s life and times, from his humble beginnings to becoming one of the most influential artists of his generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The memoir climaxes with a historic concert tour in which Scott-Heron&amp;#8217;s band opened for Stevie Wonder. The Hotter than July tour traveled cross-country from late 1980 through early 1981, drumming up popular support for the creation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. King&amp;#8217;s birthday, January 15, was marked with a massive rally in Washington.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A fitting testament to the achievements of an extraordinary man, &lt;I&gt;The Last Holiday&lt;/I&gt; provides a moving portrait of Scott-Heron&amp;#8217;s relationship with his mother, personal recollections of Stevie Wonder, Bob Marley, John Lennon, Michael Jackson, Clive Davis, and other musical figures, and a compelling narrative vehicle for Scott-Heron&amp;#8217;s insights into the music industry, the civil rights movement, governmental hypocrisy, and our wider place in the world. &lt;I&gt;The Last Holiday&lt;/I&gt; confirms Scott-Heron as a fearless truth-teller, a powerful artist, and an inspiring observer of his times.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
