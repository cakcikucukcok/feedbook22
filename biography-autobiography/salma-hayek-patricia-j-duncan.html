  <title>Salma Hayek - Patricia J. Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The long road to Hollywood success was never easy for Mexican-born beauty Salma Hayek-but it was never dull either! Starting out in her late teens starring in the Mexican hit soap opera &lt;i&gt;Teresa, &lt;/i&gt;Salma lived a comfortable life, but she wanted more. So she packed her bags and headed to Hollywood. A Mexican woman with a heavy accent who barely spoke a word of English, Salma had hurdle after hurdle to overcome. Plenty of times she came close to giving up, but she was determined to make it big in America, and after a lot of bit parts and hard work, she did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After landing a role in &lt;i&gt;Desperado, &lt;/i&gt;alongside heart-throb Antonio Banderas, the movie parts finally started coming in, including &lt;i&gt;From Dusk Till Dawn &lt;/i&gt;with George Clooney, and &lt;i&gt;Fools Rush In &lt;/i&gt;with Matthew Perry. Now, gracing the style pages of all the major magazines and working as a Revlon spokesperson, Salma is the most sought-after Latina actress in Hollywood. And that&#39;s just the beginning. She has several huge movie projects on the horizon, and continues to fight for Mexican rights as an outspoken member of the NAFTA generation. Find out all about this talented Latina actress, from her love life, to the formula of her success, to her fabulous fashion and beauty secrets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
