  <title>The Heart of the Horse, Healing the Heart of the Human - Kaarin “Nikki” Bell/Theisinger.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Horse  Connection  Interactive Riding and Assisted Riding  For Children  &amp; Adult Children At Heart!   The Inspiration for Horse Connection was inspired by my love of horses &amp; growing up in a Circus Family that encouraged my love of animals, especially Horses!
This Connection with Horses was encouraged by my parents and early in my life my grandparents who grew up with farm animals. By age seven, my Dad and Grandpa Bell, went to the local glue factory (this was 1952 and Horses then were sent to Slaugther Houses when they were old or crippled.   They came home in a Farm Trailer and  there was Dolly, who I knew was the prettiest horse I had Ever Seen!. 
During the summers of these Years,  I had the privilege to  Travel with my Parents on Polack Bros Shrine  Circus:  I had my first Horse Job  at seven years!   A loving trainer named Sonny Moore trained Dogs and ponies to work together in a Funny Way and his act was named  Sonny Moores Roustabouts.  This was more than fun it was a privilege that I  learned to  groom, water, put on harnesses and feeds these talented animals!
These Early Horse Experiences influenced my  Dream to work with Children and Horses in a way that was not Only Learning but Fun!! This book is a description and depicts Ways that  That Horses Nurture Children, Reduce theirs Fears,  Increase Confidence, and  have a New Friend to Love.. The Horse!
My parents continued to nurture my Love of Horses when they semi retired from the Circus Trapeze Life they had known for  over Fifty Years,  and  we moved into our Home in Duncanville Tx.  There a Horse Named Tinkerbell taught me to ride all over again and my high school friend Vicky &amp; I rode  all over Duncanville and surrounding places!  Tinkerbelle had one beautiful baby horse named Missy and she was a joy to help train.   Then it was time to go to college and they were  sold to wonderful families!
The Heart of the Horse,  Healing the  Heart of the Human is shown in pictures and stories throughout this book!  Enjoy the stories and hope they will touch a place in your Heart &amp; get to know the Horses in my Life  who have now helped, healed or taught many many kids and adults to not only Ride but to love and appreciate the Horse as a Healing, Understanding, and Connecting animals to our Hearts!" />
