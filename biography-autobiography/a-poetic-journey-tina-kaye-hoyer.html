  <title>A Poetic Journey - Tina Kaye Hoyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I look in the mirror and what do I see?&lt;br/&gt; 
The vision unravels of what is to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shell of a woman whose life has been taken away&lt;br/&gt; 
What does it mean to look forward to a new day?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Take me away from the life that I lead&lt;br/&gt; 
All I feel is the need to bleed&lt;br/&gt; 
The desire to see red is like hunger or greed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Unzip my skin and set my heart free&lt;br/&gt; 
Is there such a thing as a happy me?&lt;br/&gt; 
Or carrying this burden will I always be?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From fleeing for her life from a crazed boyfriend, to an accidental overdose of prescribed medications; and not to mention a life threatening cutting disorder and eight stays in mental institutions, Tina has overcome monumental obstacles to get to where she is now. Her goal with this book is to inspire, and to help others with Bipolar Disorder realize each has different challenges, but all can be managed with the proper amount of drive, persistence and desire to do so. In this book, her poetry tells the traumatic story of her battle back to reality from her living hell with all the raw emotion she was feeling along the way. Tina opens her heart and soul and pours it out before you in these pages through her intense, gut wrenching poems. You will follow Tina on her journey as she describes to you, through her poetry, what it took to return to reality. Through them you get close insight into how the Bipolar mind works, as it goes from extreme agitation to complete hopelessness and then to a manic euphoria. We hope that you will not only enjoy this book but will learn from it as well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
