  <title>Heal Thyself - Olivier M.D. Ameisen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heal Thyself &lt;/i&gt;is the paperback edition of &lt;i&gt;The End of My Addiction--&lt;/i&gt;a memoir of Ameisen&#39;s struggle and a call to action.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[This book is] the story of the dazzling discovery of a cure that could soon be within reach of all . . . you must read this book.&quot; --David Servan-Schreiber, MD, PHD, author of &lt;i&gt;Healing Without Freud or Prozac&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Anticancer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Olivier Ameisen&#39;s book was first published, Barbara Fisher noted in &lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe &lt;/i&gt;that &quot;this is not your usual memoir of addiction, degradation, and redemption.&quot; His story is indeed unusual--not because he was a brilliant cardiologist who developed a profound addiction to alcohol, or because he tried numerous treatment options and none helped. His story was the story of millions of alcoholics--until he decided to take his treatment into his own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching for a cure for his deadly disease, he happened upon baclofen, a safe muscle relaxant that had recently shown promising results in studies with laboratory animals addicted to a wide variety of substances. Ameisen experimented with increasingly higher dosages until he reached a level that left him free of &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; craving for alcohol. That was more than six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past year, a growing number of researchers and doctors have been inspired by Ameisen and begun prescribing baclofen and lobbying for wide-scale studies into how the drug works. Last spring, no less an authority than the leading medical journal &lt;i&gt;Alcohol&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and Alcoholism &lt;/i&gt;endorsed the book. Hailing Dr. Ameisen as &quot;a remarkable medical researcher,&quot; it summed up its assessment strongly and directly: &quot;This book is to be recommended.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
