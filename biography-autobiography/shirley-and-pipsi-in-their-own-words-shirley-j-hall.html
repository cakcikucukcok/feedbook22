  <title>&quot;Shirley and Pipsi...In Their Own Words&quot; - Shirley J. Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; This is a correspondence between Shirley, a single British Lesbian, living in Spain and Sylvia, (known always as Pipsi) a married woman and mother of two college-age sons, living in Long Island, NY.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Selections from their letters and audio cassette tapes exchanged between August 1971 and June 1972 show their growing affection and love before ever having met!
Unlike today where instant communication is available to us worldwide in the form of email., Ipods and cell phones, telephone access was very limited in many parts of Spain in 1971 and 1972. Communication was limited to postal services.
(The original correspondence, when copied, consists of at least 1200, singles spaced typed pages! they kept the postal services on each side of the Atlantic in business!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This correspondence led to a life  change for them both.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
Shirley and Pipsi...In Their Own Words is nominated and became a finalist in two categories in the Golden Crown Literary Society&#39;s Fifth Annual Rewards Ceremony held in Orlando Florida in July 2009.
