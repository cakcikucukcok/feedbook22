  <title>Medical Madness - George Huber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE: There have been an increasing number of articles and books by medical professionals warning us of the hospital dangers, but very few by patients based on their personal experience. This I will guarantee; your awareness of my experience will drastically change your perception of our medical service.  You will be less certain, less trusting, more perceptively critical, but safer.  Hospitals kill 100,000 patients per year mostly through unintended medical errors. Medical complications following my routine procedure were so severe it resulted in horrific corrective measures exposing me to months of accumulated hospital treatment.  The book portrays vividly and honestly how one is more likely to be killed in the hospital than anywhere else on the planet. So read on! 
That makes the hospital, our haven of wellness, the most dangerous institution in the world.    The life you save may be your own  or one even more precious to you.   I was fortunate (lucky enough) to survive five major surgeries, with complications, in as many years.  This book describes my experience in vivid detailwith essential recommendations regarding what you need to know and do for those you care for before you become a patient." />
