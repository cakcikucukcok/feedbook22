      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “CROWDSOURCING: Why the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business” by Jeff Howe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeff Howe is a contributing editor at Wired magazine. He has been a professional journalist for fifteen years and has been a senior editor at Inside.com as well as a writer at the Village Voice. In his current assignment with Wired magazine, Mr. Howe covers the entertainment industry and other subjects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Crowdsourcing, Jeff Howe explains that “crowdsourcing” is the act of taking a task traditionally performed by a designated agent (such as an employee or a contractor) and outsourcing it by making an open call to an undefined but large group of people. Crowdsourcing allows the power of the crowd to accomplish tasks that were once the province of just a specialized few. Or to put it another way, crowdsourcing is to take the principles which have worked for open source software projects and apply them right across the entire spectrum of the business world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are interested in “crowdsourcing” and why the power of the crowd is driving the future of business, this book is for you." />
