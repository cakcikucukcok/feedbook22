The Mob - Stolen cars - Military - Cops - Stabbings &amp;ndash; Medical - Prison - Federal &amp;ndash; Legal - FBI &amp;ndash; Crimes &amp;ndash; you will see.&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A powerful true story of one child&amp;#39;s escape from the horrors of abuse into the sanctity of her own mind ... her only means of survival.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Living with alcoholism, and every form of abuse imaginable, she and her siblings struggle to grow up in a society that simply look the other way. The endless years of torture the family suffers bring out the real courage, determination, and strength in one child, while the other siblings seem to crumble along the way.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Facing the monsters both inside and out becomes as difficult as her eventual emergence into reality. She handles it the best way she knows how; she will stop her abuser, once and for all, for all of their sakes.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Someone has to do something - that she is sure of - and she is the only one capable of doing the deed. Never considering the consequences of her actions, she didn&amp;#39;t care. It would be worth it. They will be rid of her step-father&amp;#39;s abuse for good!&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She confronts her abuser without fear, and with the determination he was never able to beat out of her. She will become somebody in spite of him, and escape the evil little town nestled in those West Virginia hills before the Feds arrive to take it down.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One day I decided to sit down and read every one of my many journals, everything that I had ever written, from the beginning to the end. They covered my entire life, daily events, my thoughts, and most of my dreams up to the present. I have always felt the need to write, now I know why, it was all part of my healing.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They were filled with child abuse of the worst kind. Every page, every story, every pain, laid out there on paper aged with time. That was me before evolving from some embryonic state. Sadness filled my heart and I wept a long time for the little girl in my story that was never allowed to cry.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I could feel the strength and the courage that it took from all those in my past, regardless of what life had handed them.&amp;nbsp; Now, thanks to time, I can understand, and see the picture as a whole, with all the pieces of the puzzle in place.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;This is my story.&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
