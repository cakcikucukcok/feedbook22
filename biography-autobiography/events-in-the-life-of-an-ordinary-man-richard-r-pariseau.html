  <title>Events in the Life of an Ordinary Man - Richard R. Pariseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dick Pariseau reveals the excitement, adventures, and predicaments one can get into if one is afraid to miss anything, welcomes every opportunity, seeks excitement, and listens to ones poker buddies when they suggest new or unfamiliar areas to explore. He earned a PhD at night school because he thought decision makers would more readily accept his analysis if it was authored by a doctor. Denied the opportunity to play basketballhis most accomplished sportin college, he chose to play lacrosse and became a First Team All-American. Seeking an advantage over the competition at singles dances, he took dance lessons and ended up as a dance host and instructor aboard a cruise ship. Uncomfortable with the casual disrobing of the co-ed models at the university painting class, his poker buddies recommended that he get over it by spending time at a nudist camp. As an adventuresome traveler, he has sailed the Nile River and flown in a hot air balloon over the Valley of the Kings, gone hut-to-hut hiking in the Swiss Alps, and learned to throw a boomerang with the aboriginals in Cairns, Australia. Be entertained by the adventures and humorous predicaments of this ordinary man, and use it as a catalyst to document the adventures in your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
