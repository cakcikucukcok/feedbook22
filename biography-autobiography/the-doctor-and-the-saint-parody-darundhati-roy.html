  <title>The Doctor and the Saint Parody - Darundhati Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, I provide a practical solution for &quot;Annihilation of Caste&quot; from India. I also provide practical solutions for all burning socio-economic problems of India. By writing this book, I appeal to all Indians to change their surname to Gandhi irrespective of their caste, creed and religion. This will stop any caste based discrimination in India immediately. I also appeal to government of India to waive off affidavit fees to change surname to Gandhi. To help all Indians to understand my ideas, I wrote this book in form of short stories. This is an unparalleled love story between Saint Kanha Kumar (recipient of &quot;most honest Indian&quot; certificate from UN, the best orator, best PhD student, best political leader, bestselling author in India) and Dr. Kana Gayyub.  Love started in PANU Campus Hostel room. Love flourished in the demonetization bank queues. Would they be able to break the barrier of religion, politics and &quot;cash crunch&quot; and live happily ever after?" />
