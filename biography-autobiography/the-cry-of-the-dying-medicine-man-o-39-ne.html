  <title>The Cry of the Dying Medicine Man - O&#39;ne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pedro Nosa Halili was the one they called the medicine man. But he was more than that; he was a man with principles, pride, morals, and dignity. He was a giver; he gave to the needy who would knock on his door asking for a helping hand. In The Cry of the Dying Medicine Man, author Antonio Marquez Halili offers a biography of his father, a man who stood tall for his principles and for what he knew was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halili recaps his fathers life from birth in 1904 in the Philippines, a life that was full of mysteries, including how he even survived after his birth. From his formative years through university, his work as a physician, his involvement with a guerilla group in World War II, his family, and his eventual death, The Cry of the Dying Medicine Man narrates a story of successes and contributions to humankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With photos included, this biography shares the details of the life of a medicine man who confronted every hindrance and faced it as a man of dignity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
