  <title>From the Pits of Hell : to My First Miracle - Billy Lucious Leineke Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a memoir of my struggle with alcoholism and drug abuse. It is a story of a life gone wrong and almost wasted. My search for love and self affirmation through liquor, which turned into my own personal demon.
So many bottles of liquor I can&#39;t count. My death and miraculous salvation from the world of alcoholism and drug abuse. 
In my story I share many aspects in the evolution of my addiction. Until finally I started bleeding internally and was medically airlifted to a hospital that gave me a chance at living. I lost somewhere near 5 gallons of blood.
Saved by a team of healers in the form of doctors nurses and many others do I owe all my life. My memoir is meant for anyone struggling with addiction or their family and friends.
Furthermore, it is also meant for seekers of God and miracles. My death as it were is a testament to the power of salvation through God and Archangel Raphael. There is hope for all even in the grips of death. Amen." />
