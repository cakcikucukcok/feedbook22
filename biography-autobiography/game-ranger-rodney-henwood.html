  <title>Game Ranger - Rodney Henwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book should appeal to a wide range of readers, from those that have spent time working in the bush and can relate to these stories, to those still contemplating a career with wildlife. It should also appeal to the weekend and average armchair conservationist who has probably often dreamt of what it would have been like had he chosen to become a dedicated full time field officer. The book will also help give an insight into what goes on behind the scenes for those visiting a game park for their very first time. It has been written in an easy to read format, divided into individual wildlife adventures based from the authors early beginnings as a Game Ranger at a remote outpost in Northern Zululand to finally becoming Warden of Game Capture. Some of these adventures are funny and some more serious but never routine or mundane however they were always rewarding and gratifying. 
Enjoy the read!" />
