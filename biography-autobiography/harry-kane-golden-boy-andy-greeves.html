  <title>Harry Kane Golden Boy - Andy Greeves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Harry Kane – England’s Golden Boy tells the story of Harry Kane’s incredible performances for England at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where he captained his country to the semi-finals. Written by journalist and Spurs fanatic Andy Greeves, with forewords from Kane’s former Tottenham coach Chris Ramsey and club legend Les Ferdinand, the book takes a look back at the striker’s performances in all of England’s World Cup matches in Russia, which included a trio of goals against Panama and the Three Lions’ first hat-trick at the tournament since 1986. Also covered is the story of Kane’s formative years at Chingford Foundation School, his rejection by Spurs’ great North London rivals Arsenal and loan spells with the likes of Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich City and Leicester City prior to his emergence as leading light for club and country and a major contender for the 2018 Ballon d’Or. As Kane prepares to lead Tottenham Hotspur into their brand new £850m, 62,000 seater stadium, the book also takes a look at the goal-packed seasons with the Lilywhites so far, that has seen him score 140 goals for the club including 108 Premier League strikes in just 150 matches. &lt;/p&gt;" />
