  <title>Called to the Uttermost - Chara Vovou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, the author
 presents her own life story and the challenges of faith in God and commitment to her calling;
 presents her own path of destiny, which prompts the reader to examine his/her life purpose;
 demonstrates compelling reasons to support those in the mission field to fulfill the Great Commission;
 demonstrates how just one can significantly impact many; and
 demonstrates how to perform brainstorming, affinity diagramming, and life mapping exercises so the reader can more readily identify their future.
Most people search for their purpose in life and want to know they are part of something greater. Sadly, some live out their lives never having known their true purpose. Reasons for this can include fear of success, reluctance to exert the effort and work required, or not knowing how to fulfill their dream.
The purpose of this book is twofold.
This book offers one missionarys journey to destiny and demonstrates how mapping the stages of ones life from early years can help identify the future more clearly. It features various tools to finding ones gift and calling.
The American church is in transition from a traditional model to a missionary model. Many, having never served in the mission field, lack a well-defined understanding of the work of the missionary. The author bridges that gap for pastors, scholars, theologians, and laity.
This book speaks in storytelling, ministering, and teaching voices. It inspires, provokes, and challenges its reader to greater heights of faith in God and commitment to their calling. It affords the reader a greater understanding of missionary work. It inspires one to render support to those in the field, especially for those who cannot go to the uttermost parts of the world. This books message is theologically sound and culturally informed.
This book allows the readers to more clearly recognize their divine path forward as they trace their footsteps.
This literary work offers encouragement, empowerment, and guidance for pastors, scholars, theologians and laity of the Christian faith in fulfilling the obligation to go into all the world and teach the Gospel, especially to the unreached areas. It affords the reader the opportunity to examine their particular calling in faith and to move forward into the path that God has destined them." />
