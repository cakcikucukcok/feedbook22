  <title>Shades of the Moon - Eric James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The move from the City to the Suburbs was a huge change, even though I was young when it happened.  People in the suburbs were a lot different than the city and we as kids thought it was paradise.  Boy were we wrong.  Most people in this town are fake, corrupted, selfish, and overall ASSHOLES, in my opinion.  A lot of politics I wont get into but you might see some of it.
From the time I turned seventeen, to about twenty two, Ive gone threw some pretty interesting experiences.  My life entailed robbing, stealing, fighting, drugs &amp; drug dealing, alcohol, women, kidnapping, sports, and of course fighting.  Ive had my ups and downs, arrested eleven times but never locked up, so I guess Im pretty lucky, or have a very good lawyer; just had a few over nighters in a holding cell.
	My family is very close and we chill together all the time.  Id do anything for them, some not for me, but thats just the way they are.  I guess they call me the crazy one, but honestly, every family needs someone like me.  From my tales to tell, overall I wouldnt take any of it back.  I love my life and how I lived it.  I feel my past was lived to the fullest and my crew thugged it out for years.  I know that most of the trouble I got into was because of the choices I made, and even then I knew that it was the wrong path to take, but I just didnt care.  
	While these adventures where happening, I knew my life would be change for the better once I finished school and landed a good set job.  Though it seemed like it took forever, I finally did finish school and became full time at the position Id been working at for a few years.  That is when my life started.  I enjoyed being young and dumb, as they say, but now its time to grow up and become a man. 
	Ive gone through plenty of friends over the years, some lost due to changes schools or choosing different cliques in school, others lost on bad terms; sometimes I knew why and others I didnt understand.  I lost a couple very close best friends and also gained new ones.  Life is a struggle, I struggled through it but was able to surpass.  I got through the tough times, enjoyed the memorable times, and here are my stories to tell.
	This book will deliver my resume of an uncontrolled substance that almost ruined my life.  The rage and power I absorbed through fisting a persons face brought happiness to me.  Every true street fighter will tell you theyve gotten their ass kicked at least once in their life, and probably didnt like it.  I on the other hand loved it.  The more I got hit the more aggressive I became, trying to destroy anything in my path.  It became so much of an addiction that I looked for it all the time and even threw down with my own brother.  
	I loved to fight and was pretty good at it but it almost got me killed a few times.  
My stories here are all true, but some names may have been altered for confidentiality purposes.  In no way am I trying to disrespect anyone, past or present, because its a story about my life but a lot of others are involved as well.  Overall, I have been in over fifty legit street fights, mostly in a five year range and these are the main tales.  Other than fighting and the mischief Im actually a really nice person and a great athlete.  My whole life has been based around sports and my entire family is athletes, including the girls.  Though I pursued a sports career I still found myself living the Hip Hop lifestyle, which made me the person I am today.  I speak mostly of the bad experiences rather than the good because everyone has their good moments and the awful times are the juiciest.  
	I give a lot of credit to my parents for putting up with me all these years and I know what theyve done for me and I really do appreciate it.  They are the best parents any kid can ever ask for, and to put them through what I did was a horrible thing to do, so Im truly sorry.  Like the saying goes, what doesnt kill you only makes you stronger, I guess Im" />
