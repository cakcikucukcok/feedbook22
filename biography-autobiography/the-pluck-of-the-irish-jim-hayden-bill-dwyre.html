  <title>The Pluck of the Irish - Jim Hayden, Bill Dwyre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A unique anthology of 10 individuals who influenced, or were influenced by the University of Notre Dame make up the new, inspirational book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pluck of the Irish: 10 Notre Dame sports figures who made a difference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is not just about athletes. As noted in the second Foreward by the award-winning &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; sports editor &lt;strong&gt;Bill Dwyre&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some of them are famous athletes &amp;ndash; a quarterback who broke records, a running back who was a Vietnam war hero, a basketball star who pioneered race relations. There&amp;rsquo;s a story about a hall-of-fame coach, a swimmer whose accident almost left her paralyzed, a broadcaster who wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough to play sports, but excels at describing them. There are stories about Pulitzer Prize-winning authors, who explained what happened on the playing field and also why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the first profile &amp;ldquo;is the story of a priest who made sure that everyone at Notre Dame was a good person as well as a good athlete, coach, or teacher; a leader, who made a difference at his university, and all over the world.&amp;rdquo; That would be the &lt;strong&gt;Father Theodore Hesburgh&lt;/strong&gt;, who served as the president at Notre Dame over a period of extraordinary change for 35 years from 1952-87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by &lt;strong&gt;Jim Hayden&lt;/strong&gt;, himself a Notre Dame graduate, the book is aimed at middle-grade readers and up and is a fun and enjoyable read for anyone who wants to understand the positive impact that an institution like Notre Dame can have during a crucial, formative period of their lives ... and how students, staff and administrators can have a profound impact on the university they attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muffet McGraw&lt;/strong&gt;, the coach of Notre Dame&amp;rsquo;s astonishing 2018 NCAA women&amp;rsquo;s basketball championship team is profiled. Wrote Hayden, &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re not on Muffet&amp;rsquo;s team, you wish you were&amp;rdquo; and details her journey as a high school point guard from Pottsville, Pennsylvania to professional basketball and &amp;ndash; like a point guard &amp;ndash; being in charge of teaching championship basketball to young women in South Bend, Indiana.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is the son of a railroad boilermaker from Connellsville, Pennsylvania who came back to Notre Dame after serving in World War II because it &amp;ldquo;was a place where good thing happen to you.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Johnny Lujack&lt;/strong&gt; became the Heisman Trophy winner and won letters in four different sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there was the youngster from Green Bay, Wisconsin who described himself as &amp;ldquo;distinguished by flaming hair, milk-bottle glasses, and the two left feet of a nonathlete.&amp;rdquo; He wanted to go to Notre Dame because a friend of his did, and was studying the fascinating world of journalism. The &amp;ldquo;nonathlete&amp;rdquo; became the intermediary for millions who learned about sports from the typewriter of &lt;strong&gt;Red Smith,&lt;/strong&gt; one of the finest sportswriters who ever lived.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pluck of the Irish &lt;/em&gt;opens with a tribute to &lt;strong&gt;Harry Ornest&lt;/strong&gt;, who family&amp;rsquo;s contribution made this book possible. Ornest is best remembered as the owner who rescued the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League in the 1980s, but who had a lifetime of success in managing teams and enjoying sports of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It finishes with a dozen facts and anecdotes about Notre Dame, including &amp;ndash; on page 150 &amp;ndash; who wrote the &amp;ldquo;greatest of all fight songs,&amp;rdquo; the &lt;em&gt;Notre Dame Victory March&lt;/em&gt;. A great way to end an easy-to-enjoy book that not only informs, but like any good teacher, also provides inspiration and lessons which can be applied in the future by students of any age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
