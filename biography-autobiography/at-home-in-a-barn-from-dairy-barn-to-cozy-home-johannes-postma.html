  <title>At Home In a Barn: From Dairy Barn to Cozy Home - Johannes Postma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living in a barn may seem an unusual ambition, but an abandoned Minnesota dairy barn captured author Johannes Postma&#39;s imagination in 1976 and enticed him to devote years to making it his home.   This account of Postma&#39;s do-it-yourself building adventure begins with the barn&#39;s early history as the heart of a small dairy business. It then moves to the various stages of renovating the structure into a unique rural home. In addition to keeping much of the barn&#39;s beam structure exposed, Postma preserved the barn ambience by using weathered boards from some of the farm&#39;s outbuildings as wainscoting in much of the hayloft living quarters. Now he describes the interior and exterior transformation made over the course of twenty-four years.   Including images and illustrations, At Home in a Barn offers a great transformation story for all those interested in barns, the preservation of old structures, and do-it-yourself ventures." />
