  <title>Perils! - Carolyn, Jack Fleming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PERILS! is actually two books in one. One book is a collection of close calls and scary stories that actually happened to two adventuresome author-travelers. Danger lurked on the river behind the Taj Mahal! A knife-bearing Sikh came to the rescue. Catching a subway train was almost fatal during a monsoon in Japan. The intrepid couple caught a late-night jetliner, which broke in two as it landed. Seven additional stories about surprising adventures and close calls make for an exciting read! 
The second book is a manual for survival and management of serious, emergency problems during travel or at home, such as fainting, choking, and chest painwritten by one of the authors (JF) who happens, also, to be a cardiologist. 
The authors suggest a new, intriguing word, anticimoxie. Following its precepts, the reader will think ahead and will be more likely to arrive safe at hometo tell more scary stories!" />
