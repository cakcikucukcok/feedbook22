  <title>To Make the Moment Last - William E. Thrasher Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The sixties gave rise to a whole new generation of music. Led by Barry Gordys Motown Records and Al Bells Stax Records, soul music was taking the nation by storm. Any rhythm and blues band worth its salt was playing their sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Incredible Jades formed in Arkansas in 1967, this music was the fuel for their inspiration. A group of talented and energetic young black men full of dreams, the Jades played their hearts out to every local and regional venue within their reach, gradually making their mark among night clubs and social groups. What followed was a year of amazing and memorable moments for the members of the band as they made a name for themselves playing soul music in the heart of Arkansas. Now, author William Thrasher Jr., the Jades saxophonist, writes of the bands time together in 196768.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, a member of the Incredible Jades recalls the rise and experiences of the band over the course of one year in the late sixtiesthe groups amazing moment in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
