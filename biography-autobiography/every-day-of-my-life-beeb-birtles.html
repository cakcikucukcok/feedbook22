  <title>Every Day of My Life - Beeb Birtles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first book by a founding member of Little River Band: the first Australian band to achieve a gold album in the US.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;Every Day of My Life&#39; tells the remarkable tale of how Beeb Birtles, David Briggs, Graeham Goble, George McArdle, Derek Pellicci and Glenn Shorrock conquered the world - and then lost their band.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The book also documents how a young Dutch boy named Gerard Bertelkamp arrived in Adelaide, unable to speak English, and ended up in not one but two major bands: Zoot (with Darryl Cotton and Rick Springfield) and Little River Band (with Glenn Shorrock and later John Farnham).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the title suggests, Every Day of My Life is an intensely personal journey. Beeb Birtles might have lost his band but he discovered many other things along the way.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LRB&#39;s hits include &#39;Reminiscing&#39;, &#39;Help Is On Its Way&#39;, &#39;Lonesome Loser&#39;, &#39;The Night Owls&#39;, &#39;It&#39;s a Long Way There&#39;, &#39;Cool Change&#39;, &#39;Happy Anniversary&#39;, &#39;Lady&#39;, &#39;Curiosity (Killed the Cat)&#39;, &#39;Witchery&#39;, and &#39;Every Day of My Life&#39;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Due to a bizarre copyright case, Beeb Birtles can no longer make music as Little River Band. But he can tell their incredible story - and his own incredible story." />
