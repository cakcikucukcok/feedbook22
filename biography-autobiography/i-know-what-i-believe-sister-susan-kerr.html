  <title>I Know What I Believe. - Sister Susan Kerr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You know everyday we sit around and people say you should write a book!  Well I have this is it.
A three in one so to speak... the statement clearly about what I believe. I follow that up with why I believe these things to be so. And then of course there is a very get real with prayer portion of this little work.  This whole work is about reaching an unseen God that is all powerful, all knowing. Who created us all.  If you will follow the patterns shown in this little book that  you could actually read a small story at a time or a prayer a day would hopefully put a hunger in you to know the God of Creation who loved you so much that when you betrayed Him, His Holiness and His true and faithful, kind and gently love, you who sinned against Him who created you, would find a strong and living relationship with God my Father for yourself.  
It is my will as it is God&#39;s will that NONE should leave this Earth via the portal of death or any other way and find them selves in Hell for Eternity.  I mean think about that ..  Eternity is a long time and there are NO Friends there.  
No one can make these choices for you.  The decision to ask God to forgive you for your own sin is between you and God alone.  Not Mom nor Dad no Sister or Brother can make this choice for you. It is yours and yours alone.  God because He was rejected, came in the flesh of Jesus and went to a cruel undeserved death on the cross for you, because of you.....  so you could get the forgiveness  you so desperately need as do we all.  God has offered peace between you and Himself, you must come to God through Jesus His Son there just is no other way.....  Think it over but do not delay your decision..... YOUR Eternity depends upon it....
