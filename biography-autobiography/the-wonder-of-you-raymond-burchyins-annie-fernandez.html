  <title>The Wonder of You - Raymond Burchyins, Annie Fernandez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine waking up each day with an identity, a home, and a purpose in life. Now imagine that in the space of a short, impersonal judicial hearing, your identity as a father, husband, neighbor, and breadwinner are torn away, and you are left to wander among the wreckage of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As chaos surrounds you, you become painfully aware that you now have to begin all over. Friendships need to be developed. Relationships with your children need to be reset and redrawn. The new everyday normal is anything but. Your spirit needs to heal, to be recharged. Trust, hope, and the willingness to open oneself to a second chance at love and fulfillment must find their way through the hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the narrator as he details his struggle with divorce, loss, and the tug of his heart; straining to open itself to a new and loving relationship against the fear of loss again. Journey into his past, and see how the lessons he learned early in life have impacted him in ways he could never have imagined. Take a front-row seat as one man finds a sure path to happiness and a fulfilling life within the framework of a mended family fence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
