  <title>After God  ?? - Alan V. Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rudi Roth, a young professor of philosophy at the University of Vienna, began his lifelong passion of envisioning a post-theistic world centuries into the future when the Abrahamic religions had largely died out, to be replaced by a universal belief system in which the role of traditional religious beliefs had become increasingly irrelevant, having been overshadowed by natural humanist beliefs, which he termed Mega-Humanism.
For Rudi Roth, his Mega-Humanism was a type of eschatology without the traditional God, from which the transcendence of man prevailed. 
This book outlines the humanistic belief system as presented by the grandfather of Professor Roth in his research on his grandfathers doctorate thesis. It is his hope that a reading of this book will convince everyone of the need for a realistic sectarian philosophy that will eventually be adopted as a universal belief system." />
