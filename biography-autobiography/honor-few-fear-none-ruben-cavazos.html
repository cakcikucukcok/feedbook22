  <title>Honor Few, Fear None - Ruben Cavazos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stunning, never-before-told story of Ruben &quot;Doc&quot; Cavazos, international president of the Mongols Motorcycle Club &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ruben &quot;Doc&quot; Cavazos changes his clothes at daybreak, he is no longer a CAT scan technician at the University of Southern California Medical Center. He becomes the man known&amp;#8212;and, in a few special cases, feared&amp;#8212;as Doc, international president of the Mongols, the fastest-growing and most closely watched organization of its kind in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, the Mongols are a tightly knit band of brothers devoted in equal measure to the club, their fellow Mongols, and their freedom. They live to enjoy life, party, and travel the open road. Above all, they demand respect. When pushed too far, Mongols join together to push back. Just ask the Hells Angels, the Ukrainian mafia, the Mexican mafia, and the U.S. government. All have tested the Mongols&#39; resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Honor Few, Fear None&lt;/em&gt;, Doc is ready, for the first time, to share the stories of the Mongols&#39; battle to survive and thrive against incredible odds and sometimes terrible violence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doc takes you to the streets and into the bars, the secret meetings, the brawls, and the shoot-outs, all proof that if you live like a Mongol does, you must honor few, fear none.&lt;/p&gt;" />
