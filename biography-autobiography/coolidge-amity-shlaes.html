  <title>Coolidge - Amity Shlaes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amity Shlaes, author of &lt;em&gt;The Forgotten Man&lt;/em&gt;, delivers a brilliant and provocative reexamination of America&amp;#8217;s thirtieth president, Calvin Coolidge, and the decade of unparalleled growth that the nation enjoyed under his leadership. In this riveting biography, Shlaes traces Coolidge&amp;#8217;s improbable rise from a tiny town in New England to a youth so unpopular he was shut out of college fraternities at Amherst College up through Massachusetts politics. After a divisive period of government excess and corruption, Coolidge restored national trust in Washington and achieved what few other peacetime presidents have: He left office with a federal budget smaller than the one he inherited. A man of calm discipline, he lived by example, renting half of a two-family house for his entire political career rather than compromise his political work by taking on debt. Renowned as a throwback, Coolidge was in fact strikingly modern&amp;#8212;an advocate of women&amp;#8217;s suffrage and a radio pioneer. At once a revision of man and economics, &lt;em&gt;Coolidge&lt;/em&gt; gestures to the country we once were and reminds us of qualities we had forgotten and can use today. &lt;br /&gt;" />
