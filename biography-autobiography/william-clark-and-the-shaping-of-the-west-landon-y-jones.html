  <title>William Clark and the Shaping of the West - Landon Y. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Between 1803 and 1806, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark co-captained the most famous expedition in American history.  But while Lewis ended his life just three years later, Clark, as the highest-ranking Federal official in the West, spent three decades overseeing its consequences: Indian removal and the destruction of Native America.  In a rare combination of storytelling and scholarship, best-selling author Landon Y. Jones presents for the first time Clark&#39;s remarkable life and influential career in their full complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every colonial family living on Virginia&#39;s violent frontier, the Clarks killed Indians and acquired land; acting on behalf of the United States, William would prove successful at both.  Clark&#39;s life was spent fighting in America&#39;s fifty-year running war with the Indians (and their European allies) over the Western borderlands.  The struggle began with his famed brother George Roger&#39;s western campaigns during the American Revolution, continued through the vicious battles of the War of 1812, and ended with the Black Hawk War in the 1830s.  In vividly depicting Clark&#39;s life, Jones memorably captures not only the dark and bloody ground of America&#39;s early West, but also the qualities of character and courage that made him an unequalled leader in America&#39;s grander enterprise: the shaping of the West.  No one played a larger part in that accomplishment than William Clark.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;William Clark and the Shaping of the West&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable human story that encompasses in a single life the sweep of American history from colonial Virginia to the conquest of the West.&lt;/p&gt;" />
