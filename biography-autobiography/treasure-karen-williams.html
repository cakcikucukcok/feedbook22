  <title>Treasure - Karen Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Treasure is a real-life testimony to the mysterious and miraculous nature of life. It is the extraordinary true story of how the fable The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho psychically predicted what would happen to Karen Williams in real lifeat a time when she had never heard of Coelhos book. It is a story about the passion for a dream and how this passion revealed to Karen the language of signs and coincidences, which the spiritual realm uses to speak to each of us.
Living in Andalusia in southern Spain in the 1990s, Karen dreams of finding and living from her soul. One night after visiting her favorite ruin, she has a dream in which she is reborn and with this her soul quest begins.
Just as in The Alchemist, it takes her to Tarifa and Tangiers, then through a metaphorical desert, and finally to a place of pyramids in search of her treasure. But this is only the beginning of a supernatural odyssey. For a further eighteen years, Karen dedicates her whole being to the slow and sometimes incredibly painful unraveling of the true meaning of the allegory known to millions as The Alchemist.
What she discovers is far deeper and more transcendental than she ever imagined, and touches the lives of all of us who now stand at the beginning of a new millennium hoping for a new world and a new dawn." />
