  <title>Josie - Richard E. Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    This book tells the story of a survivor of World War II. With the help of a lifelong friend, a grandmother, and a devoted godmother, Josefine Kloibock was
    able to overcome years of homelessness in her tiny homeland of Austria, eventually to make a new life in America. One aspect of the war frequently
    overlooked by historians is the near idyllic period of almost five years during which Austria enjoyed an economic revival while the war raged on all sides.
    After the annexation in 1938, Austria became a part of Germany, and Adolf Hitler took good care of his homeland. Not until late 1943 did this period of the
    good life come to an end, when Austria came within range of Allied bombers based in Italy and North Africa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    It wasnt until years later that Josie came to realize the atrocities and crimes against humanity perpetrated by Nazi Germany, some on Austrian soil.
