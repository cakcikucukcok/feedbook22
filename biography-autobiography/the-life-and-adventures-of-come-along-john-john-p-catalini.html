  <title>The Life and Adventures of Come-Along John - John P. Catalini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As far back as he could remember, John had always been late. For breakfast, for school, even for Sunday afternoon rides with his parents and older brother to get ice cream cones  he was last in line. Behind his younger brother, too.
	His mother had to hurry him so often, she got tired of saying, Come along, John.  For his ninth birthday, John got a greeting card from his brother with those words on the envelope, and the nickname stuck. 
	Life in 1950, Fitchburg, Massachusetts, was certainly an adventure for John. From meeting Red Sox legend, Ted Williams, to escaping an oncoming train on the Bridge over Nashua River, Come-Along John may have arrived late, but he always seemed to get there just in the nick of time!" />
