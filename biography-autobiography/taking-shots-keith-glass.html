  <title>Taking Shots - Keith Glass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bring a family of four to an NBA game today, and it costs around $500 to watch a bunch of seven-footers take bad shots. Perhaps the quote often attributed to P.T. Barnum is true&amp;mdash;there really is a sucker born every minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NBA is in trouble. And as NBA agent Keith Glass describes it&amp;mdash;he&#39;s part of the problem! If team owners are willing to throw millions of dollars his way for marginal players, why should he be the only one with the self-restraint to say &quot;no&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his insightful, funny, and often mind-numbingly bizarre tales of life in the NBA over the last twenty- five years, Keith Glass lets it fly from half-court. He&#39;ll tell you how we got to the present state&amp;mdash;where an agent who makes millions off the game can&#39;t sit through one; why our NBA stars couldn&#39;t capture Olympic gold; and why the game he loves is in dire need of help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass has seen it all as the representative of players like Mark Eaton, the seven-foot-five center found working as a mechanic because he hated basketball; Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, who converted to Islam and brought the wrath of the league upon him when he refused to stand for the National Anthem; and first-round draft pick Quincy Douby, who was forced to enter the draft before graduating from Rutgers because of the harsh NCAA rules regarding college eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With informative chapters such as &quot;How to Feed Your Family on Only $14 Million a Year,&quot; &quot;Eighty-one Feet of White Centers,&quot; and &quot;From 6&#39;11&quot; to the 7- Eleven,&quot; Glass shatters the myth of NBA marketing: that everything about the game is great, and that as long as the fans in the luxury boxes are happy and weighed down with expensive merchandise, all is well. But have no fear! Keith Glass doesn&#39;t preach about the evils of highlight film slam-dunks&amp;#8212;he&#39;ll just have you falling down laughing as he flagrantly fouls the league that was once the envy of the pro sports world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
