A behind-the-scenes look on the making of his most famous and infamous movies, talking to the people closest to him, from actors and directors to those he has encountered during his trips to the dark side. &quot;I&#39;ve always felt like an outsider in this industry. Because I&#39;m so insane I guess.&quot; - Robert Downey Jr. Robert Downey Jr&#39;s life isn&#39;t a movie - but it could be. Now one of the biggest box office stars in the world thanks to Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes, he&#39;s come a long way since his early days as a rising actor amidst the Brat Pack of the Eighties, as well as stints on Saturday Night Live and Ally McBeal. His incredible journey has also encompassed prison and drug addiction - experiences which left him just one bad choice away from death. Funny, definitive and entertaining, this is the first book that dares to glimpse inside the psyche of a brilliant and complex icon of our times." />
