  <title>Where the Monster Weights - Corinne Weber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Corinne Weber was growing up in a close-knit upper middle class family with her twin brother as her best friend. But her life takes a dramatic turn when she is eight years old and her family moves to Singapore. The move catapults her into an ocean of change. She walks in to her home one day to find blood splattered across the bathroom floora telltale sign of her brother&#39;s cutting. Her life becomes a dark and desolate place. If it weren&#39;t for meeting a handsome exchange student, Corinne might have ended her life. She and the exchange student become entwined at the peak of her brother&#39;s rebellion, which is evidenced by his newly inked People=Shit tattoo that is peppering the newsfeeds of social media. But when her new love moves back to the states and her brother is sent away, a series of emotional and physical triggers cause Corinne to succumb to an illness she can&#39;t define. Living in parallel universes, she pivots between loss and the long-distance love who is keeping her sane. But the compulsive thoughts inside her head reign above all else, tearing her life apart as she loses even more of what she holds dear. Caught in the unending torment of her depression, anorexia is exposed as the monster holding her hostage. Through her faith and some crazy college experiences, Corinne finds the strength she needs to claw her way back to recovery. Where the Monster Waits reveals the existence of hope and healing in the midst of tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
