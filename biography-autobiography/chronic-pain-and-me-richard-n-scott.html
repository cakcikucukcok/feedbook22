  <title>Chronic Pain and Me - Richard N Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Chronic Pain and Me&lt;/i&gt;, author Richard Scott chronicles his fourteen-year struggle with intense, chronic pain. His life changed forever on October 3, 2000, when he fell down a set of concrete and steel stairs. From that day forward, he went through many x-rays and MRIs, followed by medical device fittings and surgeries, all designed to reduce his neck and back pain. But none were successful.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The aftermath of his accident affected every facet of his lifeincluding his marriage, which began to fall apart under the stress of his constant pain. The couples friends and family saw or heard little from them for a very long time. And then one day, Richards pain specialist told him about a device called a spinal cord stimulator that had been available for about ten years that might alleviate his pain. Finally, in May of 2007, he had the procedure to implant the device, and he then became a new man. Now experiencing less pain than he had before his accident, he believed God was riding on his shoulder, giving him a brand new life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chronic Pain and Me&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one mans struggle to find a way to curtail his chronic pain and get his life back. Through his story Richard hopes readers may learn that recently developed technology may offer help to chronic pain suffers, and he urges them to never stop looking for help.&lt;/p&gt;" />
