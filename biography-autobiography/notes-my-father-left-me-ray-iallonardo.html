  <title>Notes My Father Left Me - Ray Iallonardo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes My Father Left Me&lt;/em&gt; creates a detailed sketch of a widowed father who papered his own house with notes written to himself and to anyone else who might be around. When he died, his son, Ray Iallonardo, found the notes. He then decided to combine them with his own reminiscences and comments, creating an unusual portraiture of a man who held strong opinions and who found no details too small to merit his attention. In the end, the fathers notes enabled him posthumously to become the straight man for his sons lovingly humorous and slightly sentimental musings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you find joy in seeing the deep reserves of mirth that can flow from the tiny and mundane details of life and if you enjoy seeing someones likeness emerge from a mosaic of many small tiles, then you will enjoy reading the words and viewing the images in &lt;em&gt;Notes My Father Left Me&lt;/em&gt;. When you are finished, you may find yourself tempted to post a note on the cover of this book: Keep this and read it again when I need to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;" />
