      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “CREATING AND DELIVERING TOTALLY AWESOME CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES: The Art and Science of Customer Experience Mapping” by Gary Millet and Blaine Millet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gary Millet is founder and CEO of Customer Experiences Inc., a consulting, training and application development firm. Blain Millet is partner in charge of the management consulting practice of Grant Thornton LLP. He specializes in developing competitive customer strategies and customer-centric solutions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key challenge in business is not to merely satisfy your customers but to genuinely delight them on a consistent and repeatable basis. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the authors explain in this book, when customers are delighted, they become more loyal to your business and they will go out of their way to recommend you to their friends and associates. Furthermore, you differentiate yourself from all your competitors simply and powerfully and you lower your marketing and product development costs – because loyal customers will tell you what they really want and need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In essence, any organization’s immediate success and long-term viability depends entirely on the quality of the relationship formed with each individual customer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creating and Delivering Totally Awesome Customer Experiences is a great book which gives you all the recipes necessary to develop customer relationships and loyalty.&lt;br&gt;" />
