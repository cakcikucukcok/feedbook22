  <title>My Soul Cried Out...But I Could Not Weep - Elisabeth Holyday</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: &quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;&gt;A small town country girl from humble beginnings with a passion for music and church is trapped for decades with a traumatic secret that changed the direction of her life. This playful happy-go-lucky little girl who once indulged in solving arithmetic that went far beyond her tender age; and running home from school to get to the Wednesday night Prayer Meetings, now gives a refreshingly tasteful view of life at home with her mother and siblings - rich in love though shadowed with poverty. The extent she went to spare her mother from more heartache when she faced her worst nightmare, is a testament to her resounding strength to protect her mother at all cost; but it wasnt enough to shield her from the effects of what her silence would cost her in the years ahead. At times its like a story out of a fiction movie, unfortunately, its not. It is the story of a real person - a mother who is forced to share her story so her children can finally know the truth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: &quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;&gt;Tumultuous, yet inspiring, every ounce of this soul was put to the test but her faith withstood them all. The courage to always get up and keep going despite obstacles, and the determination to survive not so much for herself, but for her children and her mother; makes this a book for every mother, daughter, and sister. It can only be concurred that the loving bond Elisabeth had with her Mom, and the love she got in return, along with everything she learned in Church and Sunday school, shaped and moulded this precious soul for the unimaginable road she would walk ALONE.
