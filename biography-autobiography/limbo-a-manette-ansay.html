  <title>Limbo - A. Manette Ansay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From childhood, acclaimed novelist A. Manette Ansay trained to become a concert pianist. But when she was nineteen, a mysterious muscle disorder forced her to give up the piano, and by twenty-one, she couldn&#39;t grip a pen or walk across a room. She entered a world of limbo, one in which no one could explain what was happening to her or predict what the future would hold. &lt;p&gt;At twenty-three, beginning a whole new life in a motorized wheelchair, Ansay made a New Year&#39;s resolution to start writing fiction, rediscovering the sense of passion and purpose she thought she had lost for good. &lt;p&gt;Thirteen years later, still without a firm diagnosis or prognosis, Ansay reflects on the ways in which the unraveling of one life can plant the seeds of another, and considers how her own physical limbo has challenged&amp;#8212;in ways not necessarily bad&amp;#8212;her most fundamental assumptions about life and faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luminously written, &lt;em&gt;Limbo&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant and moving testimony to the resilience of the human spirit." />
