  <title>Billy Mitchell (Annotated) - Emile Gauvreau, Lester Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As early as 1920, US Army General Billy Mitchell began sounding alarm bells about an inevitable Japanese invasion from sea-based aircraft. Through the press and in person he lobbied naval brass about America&amp;#39;s woefully unprepared defensive air power but his talk of dogfights over the Pacific with superior planes was laughed at and dismissed by all. Mitchell&amp;#39;s vision of a US Air Arm would have meant massive, costly upgrades to the nation&amp;#39;s dated flying machines owned by private firms holding patents on aircraft machinery. Old guard soldiers, like John J. Pershing, dismissed as delusional ravings Mitchell&amp;#39;s belief that a battleship could be destroyed by a bomber. Mitchell&amp;#39;s outspoken press conferences about an airplane trust supported by corrupt government officials led to his court-martial for insubordination in 1925. He died in 1936, a man ahead of his times.&lt;br /&gt;
