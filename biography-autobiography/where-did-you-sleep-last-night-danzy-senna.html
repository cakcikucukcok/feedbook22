  <title>Where Did You Sleep Last Night? - Danzy Senna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Danzy Senna&#39;s parents got married in 1968, they seemed poised to defy history. They were two brilliant young American writers from wildly divergent backgrounds--a white woman with a blue-blood Bostonian lineage and a black man, the son of a struggling single mother and an unknown father. They married in a year that seemed to separate the past from the present; together, these two would snub the histories that divided them and embrace a radical future. When their marriage disintegrated eight years later, it was, as one friend put it, &quot;the ugliest divorce in Boston&#39;s history&quot;--a violent, traumatic war that felt all the more heartrending given the hopeful symbolism of their union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades later, Senna looks back not only at her parents&#39; divorce but beyond it, to the opposing American histories that her parents had tried so hard to overcome. On her mother&#39;s side of the family she finds--in carefully preserved documents--the chronicle of a white America both illustrious and shameful. On her father&#39;s she discovers, through fragments and shreds of evidence, a no less remarkable history. As she digs deeper into this unwritten half of the story, she reconstructs a long buried family mystery that illuminates her own childhood. In the process, she begins to understand her difficult father, the power and failure of her parents&#39; union, and, finally, the forces of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where Did You Sleep Last Night? &lt;/i&gt;is at once a potent statement of personal identity, a challenging look at the murky waters of American ancestry, and an exploration of narratives--the narratives we create and those we forget. Senna has given us an unforgettable testimony to the paradoxes--the pain and the pride--embedded in history, family, and race.&lt;/p&gt;" />
