  <title>Never Give Up: Buddhism, Family &amp; Schizophrenia: One woman&#39;s story of hope and courage. - Jennifer L Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A great human revolution in just a single individual will help achieve a change in the destiny of a nation and, further, will enable a change in the destiny of all humankind.&quot;   - SGI President Daisaku Ikeda  In August 2011, Jennifer Myers created a blog to chronicle her daily experiences dealing with the symptoms of a mental illness she was diagnosed with in 2002: schizophrenia. This diagnosis was based on the symptoms Jennifer described to psychiatrists: hearing disembodied voices (auditory hallucinations), paranoia, believing that she was being persecuted by the mafia and followed around from one place to another by other people. In reality, Jennifer never believed that the &quot;voices&quot; she heard were merely symptoms of schizophrenia. Instead, she believed (and still believes) that a form of communication which has never been scientifically proven - telepathy - was what allowed her to hear the &quot;voices&quot; of her enemies in her head, and which also allowed her enemies to &quot;hear&quot; her thoughts.   These unusual and utterly bizarre set of circumstances, combined with the demented insanity of everyone involved created a horrific set of circumstances for Ms. Myers, her husband and their families. Ultimately, the situation devolved into chaos for the people and the surrounding communities who were forced to become involved.   Jennifer challenges her circumstances and finds hope, courage and strength in her Buddhist practice. She turns to her husband and family for love and support. Her writing and her photography are her creative outlets and emotional therapy. Jennifer never gives up in her fight. Her memoir is a source of hope, inspiration, and encouragement. Jennifer lives with her husband and a small, black terrier in the San Francisco Bay Area. To follow Jennifer&#39;s blog visit: www.SundanceKidOnline.com" />
