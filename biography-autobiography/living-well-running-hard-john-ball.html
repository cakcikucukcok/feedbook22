  <title>Living Well, Running Hard - John Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1983, John Ball was almost at a midpoint in his lifea time to assess the first half before he carried on with the second. It was then that he had to deal with the diagnosis of Parkinsons disease, just before he turned forty years old. In this memoir, Ball narrates his story of how he has lived with Parkinsons disease and how he has worked to create a better life for others struggling with difficult diagnoses and debilitating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Living Well, Running Hard&lt;/i&gt; offers insight into Balls growth from isolation into a leadership role in the Parkinsons community. His long struggle to understand the disease provides an in-depth look at the complexities of Parkinsons. Ball tells how his transition was triggered by a childhood desire to run a marathon and how his love of running, his desire to take action, and his willingness to take on challenges come together in the formation of Team Parkinson. In spite of his diagnosis, Ball has continued to run the Los Angeles Marathon each of the last fifteen years.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Intimate and inspiring, &lt;i&gt;Living Well, Running Hard&lt;/i&gt; communicates one mans story of perseverance and triumph.&lt;/p&gt;" />
