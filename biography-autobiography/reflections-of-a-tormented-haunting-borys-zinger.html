  <title>Reflections of a Tormented Haunting - Borys Zinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The poems in this book vary in subject. Some recount the diffi cult and
dangerous experiences during their escape through Poland into Russia,
where he met and married my mother, Rose. Many describe the terrible
tragedies that transpired during the horrible holocaust, in which his
two sisters and brother were brutally murdered by the Nazi regime.
There are several poems which talk about nature, science, space and the
All-Mighty. Here the poet wrestles between different ideas, to decide
who is behind the creation and why was there a Holocaust, but a real
answer is not available. A number of his poems talk about his friends
and memorable fi gures from his past and history. Other poems depict
the hardships of old age, in all its forms, and the preciousness of youth,
which is lost and so envied. Yes, Borys is also a romantic, because there
are some nice poems which any young lady would have been pleased
to receive. A sad and special poem, A Pink Slip, describes how
my mothers breath of life was cruelly swept away by the establishment.
