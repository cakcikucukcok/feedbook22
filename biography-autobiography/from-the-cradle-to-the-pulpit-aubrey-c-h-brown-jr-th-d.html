  <title>From the Cradle to the Pulpit - Aubrey C.H. Brown Jr. Th. D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story we are about to embark upon is not just a historical event that was stored in the mental archives of the writers imagination. Rather, it is the solid collection of indisputable facts. These facts are the pillows of truth that have guided a chosen vessel of God toward his vocational occupation. This book is a synopsis of the writers life, from the cradle to the pulpit. This story is based on a biological sketch of the writers childhood, to include his family background, community description, early education, and religious upbringing. 
His conversion to Christianity and call to the pastoral ministry was the turning point of his adult life. He was now moving on a particular uncertain course, not willing to quietly surrender to the will of God and heed the call to the pulpit ministry. This was the time of his life when he sought to avoid pastoral obligations by attempting to ponder in the field of journalism. This was, of course, the treading upon dangerous grounds that would subsequently provoke the one who requires his service to take serious action to implore his indulgence." />
