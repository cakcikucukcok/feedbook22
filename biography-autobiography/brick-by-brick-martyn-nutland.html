  <title>Brick by Brick - Martyn Nutland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The myth that Alec Issigonis conceived the Mini is just one whisp of the smoke screen that obscures the untold story of post-War Britains greatest industrialist.
This is more than a motoring story.
You will find commentary on life in the first half of the 20th century as you explore the drama of one mans determination to overcome adversity. Someone who shot from the hip as no other tycoon. 
This is a tale of political and military intrigue. Of spectacular business acumen. Of bitter, violent, industrial conflict.
An account of savage jealousies and sexual intrigue. 
To record the life of Leonard Lord the author has visited a vast number of sources.
In recent times some have sought to implant the roots of the British motor industrys ills and ultimate collapse in the policies of Leonard Lord. This is both disingenuous and unjust. 
This, for the first time, is his story." />
