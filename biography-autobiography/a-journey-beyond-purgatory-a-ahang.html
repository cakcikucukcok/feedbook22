  <title>A Journey Beyond Purgatory - A. Ahang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Early in the year 1980, a year after Khomeini took power, a group of army
and air force officers participated in a coup to overthrow the newly established
Islamic Republic of Iran. The plot was discovered a day before its execution, and in
a frenzy, the government captured thousands of suspects from all over the country
and flooded the prisons with army and air force personnel as well as many civilians.
A few days after interrogating the captured, they continued to arrest thousands
of suspects; many of them were innocents, who had nothing to do with the coup.
Hundreds of those officers were executed, and the rest were kept in prison for a
long period of time.
This is the story of one of the innocent men whose crime was his close friendship
with two of the army officers and was accused of being a part in the plot against the
government. One early morning, a dozen of revolutionary guards invaded his house
and took him away. During his six-month captivity, he was kept in solitude, was
abused and tortured physically and mentally, and was moved from town to town to
different prisons. His family and friends were kept unaware of his whereabouts, and
members of his family were given the opportunity to pay him a visit only in the last
month of his captivity.
Among all those men, he was one of the lucky ones who were released and
returned to the society, but he never had a normal life afterward. This is his
horrifying experience in the prison of a fundamentalist religious regime" />
