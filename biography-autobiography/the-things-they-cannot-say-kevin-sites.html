      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is it like to kill? What is it like to be under fire? How do you know what&amp;#39;s right? What can you never forget?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Things They Cannot Say&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning journalist and author Kevin Sites asks these difficult questions of eleven soldiers and marines, who&amp;#8212;by sharing the truth about their wars&amp;#8212;display a rare courage that transcends battlefield heroics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each of these men, many of whom Sites first met while in Afghanistan and Iraq, the truth means something different. One struggles to recover from a head injury he believes has stolen his ability to love; another attempts to make amends for the killing of an innocent man; yet another finds respect for the enemy fighter who tried to kill him. Sites also shares the unsettling narrative of his own failures during war&amp;#8212;including his complicity in a murder&amp;#8212;and the redemptive powers of storytelling that saved him from a self-destructive downward spiral.&lt;/p&gt;" />
