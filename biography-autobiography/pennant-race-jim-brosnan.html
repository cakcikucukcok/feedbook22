  <title>Pennant Race - Jim Brosnan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Brosnan obviously knows his baseball, writes about it wittily, informally and with irony. He is a cynical, tough professional athlete and his book makes wonderful reading.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the author of &lt;em&gt;The Long Season&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;considered by many to be the greatest baseball book of all time&amp;#8212;comes another classic sports memoir by legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan, which chronicles how his team, the Cincinnati Reds, went on to win the 1961 National League pennant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Pennant Race&lt;/em&gt;, Brosnan&amp;#8212;with his trademark wise-guy wit and plain-spoken practicality&amp;#8212;once again offers a refreshingly candid alternative to hackneyed baseball mythologizing. Day by day, game by game, Brosnan reveals the real lives of professional ballplayers: their exhilaration and frustration, hope and despair, chronic worry over job security, playful camaraderie, world-weary cynicism, and boyish&amp;#8212;if cautious&amp;#8212;optimism. Although the Reds would ultimately lose the World Series to the Yankees, for Brosnan and his teammates, this was a winning season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pennant Race&lt;/em&gt; vividly captures a remarkable year in the life of a ball club and the golden age of one of Major League Baseball&amp;#8217;s most memorable eras.&lt;/p&gt;" />
