      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This memoir presents author Elvin Bells recollection of his own history and of his encounters with some of the most well-known movers and shakers of the times. He provides us with astonishing revelations based upon his discussions, meetings, and casual conversations with them. The Event Makers Ive Known shares incredible close-ups of everyone from President Richard Nixon and his secretary, Rosemary Woods, to Elvis Presley and screen siren Marilyn Monroe. Bell reveals shocking details of the love affair between Woods and the Interior Secretary and describes the impetuosity of General William Westmoreland, among other stories.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In addition to sharing stories of the famous people he has known, he tells his own personal stories, including the tragic story of his grandmothers death within just a few minutes of his mothers birth in a fire that engulfed the hospital in flames. He talks about the daring rescue of his mother by the young doctor who delivered hera rescue that cost the doctor his eyesight, his occupation, and eventually his life. He also shares fascinating stories of the hardships, ingenuity, and perseverance that many parents and grandparents endured on their dust bowl quest to reach California.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In his tenth book, &lt;i&gt;The Event Makers Ive Known&lt;/i&gt;, Bell takes readers on an emotional roller-coaster ride of superstar meltdowns, victories, and heartfelt personal stories.&lt;/P&gt;" />
