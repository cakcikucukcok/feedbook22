Read his story and discover how you, too, can move toward unprecedented satisfaction through a living faith in God.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;With Barry Black, you don&#39;t just hear a sermon, you see the sermon.

The Senate and the country are grateful for his service.&quot; - BARRACK OBAMA, US Senator&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;From a wonderfully unique man comes a powerfully unique story. Barry Black is a testimony to God&#39;s faithfulness and grace.&quot; - MAX LUCADO, Pastor, Oak Hills Church, San Antonio, TX&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is an inspiring autobiography by an outstanding man of God, a great leader, a powerful preacher, and a true patriot . . .

I&#39;m honored that he succeeded me as Chaplain of the United States Senate. &lt;em&gt;From the Hood to the Hill&lt;/em&gt; is a stirring and power-packed book of the way God uses whom He chooses.&quot; - DR.
