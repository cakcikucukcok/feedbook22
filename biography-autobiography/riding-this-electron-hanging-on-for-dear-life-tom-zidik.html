  <title>Riding This Electron Hanging on for Dear Life - Tom Zidik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tom Zidik believes that we all must live our choices, learn to treat people the same, and make a difference in the lives of others.&lt;br. 
&lt;p&gt;In a memoir that weaves memories with compelling thoughts on life, teachable moments, and engaging lessons, Zidik begins by leading others through the events of his early youth and how they helped to form his character and his subsequent life. After recounting a childhood filled with milk trucks, stern nuns in Catholic school, and a few concussions, Zidik details how he met his future wife, landed a good job, and endured many challenges. While chronologically describing his varied experiences, Zidik offers an inspirational perspective of a life-changing event that provided him with insight and validity to his life, shares his thought-provoking view of the universe, and provides life lessons extracted from his own path of self-discovery.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding This Electron, Hanging On For Dear Life shares the life story of a soul searcher as he journeyed from boyhood to manhood, contemplated his place in the universe, and eventually learned to embrace his uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
