  <title>Mary Ann or Ginger - Barry Rothman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mary Ann or Ginger? Tonya or Lara? Betty or Veronica?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For boys on their way to manhood or for men on their way back to boyhood, such complex choices in women have for centuries caused men to scratch their heads and wonder who is better: the bad girl, the good girl, or a mix of both? In his entertaining memoir, professed admirer of bad girls, &lt;b&gt;Barry Rothman&lt;/b&gt;, recounts his romantic adventures over the past fifty years while exploring both the humorous and serious sides of relationships and sharing words of wisdom along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothman was five when he had his first serious brush with a member of the opposite sex. After he kissed a girls hand in the kindergarten cloakroom one day, he caused a scandal of great proportions. More importantly, however, he purposely propelled himself into the complex world of male-female interactions. From the stripper to the scary geisha and from the street urchin to a string of ballet dancers, Rothman unveils all the secrets of his lengthy and fervent journey to find a soul mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary Ann or Ginger&lt;/i&gt; reveals an inside glimpse of one mans foray into the often complex world of dating as he alluringly reflects on his amorous choices.&lt;/p&gt;" />
