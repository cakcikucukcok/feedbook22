  <title>The Adventures of Cabeza De Vaca - Judy Scalise, Tom Hayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cabeza de Vaca was looking for adventure when he helped lead a group of Spanish explorers to North America in 1528, and he certainly found it when he washed up on the shores of Texas.  Lost in the wilderness with his men and living among the Indians, he survived as a wandering merchant, a warrior-prince, a slave, a medicine man and a faith healer.             
    During his epic journey across North America he gathered up thousands of native followers as people from village after village just walked away from their homes and left all of their possessions behind in order to follow him.  He surprised the world when he came walking out of the wilderness with three of his companions and this great procession of natives after being presumed dead for nearly eight years. 
    By that time, after crossing the continent,  Cabeza de Vaca had baptized the young, laid hands on the sick, performed invasive medical surgery, ended the slave trade in central Mexico, stopped wars and generally freed people from the darkness of spiritual bondage.  His faith sustained him in even the most difficult of circumstances.  Join this fearless explorer on a compelling spiritual journey across an unexplored stone-age America." />
