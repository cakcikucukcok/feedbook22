  <title>A Young American Traveler - Albert Park</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a journey 11-years in the making, Park takes the reader on an extensive holiday to over 30 countries, friendly and hostile, exotic and metropolitan, all infused with the pleasures of life as well as the dangers of the same. 
Park sets the scene as a young undergraduate army cadet in southern California in the hopes of becoming an army officer during the Global War on Terrorism in 2003. 
His travels begin with the obligatory university euro trip, backpacking alone in the lands of the old empires and enjoying the fruits of discovery, topping off with the XXVIII Olympiad in Athens, Greece.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After commissioning into the U.S. Army, Park is stationed in Germany and expands his discoveries in Europe and also finds himself serving in Iraq and Afghanistan on almost back-to-back deployments. When not deployed, Park makes the most of his time and enjoys many new exciting experiences to include Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany; new years celebrations in Amsterdam, London, and Edinburgh; and reunites with all old friends in Italyjust to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Returning stateside, Park deploys to Haiti with &quot;Americas Guard of Honor&quot;, the 82nd Airborne Division, providing humanitarian assistance to an earthquake torn country. Park continues to expand his democratic empire by returning to Europe to run with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain; travels to Egypt to marvel at the great ancient pyramids; and treks the mystical Andes Mountains of Peru and Patagonia. 
Park then takes in the beauty and adrenaline pumping adventures of New Zealand and also meets family in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Pushing the limits, Park treks the awe-inspiring Himalayas, reaching spectacular heights and scenery during the harsh conditions of winter. Finally, he ends his travels enjoying the delicious tastes and exotic grandeur of India; forms everlasting friendships, and even succumbs to some peril in Indochina.&lt;/p&gt;" />
