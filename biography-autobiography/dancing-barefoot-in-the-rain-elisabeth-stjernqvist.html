      <meta name="description" content="Follow the story of Hope, a woman who dreams of exploring the world outside her small town in northern Sweden.
Flaunting conventions and ignoring the fears and warnings of the people around her, Hope decides to set out alone on a backpacking adventure around the world, something unthinkable for a young woman during the 80s.
Find out what happens when Hope travels through Australia, New Zeeland and the Islands of the Pacific, and then arrives in the US. Discover what happens when she continues her journey to South America and the fateful meetings she has in Guatemala.
Throughout it all, Hope will have to learn foreign cultures, a new language, and deal with unexpected friends and enemies. Discover what happens when she is forced to deal with mobsters and murderers and becomes persecuted by the law. In the end, Hope will have to go through both great love and utter disaster before she understands what it means to fully embrace life." />
