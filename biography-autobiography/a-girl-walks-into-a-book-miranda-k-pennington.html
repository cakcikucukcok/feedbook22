  <title>A Girl Walks Into a Book - Miranda K. Pennington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;How many times have you heard readers argue about which is better, &lt;i&gt;Jane Eyre &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Wuthering Heights&lt;/i&gt;? The works of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne continue to provoke passionate fandom over a century after their deaths. Brontë enthusiasts, as well as those of us who never made it further than those oft-cited classics, will devour Miranda Pennington&#39;s delightful literary memoir.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pennington, today a writer and teacher in New York, was a precocious reader. Her father gave her &lt;i&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/i&gt; at the age of 10, sparking what would become a lifelong devotion and multiple re-readings. She began to delve into the work and lives of the Brontës, finding that the sisters were at times her lifeline, her sounding board, even her closest friends. In this charming, offbeat memoir, Pennington traces the development of the Brontës as women, as sisters, and as writers, as she recounts her own struggles to fit in as a bookish, introverted, bisexual woman. In the Brontës and their characters, Pennington finally finds the heroines she needs, and she becomes obsessed with their wisdom, courage, and fearlessness. Her obsession makes for an entirely absorbing and unique read. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Girl Walks Into a Book&lt;/i&gt; is a candid and emotional love affair that braids criticism, biography and literature into a quest that helps us understand the place of literature in our lives; how it affects and inspires us.&lt;/div&gt;" />
