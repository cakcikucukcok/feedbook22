  <title>Theodor SEUSS Geisel - Donald E. Pease</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Seusss infectious rhymes, fanciful creatures, and roundabout plots not only changed the way children read but imagined the world. And to Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street, Green Eggs and Ham,The Cat and the Hat, these and other classics have sold hundreds of millions of copies and entertained children and adults for decades.   After graduating from Dartmouth, Theodor Geisel used his talents as an ad-man, political provocateur, and social satirist, gradually but irrevocably turning to childrens books. Theodor SEUSS Geisel tells the unlikely story of this remarkable transformation. In this compact and engrossing biography, Donald Pease reveals the evolution of Dr. Seusss creative persona while offering an honest appraisal of his life. The book also features many of Dr. Seusss lesser-known illustrations, including college drawings, insecticide ads, and wartime political cartoons-all of which offer a glimpse of his early artistic style and the visual origins of the more famous creatures that later populated his childrens books.   As Pease traces the full arc of Dr. Seusss prolific career, he combines close textual readings of many of Dr. Suesss works with a unique look at their genesis to shed new light on the enduring legacy of Americas favorite childrens book author." />
