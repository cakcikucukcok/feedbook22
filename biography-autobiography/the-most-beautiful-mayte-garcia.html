  <title>The Most Beautiful - Mayte Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the one-year anniversary of his death, legendary musician Prince&#39;s first wife shares a uniquely intimate, candid, and revelatory look inside the personal and professional life of one of the world&#39;s most beloved icons.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Most Beautiful&lt;/i&gt;, a title inspired by the hit song Prince wrote about their legendary love story, Mayte Garcia for the first time shares the deeply personal story of their relationship and offers a singular perspective on the music icon and their world together: from their unconventional meeting backstage at a concert (and the long-distance romance that followed), to their fairy-tale wedding (and their groundbreaking artistic partnership), to the devastating losses that ultimately dissolved their romantic relationship for good. Throughout it all, they shared a bond more intimate than any other in Prince&#39;s life. No one else can tell this story or can provide a deeper, more nuanced portrait of Prince--both the famously private man and the pioneering, beloved artist--than Mayte, his partner during some of the most pivotal personal and professional years of his career. &lt;i&gt;The Most Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; is a book that will be returned to for decades, as Prince&#39;s music lives on with generations to come." />
