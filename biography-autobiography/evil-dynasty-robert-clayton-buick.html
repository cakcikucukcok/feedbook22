  <title>Evil Dynasty - Robert Clayton Buick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Now, after completing his trilogy about the Kennedy assassinations, in which
he describes his personal knowledge and involvement, he has written a rivetingblockbuster
documentary about the family that Lucrecia and Cesare Borgia would
pale in the shadow of. The author fears not, and pulls not one punch in revealing
what the Bush Dynasty is all about. Their continual profi ting throughout the
20 and 21 Century, in the misery, fragility and helplessness of human beings,
commencing with the patriarch, Prescott Bush, who fi nanced the Hitler War
Machine during World War II, to the present day president, George W. Bush, is
well documented. The Bush familys personal and fi nancial involvement in the
collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 is a matter of public
record. Buick clearly defi nes the true relationship of the First Family to Richard
Bruce Cheney, the Vice President, and reveals the subterfuge of the Bush-Cheney
administration; from the lies to go to war in Iraq, to the unveiling of greed and
corruption of war profi teering, the outright dictatorship of no-bid contracting,
and the US Government payment to confl ict-of-interest corporations, directly
connected to Vice President Dick Cheney and to the Bush family." />
