  <title>Autobiographies - Charles Darwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Collected in this edition is the early autobiographical fragment written by Charles Darwin in 1838 along with his official autobiography which was first published in 1887, five years after his death. His controversial theory of evolution, which asserted that all of life on earth descended from common ancestors through a process of natural selection, subjected him to much criticism in his lifetime but would ultimately place him amongst the most important figures in the history of science. &quot;Autobiographies&quot; gives a personal insight into the life of Charles Darwin from his time at Cambridge University, to his landmark naturalist expedition during the voyage of the &quot;HMS Beagle&quot;, and his life that followed in England. This document of one the world&#39;s most important naturalists is a must read for any student of the history of science and gives a firsthand account of the impact that a truly revolutionary theory can have." />
