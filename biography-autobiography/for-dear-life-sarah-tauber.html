  <title>For Dear Life - Sarah Tauber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overcoming infidelity transforms first-time author into an influential woman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;In For Dear Life,&#39; Sarah Tauber openly shares an intimate and encouraging look into her life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CALIFORNIA  Oprah Winfrey. J.K. Rowling. Vera Wang. Marilyn Monroe. What do these successful and influential women have in common? They are women who failed before they succeeded. While the women who have achieved such celebrated status are few, those who have gone through similar inspiring life transformations abound; and among them is Sarah Tauber, the author who debuted with a genuine revelation in &quot;For Dear Life.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, Sarah unveils the most intimate, and probably the most challenging, phase of her life. &quot;For Dear Life&quot; recounts the story of a young American woman who lived for two years during the 1970&#39;s with her husband and their young child in Tehran, Iran. With a workaholic husband having little time or attention for his bride, she became involved with an Iranian man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although infidelity may be taboo, it is a timeless issue that both men and women have struggled with.  Sarah&#39;s affair was something many women may have experienced. Yet, it was Sarah&#39;s humble admission and firm decision to address her past that truly healed, defined and transformed her into a credible example for women today. Writing a story that most of her family and friends were unaware of was both painful and cathartic.  Today, it is this same story that offers women the gift of hope and encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw, real and radically uplifting, &quot;For Dear Life&quot; is a powerful story that runs the gamut of human emotion  happiness, sadness, fear, love, agony, remorse and eventual joy. Sarah may not be as influential as Oprah, Rowling, Vera or Marilyn, but the humility and the great strength of character that she shares with these women, as evidenced in her story, will truly earn her a special, influential place in reader&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;The choices you make in life have consequences, some ripple out to encompass other lives. You can overcome the bad choices, make better ones, and ultimately be happy again,&quot; says Sarah, speaking encouragingly to anyone who has walked that path. &lt;/p&gt;" />
