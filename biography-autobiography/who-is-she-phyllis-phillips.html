    &lt;p&gt;
        South Carolina first knew Lucy Petway Holcombe of Texas in 1857 when she chose money and power to become the bride of the long time politician, Francis
        Pickens of Edgefield.  Twenty- five years her seniorricharrogantmalicioustypically and perfectly Southern manneredFrancis had and would do
        anything necessary to satisfy his unrelenting ambition.  Until his death after the Confederate War, Lucy played her role, perfectly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Lucy was thrilled by the elaborate words of her would be governor husband when he endorsed Secession: I would appeal to the god of battles  if need
        be, cover the state with ruin, conflagration and blood rather than submit. Then, as First Lady she embraced the Cause and the War that led to the
        destruction of slaverythe state and the planter class. Loved by the people, and some said the Confederate Treasurer Menninger as well, her portrait
        was placed on one hundred and one dollar Confederate bonds while a unit of soldiers bore her worshipped name: The Holcombe Legion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In defeat Lucy and Francis returned to Edgefield.  For ten years the entire state was ruled by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags and unleashed slaves.  White
        people lived in terror.  Rebellion came in the blood letting election to name the Governor when the Confederate/Hero/General/One Time Aristocrat Wade
        Hampton -- now a widower  fulfilled his destiny by rescuing the state from Reconstruction Government.  Long admired by Lucy  even as he was her
        husbands enemy  Lucy and her daughter were part of the revolt and Hamptons victorious campaign.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Lucy lived the entire Confederate sagathe joythe defeatthe terrible fearthe gaining of personal strength.  This is the story of what made the South
        the South as we know it today  the story of what became of that lovingly remembered and longed for  world, and a very beautiful woman who was a
        vital part of that world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;

        It can only be a Southern story.
