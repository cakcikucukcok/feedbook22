  <title>Retablos - Octavio Solis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Octavio: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Selling and Marketing Points&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessible writing that is a mix of memoir and flash fiction.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Stories quickly lead readers to dramatic, emotional moments, and each vignette builds upon the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the artistic trajectory of Sam Shepard, Octavio is well-known for his theater work and will now find a home in the literary world with this collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories describe life on the border, growing up between Texas (El Paso) and Mexico&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in from Julia Alvarez:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Reminiscent of THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET the way way the small vignettes build a narrative and lyrical arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octavio Solis does with words and imagery, lyricism and details, humor and heartbreak what the master craftsmen &amp;amp; women of the traditional r&lt;em&gt;etablos&lt;/em&gt; do with wood and paint, achieving the same results: these short luminous &lt;em&gt;retablos&lt;/em&gt; are magical and enticing. Unpretentiously and with an unerring accuracy of tone and rhythm, Solis slowly builds what amounts to a storybook cathedral. We inhabit a border world rich in characters, lush with details, playful and poignant, a border that refutes the stereotypes and divisions smaller minds create. Solis reminds us that sometimes the most profound truths are best told with crafted fictions&amp;mdash;and he is a master at it. His is a large, capacious, and inclusive imagination. Just as the traditional retablos are objects of beauty ultimately meant as devotional pieces, Solis&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Retablos&lt;/em&gt; will make devotees of his readers.&quot; --Julia Alvarez is the author of numerous works of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and children&amp;rsquo;s books, including &lt;em&gt;How the Garc&amp;iacute;a Girls Lost Their Accents&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;In the Time of the Butterflies&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The murky flow of the Rio Grande River, the border patrol we call &lt;em&gt;la migra, &lt;/em&gt;demons, a petty crime of stolen candy, street urchins, family squabbles, eccentric neighbors, and bike rides in which dust envelops a skinny kid named Octavio Solis. When he stops peddling years later, he&amp;rsquo;ll spank the dust from his clothes, but not all of it. Some of it clings to his very soul, and will cling to us, the reader, in this tender and perceptive memoir. This is American &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;Mexican literature a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw from the always hustling El Paso border.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Gary Soto, author of &lt;em&gt;The Elements of San Joaquin &lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Retablos - Octavio Solis</i></b> | As explained by Octavio Solis, a distinguished Latino author who has written over 20 plays, a retablo is a small votive painting commonly associated with Latin American cultures. It’s usually painted on cheap, reused metal, and it tells the story of a near-disaster that was survived only by the grace of God.<br /><b><i>Book Review - Retablos by Octavio Solis | BookPage</i></b> | "Playwright Octavio Solis lays out his memoir in retablos, folk paintings made on repurposed metal in gratitude for the divine resolution of life's crises. Each of the retablos present a vignette from his life growing up in the border town of El Paso, Texas, as an 'anchor baby' in the 60s and 70s.<br /><b><i>Retablos: Stories From a Life Lived Along the Border ...</i></b> | I discovered Octavio Solis when Retablos was staged by Word for Word at a LitQuake event at the Elbo Room. The stories immerse you with their engaging prose, the universality of their familial characters, and small glimpses into Mexicanidad on the border.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Retablos - Octavio Solis</a> </h3></p><hr/>
