  <title>The Old Way - Elizabeth Marshall Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One of our most influential anthropologists reevaluates her long and illustrious career by returning to her roots--and the roots of life as we know it&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Elizabeth Marshall Thomas first arrived in Africa to live among the Kalahari San, or bushmen, it was 1950, she was nineteen years old, and these last surviving hunter-gatherers were living as humans had lived for 15,000 centuries. Thomas wound up writing about their world in a seminal work, &lt;i&gt;The Harmless People &lt;/i&gt;(1959). It has never gone out of print.&lt;br&gt;Back then, this was uncharted territory and little was known about our human origins. Today, our beginnings are better understood. And after a lifetime of interest in the bushmen, Thomas has come to see that their lifestyle reveals great, hidden truths about human evolution.&lt;br&gt;As she displayed in her bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Hidden Life of Dogs&lt;/i&gt;, Thomas has a rare gift for giving voice to the voices we don&#39;t usually listen to, and helps us see the path that we have taken in our human journey. In &lt;i&gt;The Old Way&lt;/i&gt;, she shows how the skills and customs of the hunter-gatherer share much in common with the survival tactics of our animal predecessors. And since it is &quot;knowledge, not objects, that endure&quot; over time, Thomas vividly brings us to see how linked we are to our origins in the animal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Old Way &lt;/i&gt;is a rare and remarkable achievement, sure to stir up controversy, and worthy of celebration.&lt;/p&gt;" />
