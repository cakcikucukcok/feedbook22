  <title>Woody Allen - Robert E. Kapsis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This revised and updated edition gathers interviews and profiles covering the entire forty-five year span of Woody Allen&amp;#8217;s career as a filmmaker, including detailed discussions of his most popular as well as his most critically acclaimed works. The present collection is a complete update of the volume that first appeared in 2006. In the years since, Allen has continued making movies, including &lt;i&gt;Midnight in Paris&lt;/i&gt; and the Oscar-winning &lt;i&gt;Blue Jasmine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;While many interviews from the original edition have been retained in the present volume, nine new entries extend the coverage of Allen&amp;#8217;s directorial career through 2015. In addition, there is a new, in-depth interview from the period covered in the first edition. Most of the interviews included in the original volume first appeared in such widely known publications and venues as the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Playboy&lt;/i&gt;. A number of smaller and lesser-known venues are also represented, especially in the new volume. Several interviews from non-American sources add an international perspective on Allen&amp;#8217;s work.&lt;p&gt;Materials for the new volume include pieces focusing primarily on Allen&amp;#8217;s films as well as broader profiles and interviews that also concentrate on his literary talent. Perhaps Stephen Mamber best describes Allen&amp;#8217;s distinctiveness, especially early in his career: &amp;#8220;Woody Allen is not the best new American comedy director or the best comedy writer or the best comedy actor, he&amp;#8217;s simply the finest combination of all three.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;" />
