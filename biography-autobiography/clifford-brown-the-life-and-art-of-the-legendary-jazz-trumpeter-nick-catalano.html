  <title>Clifford Brown: The Life and Art of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter - Nick Catalano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although he died in a tragic car accident at twenty-five, Clifford Brown is widely considered one of the most important figures in the history of jazz--now, in this absorbing work, Nick Catalano gives us the first major biography of this musical giant.  Based on extensive interviews with Browns family, friends, and fellow jazz musicians, this is a fascinating portrait of a remarkable musician. Catalano colorfully depicts Browns life, showing how he developed a dazzling technique that few jazz players have equaled. We read of his meteoric rise in Philadelphia, his tour of Europe with Lionel Hampton, and his formation of the Brown-Roach Quintet with prominent drummer Max Roach. The book also features an informed analysis of Browns major recorded solos, highlighting his originality and revealing why he remains such a great influence today." />
