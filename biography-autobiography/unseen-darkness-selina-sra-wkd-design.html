  <title>Unseen Darkness - Selina Sra, Wkd Design</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A true story of a police woman whose colleagues allegedly ostracized her, complied a dossier of false or misleading allegations against her and delayed coming to her aid in potentially dangerous situations leaves her in tears.
Falling behind the race - Claire Dyer - The Guardian
Unseen Darkness - the incredible story of the most amazing inspirational beautiful female who against all odds, finds magic and treasures, and demonstrates the true meaning of a free spirit.
Asian Times
Unseen Darkness, we shared a bond that endured everything from childhood experiences to adult intimacies of pain and pleasure, shes a goddess, a woman of beauty, sexuality, a mirror of me, I saw a woman, and a lady thrive to be a free spirit, turn to an angel of inspired sexuality.
Madame - Monica Lang EXOTICA
Policewoman, dominatrix, mistress to a London gangster, Unseen Darkness is the inspirational, true-life story of a woman rejected by her family in childhood and forced to agree to an arranged marriage, who simply will not give up, whose instinct even in her darkest hour is to fight. The writing has an intensity and authenticity derived from direct experience that few other books of this kind possess. Candid, heartbreaking and at times shocking for all readers. This is a roller coaster ride that once on, you cannot get off.
