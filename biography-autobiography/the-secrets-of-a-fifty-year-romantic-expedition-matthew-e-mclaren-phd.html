  <title>The Secrets of a Fifty-Year Romantic Expedition - Matthew E. McLaren PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you remember the first day I saw you? The first date we had? The first time I took you into my arms? The vow we made? Do you realize it is fifty years since we said I do? I love you my first lady, my queen. With Jesus as our guiding light we will continue to walk together until death. By the power of prayer I have found you. You are my special treasure. You are a life partner with so much strength and compassion, a partner with such integrity and goodness in your heart; you have guarded the inner circle of our relationship and made it the sacred centre of our life, just for Jesus, you and me. God used a picture in Ezekiel 16 to describe His people and I would like to paraphrase it by saying. When I pass by you again and look upon you, indeed your heart was the heart of love; so I spread my arms and covered you, I went into a covenant with you; a covenant that cannot be broken. The more I know you, the deeper I appreciate and love you. Its like how Id cherish and treasure a rare and priceless work of art." />
