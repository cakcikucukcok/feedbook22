&lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terry Dobson releases second book, &#39;Abri&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WAKEFIELD, England - Recounting the story of working to save his family&#39;s home, author Terry Dobson releases his new book, &quot;Abri: My Oasis&quot; (published by AuthorHouse UK). The book is a series of stories bringing together the ups and downs and day-to-day family life as Dobson attempts to save their Abri, or shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home was a love-at-first-sight love affair between the author and the bricks and mortar, as the property was in a terrible state, boarded up and desolate, with the owners unaware of its dilapidated and deteriorating condition. The author began to tirelessly and passionately restore the property so it could once again become a treasured family home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Dobson found he would also have to fight for the home when developers launched an initiative to construct as many as 80 homes on the same land. The green-belt-land designation was removed, making the land subject to development. Dobson says this is happening because the current United Kingdom political agenda is to build more affordable homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This action is removing surrounding countryside by the acre,&quot; he says, &quot;however, my story is unique in the fact that it is my life, my family with all its limitations is attempting to fight the cause.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
