  <title>Split Season: 1981 - Jeff Katz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The never-before-told story of the momentous season torn in half by the bitter players strike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;1981 was a watershed moment in American sports, when players turned an oligarchy of owners into a game where they had a real voice. Midway through the season, a game-changing strike ripped baseball apart, the first time a season had ever been stopped in the middle because of a strike. Marvin Miller and the MLB Players Association squared off against Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and the owners in a fight to protect players rights to free agency and defend America&#39;s pastime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a time bomb was ticking as the 1981 season began, the game rose to impressive---and now legendary---heights. Pete Rose chased Stan Musial&#39;s National League hit record and rookie Fernando Valenzuela was creating a sensation as the best pitcher in the majors when the stadiums went dark and the players went on strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in modern history, there were first- and second-half champions; the two teams with the overall best records in the National League were not awarded play-off berths. When the season resumed after an absence of 712 games, Rose&#39;s resumption of his pursuit, the resurgence of Reggie Jackson, the rise of the Montreal Expos, and a Nolan Ryan no-hitter became notable events. The Dodgers bested their longtime rivals in a Yankees-Dodgers World Series, the last classic matchup of those storied opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sourcing incredible and extensive interviews with almost all of the major participants in the strike, &lt;i&gt;Split Season: 1981&lt;/i&gt; returns us to the on- and off-field drama of an unforgettable baseball year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
