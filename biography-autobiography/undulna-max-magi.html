  <title>UNDULNA - Max Magi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first of many journeys around the world opens up a whole new horizon for young medical student Max Magi. His travels will take him to the far corners of the world, destroying his certainties, yet bringing new strength to his deeply rooted values.&lt;br /&gt;
The very first voyage, to far away Madagascar, sets the foundation for the man that he will become thanks to his close contact with the first inspirational mentors on the medical staff in Antananarivo and the suffering of the patients. Indeed, it his here that his intellectual honesty and the courage to face any challenge are cemented in him.&lt;br /&gt;
We follow Magi in his polished, incisive narration as he gains understanding of the characters and cultures in four continents and learns how to apply the fundamental care and medical skills needed in so many different walks of life.&lt;br /&gt;
We finally arrive at our journey&amp;rsquo;s end to find a man that has become an internationally renowned name in orthopedic knee surgery and a pioneer in arthroscopy.&lt;br /&gt;
His autobiography, however, goes far beyond the reaches of the most advanced medical centers from Europe to the United States and turns into a story of adventure and danger, from street fights to near brushes with death in the midst of political turmoil in North Africa to the hidden dangers of the topical seas. As we follow him, we come to know a man and professional of great moral value who does not hesitate to go against established rules and customs to broaden the range of his field and his knowledge and to quench an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a burning curiosity." />
