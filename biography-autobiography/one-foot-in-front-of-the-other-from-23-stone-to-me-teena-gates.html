  <title>One Foot in Front of The Other: From 23 Stone to Me - Teena Gates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How one woman got her life back - one step at a time  Checking in at a tiny 5 foot 2 inches and a massive 23 stone in weight, Irish broadcast journalist Teena Gates was staring death in the face, when a doctor&#39;s grim diagnosis shocked her into a decision that would change her life. If she continued to take the path she was on, she would die.  Just over one year later Teena had lost an amazing 12 stone - more than half her body weight. She had climbed to Everest Base Camp and reached the icy summit of Island Peak in the Himalayas. She had gone from finding it difficult to walk to the shops - to being on top of the world.  One Foot in Front of the Other is the story of realising that you can change your life against all odds. It&#39;s the inspirational journey of a woman who was resigned to living life imprisoned in her own body, until a spark lit up a desire to break free. It&#39;s a story of pain, of hope, of friendship, and of how far you can really go - by putting one foot in front of the other." />
