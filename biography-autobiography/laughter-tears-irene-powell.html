  <title>Laughter &amp; Tears - Irene Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Irene Powell&#39;s new book &quot;Laughter and Tears&quot; will inspire readers.
New biography of the life of a wartime civilian hero and lifetime friend is certain to affect readers. 
LIVERPOOL, England -- Despite the seeming best efforts of generations, poverty, famine and war persist in the world. One has only to turn on the nightly news or read the headlines to know this is true. In her new book, &quot;Laughter and Tears: Johanna&#39;s Story&quot;, debut author Irene Powell presents the inspiring story of her friend, Johanna, who survived the German occupation of Holland during World War II, then worked in German refugee camps before settling in England and training as a nurse and midwife. 
&quot;Johanna was a really down-to-earth person, &quot; Irene writes, &quot;with no special attributes other than a strong determination to live life to the fullest, no matter what life dealt to her and to help and care for others.&quot; The narrative reveals a woman who did just those things, helping others and making herself and example for anyone who wishes to live a life of value. 
An excerpt from &quot;Laughter and Tears&quot;:
	&quot;We were all starving. People were dying from hunger. My sister and I left home in search for food. We had no money or valuables with which to barter so took some of dad&#39;s shaving soap hoping someone would exchange it for a little food. We had been walking for thirteen hours. Our feet were blistered, we were cold, tired and hungry. We planned to knock on one more door. If that failed we would have to find shelter under a tree for the night and try again tomorrow.&quot;
Though Johanna died in 2011, just before her 85th birthday, her legacy and her memory live on in the people she helped, friends she made and lives she changed." />
