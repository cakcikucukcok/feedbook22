  <title>Apologies to My Censor - Mitch Moxley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspired by his article &amp;#8220;Rent a White Guy,&amp;#8221; published in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, comes a chronicle of Moxley&amp;#8217;s outrageous adventures in Beijing--from fake businessman to Chinese propagandist to low-budget music video star--as well as a young man&amp;#8217;s search for identity in the most unexpected of places.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mitch Moxley came to Beijing in the spring of 2007 to take a job as a writer and editor for &lt;em&gt;China Daily&lt;/em&gt;, the country&amp;#8217;s only English-language national newspaper. The Chinese economy was booming, the Olympics were on the horizon, and Beijing was being transformed into a world-class city overnight. Moxley planned to stay through the Olympics and then head back to Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was five years ago. In that time Moxley has fed a goat to a tiger, watched a bear ride a bicycle while wearing lingerie (he has witnesses), and has eaten scorpions and silkworms. He also appeared as one of Cosmopolitan&amp;#8217;s 100 most eligible bachelors in China, acted in a state-funded Chinese movie, and was paid to pose as a fake businessman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiences, and many more, are chronicled in Tall Rice, the comic adventures and misadventures of Moxley&amp;#8217;s time in China and his transformation into his alter ego&amp;#8212;Mi Gao, or Tall Rice. The books spans the five years that Moxley has lived in China; five years that coincide with China&amp;#8217;s arrival on the world stage and its emergence as a global superpower. A funny and honest look at expat life, and the ways in which a country can touch and transform you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
