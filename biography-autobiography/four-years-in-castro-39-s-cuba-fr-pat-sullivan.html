  <title>Four Years in Castro&#39;s Cuba - Fr. Pat Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Although I served as a Catholic pastor in Cuba from 1994 until 1998, it
wasnt until around 2003 that I started writing down some of my experiences
and thoughts, which came to form this little book. I approached a couple
of publishers with it, but found no interest. So I made it available over the
internet to anyone who might be interested in Cuba. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As now in 2012 my family has kindly offered to see about printing up
a small number of copies, I wondered if some up-dating of the material
should be done. After all, a number of years have passed. But while I have
been interested in following the news about what has since happened in
Cuba I am by no means an expert on more recent events. And as I have
been serving the small Spanish-speaking community in Okinawa, Japan
for the past seven years my access to Cuban news is limited. So, I just
present here the text as it is: my view of the Cuban situation during the
years I actually lived there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having moved from English to Spanish, then to Miskito in Nicaragua,
then to Japanese, my grammar, spelling and capitalization practices have
become a bit confused. I am grateful for the editing and correction help of
my brother and of Prof. Anthony Jenkins of the Ryukyu University here in
Okinawa, but Ill have to take responsibility for errors and inconsistencies
that remain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May God grant that these pages be of some use in promoting better
understanding and peace among nations. &lt;/p&gt;
