  <title>Bonsheá - Coral Anika Theill, Judy Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just when you thought you knew what was going on in your community, here comes a story that just may shatter the security of your American Dream&lt;/i&gt;. This is a story about abuse, survival, false religion and dubious court systems in a state that may be advanced on some levels, but sometimes proves to be a miserable failure in terms of equity and fairness and conventional thinking.  &lt;i&gt;Tim King&lt;/i&gt;, Editor/Salem-News.com, War Correspondent, Author, &lt;i&gt;BETRAYAL: Toxic Exposure of U.S. Marines, Murder and Cover-Up&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;BONSHE&lt;/b&gt; pierces through the darkness that hides the legal systems routine abuse of mothers and children&lt;/i&gt;. It is a work of immense courage, a true tale of heartbreak and salvation. Not a single particle of the wisdom Coral shares misses the mark. - &lt;i&gt;Maureen T. Hannah&lt;/i&gt;, Ph.D., Chair, Battered Mothers Custody Conference, Albany, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;BONSHE&lt;/b&gt; illustrates the degree to which the legal system can also be used as a vehicle to further perpetuate abuse even after the victim has chosen to take a stand against the abuse.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt;John Haroldson&lt;/i&gt;, District Attorney, Benton County District Attorneys Office, Corvallis, Oregon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coral Theills &lt;b&gt;BONSHE&lt;/b&gt; is intense in its effort to open the doors behind which many domestic violence perpetrators have stood for so long in the name of privacy.&lt;/i&gt; At every level, family and friends, key people in her community, the health care system, the legal and judicial system, and the culture which socializes us all, she met with adversity and re-victimization. In the telling of her recovery, which is truly remarkable given her circumstances, the reader gets a vivid sense of the indominability of her spirit and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend this book for health care providers, those in the criminal justice system, and volunteers or helpers of any kind to get insights and clarity about the complex dynamics of domestic violence and its toxic effects to individuals and society---and what needs to be done to eradicate this pandemic problem.  &lt;i&gt;Barbara A. May, PhD, RN&lt;/i&gt;, Professor Emerita of Nursing, Linfield College, Portland, Oregon&lt;/p&gt;" />
