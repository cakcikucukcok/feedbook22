  <title>Harry Kane - England&#39;s Hero - Frank Worral</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;England manager Gareth Southgate&#39;s decision to appoint Kane, still just twenty-three years old, as the team captain in 2017 could have been seen as premature, bringing with it pressure that could damage a young player&#39;s career. However, he knew that Kane, a modest, humble and inspiring figure was up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having lost faith in the national team, English fans weren&#39;t sure the players would even make it out of their group. No one could have predicted that this young and relatively inexperienced side would achieve their best result since 1990, or that their captain would win the tournament&#39;s Golden Boot with six goals. Perhaps most importantly for the team and their manager, they brought the country together to make for an unforgettable summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While their eventual semi-final loss to Croatia came as a stinging disappointment, this is just the start for the team and their skipper, one of our most exciting players for a generation and a truly world-class English star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this in-depth biography, bestselling sports writer Frank Worrall traces Kane&#39;s journey from an ordinary childhood in north London, growing up just a few miles from White Hart Lane, to the most remarkable tournament of his career.&lt;/p&gt;" />
