  <title>It Is a Fault and Not a Guilt - Abdullah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I wrote about my relationship with the half-Indian Saudi girl who used to work in our house, and after I have the desire to marry her, my family stood against me, and my mother got divorced because of me. Therefore, I had to give up on that girl. Unfortunately, I gave up on her, and after that, I got into a car accident, which caused to me lose 50 percent of my neck movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did made my reputation bad between my family and me. I may need to do another surgery according to the diagnosis of the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have come to a point where I can no longer stand or tolerate things. Many things are bothering me, like my health condition, my family members who look at me with contempt, the girl I wronged and now I feel remorse and wish I could help her and her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Indian maids daughter need from the embassy of India to help her and protect her from her father family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why because her father family had influence over others and the only way to support her by talk about her story so that the embassy of India can stand by and protect her in the face of her fathers family and establish her ancestry because her father is Saudi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope, by publishing my story, to find whoever can offer me help and support.&lt;/p&gt;" />
