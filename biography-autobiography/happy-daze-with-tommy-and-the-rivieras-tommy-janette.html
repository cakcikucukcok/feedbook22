  <title>Happy Daze with Tommy and the Rivieras - Tommy Janette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1963, author Tommy Janette and his neighborhood buddies in West Haven, Connecticut, were looking for something to do. And that something was starting a band and playing music. He had no idea what the future would hold for this group that originally was formed to impress the girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Happy Daze with Tommy and the Rivieras&lt;/b&gt;, Janette narrates the bands more-than-twenty-year history. It follows Tommy and the Rivieras through the years they opened for and worked with the Coasters, the Temptations, the Beach Boys, and many others. This memoir tells the true story about Jim Morrisons arrest, as Janette was the complainant in 1967 when the group opened for the Doors at the New Haven Arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing an eventful journey, with plenty of quirky moments, &lt;b&gt;Happy Daze with Tommy and the Rivieras&lt;/b&gt; goes backstage and offers insights and stories about the venues they played, the records they recorded, and some of the stars Tommy and the Rivieras worked with and the stories about them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
