  <title>Superficial - Andy Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The star-studded and sidesplitting follow up to &lt;i&gt;The Andy Cohen Diaries&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The megapopular host of &lt;i&gt;Watch What Happens: Live &lt;/i&gt;and executive producer of &lt;i&gt;The Real Housewives &lt;/i&gt;franchise is back, better than ever, and telling stories that will keep his publicist up at night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Since the publication of his last book, Andy has toured the country with his sidekick Anderson Cooper, hit the radio waves with his own Sirius station, &lt;i&gt;Radio Andy&lt;/i&gt;, appeared on &lt;i&gt;Real Time with Bill Maher&lt;/i&gt; despite his mother&#39;s conviction he was not intellectually prepared, hosted NBC&#39;s Primetime New Year&#39;s Eve special, guest edited &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, starred in Bravo&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Then &amp; Now with Andy Cohen, &lt;/i&gt;offended celebrities with his ongoing case of foot-in-mouth disease, and welcomed home Teresa &quot;Namaste&quot; Giudice, from a &lt;i&gt;brief&lt;/i&gt; stint in jail. Hopping from the Hamptons to the Manhattan dating world, the dog park to the red carpet, Cardinals superfan and mama&#39;s boy Andy Cohen, with Wacha in tow, is the kind of star that fans are dying to be friends with. This book gives them that chance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If &lt;i&gt;The Andy Cohen Diaries&lt;/i&gt; was deemed &quot;the literary equivalent of a Fresca and tequila&quot; by Jimmy Fallon, &lt;i&gt;Superficial &lt;/i&gt;is a double: dishier, juicier, and friskier. In this account of his escapades--personal, professional, and behind-the-scenes--Andy tells us not only what goes down, but exactly what he thinks of it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
