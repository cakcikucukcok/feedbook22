      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you know how to avoid spankings? Did you realize that telling lies can get you out of trouble? Do you know why its not a good idea to suggest to a teenage girls parents that she might win a beauty contest at the Hogzilla Festival? The answer to these and other vital questions are found in this book, a collection of stories the author first posted on Facebook.
Jimmy Allen grew up in a small town in Georgia, during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, in a family of big talkers, including four uncles who were great storytellers. He continues that tradition in Keep on Pedaling, sharing homespun stories of hard work and easy play, little victories and big defeats, the good and bad, happy and sad times of growing up. But Jimmys stories are not bound by time and place. Human nature is at the heart of each story, where youll meet familiar people in situations that mirror your own. The kid who hides a firecracker in his mamas sugar bowl, the boy whos fleeced out of his spending money at the fair, the war veteran who cant seem to reclaim his old life, the football coach who learns how to overcome adversitythese people have a lot to teach you about how to keep on pedaling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
