  <title>When Self Fails You, God Will Sustain You - Winston A. Keene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are not happy with the way your life is heading, you need to reroute its direction; to overcome your failure, you need to review your direction for being an overcomerto revalidate your desire for living, and not relive your failure, both inside and outside.
I cannot give you your goal, but I can give you the requirements to reach that goal. That is resonating inside of you. The requirements are to believe in yourself, trust in God, for he will sustain you. I have seen what successful people do, over and over again, after overcoming failure. They forget how they got over. We need to give glory to the one that glorifies.
This book can help you to relive and take charge of your new life. Not only will it display failures of the past, where it is willful, or even the negative approach you may have taken, which may drown the readers ability or their thoughts to survive. It will also direct us to the know-hows to maneuver changes and maximize life now &quot;When Self Fails You, God will sustain You.&quot; This book will offer you a reality-based avenue to those seeking to be sustained by God. The author believes that there is nothing more important than your genuine decision for overcoming failures. Life is a series of decisions you make; you make them, and unless you accept the responsibility for where you are right now, you will never overcome failures of the past.
For the years that lie ahead, mixing both sacred and secular insights has a unique blend of practical and pragmatic leads, coupled with good taste of wisdom that scripture has given.
For my readers, this new book is, without question, a transformation for the soul; it gives permission to relive and the know-hows to achieve the greater aspects of living that God grants us.
The author believes that there is nothing more important than your genuine decision. I suggest that the reader (before you make your choice to overcome failure) please, read, and digest the contents of this book. 
To God be the glory, for the great things he hath done to this writer." />
