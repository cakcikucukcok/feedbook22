&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;SEEN IN THE BLOOD is the story of
an ordinary woman who serves an extraordinary God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;You will laugh, cry and identify with
the author&#39;s life.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;From the time of being
abandoned at birth, you will walk through her times of happiness, sadness, aloneness
and feelings of total helplessness.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;You will
see the mercy, faithfulness and love of God as He continually watches over her throughout
every circumstance of life.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He looked down
and saw her covered in her own blood, alone in a basket and commanded her to &quot;Live!&quot;&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;His faithful watch-care guided and protected her
before she knew Him as her Savior and Lord. He has continued that watch-care since
1953 when she met Him as her own personal Savior and Lord.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;She is being trained and guided by the Holy Spirit
to fulfill her destiny in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Her Scripture for life is Proverbs
3:5-6.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The author readily admits she is daily
learning to live this scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&quot;Trust in the Lord with all &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;thine&lt;/span&gt; heart; and lean not unto &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;thine&lt;/span&gt;
own understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;In all thy ways acknowledge him, and
he shall direct thy paths.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;This book will challenge you as well
as draw you to know this magnificent God!&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;The Creator of the universe who is so personal He knows every hair upon the
head of every human being upon the earth.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Matthew &lt;st1:time Hour=&quot;10&quot; Minute=&quot;30&quot;&gt;10:30&lt;/st1:time&gt; tells us Jesus said,
&quot;But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.&quot;&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;As a loving father He patiently waits for mankind
to call out to Him, Father, Father!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;SEEN IN THE BLOOD will cause you to
understand the unconditional love and mercy of God in a new and exciting way!&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The authors desire is for her life to leave a
distinctive trail that will cause others to seek and follow her Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
