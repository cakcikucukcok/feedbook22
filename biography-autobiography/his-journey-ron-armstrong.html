  <title>His Journey - Ron Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is an autobiography written in the third person. The author felt it would be easier to speak in the third person, not only of his failures but also of his successes. The story takes place on the sea, and the reader will easily see the symbolism of the journey of the old saint. He will see the responses of the old man to his circumstances; he will also get an inside look at the thoughts and feelings of a man of God. Most of all, the reader will see the great redemption, the overwhelming love, and the undeniable restoration of those whom Christ has chosen to call &quot;friends.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
