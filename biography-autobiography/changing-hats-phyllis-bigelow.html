  <title>Changing Hats - Phyllis Bigelow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is based on true life experiences of, primarily, two people; a mother and son. Both of them contribute to the story as told to the author, primarily by the son. Most people have never had to deal with the dilemma the son did, and it would certainly never be their desire.
 It is an eye-opener, and begs to be read by all upper-aged teenagers on up as it offers the opportunity to learn the truth of the secret pain of the son who experienced what is being revealed, and has the proof to substantiate what shocking truth he reveals to his own mother for the first time, as well as to the author. 
The individual is now ready to have the people know the truth of living with this condition. It has become evident to him that hiding holds one in bondage, but the truth sets one free.
The book exposes how society puts great pressure on individuals, despite some possible advantages. People dont even choose to be part of some societies.  They are, however, always even born into at least one that is immediately a part of their existence.  
The animal kingdom even governs itself better than humans do. A good example is two male animals of the same kind using their might in deciding who gets the female. The rules are cut and dry. No autocrat or any other ruler is ever needed over them in their naturally lived lives.  All members accept the rules because they are innate.
Humans can decide to become members of any number of many societies in their lifetimes. They may not even give  any thought to some they actually are part of  relative to  professions, where they reside, such as on the farm or in a  large city, religions ,education, and a zillion more.   Never-the-less humans are part of societies. It is comparable to wearing a dog tag (ID) while in the military. Society in America sort of creates its own caste system, if one will honestly give that due consideration.
In the animal kingdom there is no such thing as politics or any outside rule. There may be some tussles at times like at breeding season, but not an on-going war that involves great numbers taking sides. Instead, the problem is solved between only two animals. The loser may not be happy, but there is absolute resolve. Maybe the next time the loser becomes the winner, as procreation continues, and so do their unchanged rules. It is simple.
Unlike a puppet, man has a conscience, but has free will in the making of choices. The choices of far too many people are shameful when pitted against animal behavior. They sometimes bring war and many other negatives in human life. This book will reveal that societies of humans can be detrimental, or helpful, though not at all the express purpose of writing of it. 
The basic information in the beginning of the book reveals true tales as told to the author by the mother. It covers information from her sons grandparents on down for understanding of who the family was, over-all. It is important for the reader to know this. It includes many hilarious events, and depicts a bright, interesting family with a great sense of humor, yet, very responsible people of stability. It shows the heritage of the mother and son was not the cause of the rare malady the son endured for nearly half a century.
 Benet, a very bright boy, had a great advantage in being born in such a family, but a great personal disadvantage that none of the family had ever seen. It causes one to wonder if it could have made a difference, but the resulting conclusion from family after only recently learning the truth, is because of the time in which the child was born, probably nothing would or, maybe, could even have been done to solve the problem.
As the book develops, it exposes the decades of deep anguish the son privately endured.  Since a very young boy, likely about the age of three, he was aware his gender was not serving him well. Though he didnt really understand it, he knew he was different. He was trapped in it for decades. Society does breed stigma, d" />
