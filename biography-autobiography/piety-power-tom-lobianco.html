  <title>Piety &amp; Power - Tom LoBianco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIKE PENCE: THE ULTIMATE POLITICAL SHAPE-SHIFTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican . . . in that order.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;Mike Pence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the impeachment of President Donald Trump remains a constant topic of discussion in political circles, the questions around our current vice president also continue to swirl, and in some ways, the puzzlement over his true nature has never truly been clear. Tom LoBianco, a longtime Pence reporter, cuts to the core of the nation&amp;#8217;s most enigmatic politician in this intimate yet expansive account of the vice president&amp;#8217;s journey to the White House. In &lt;em&gt;Piety &amp;#38; Power, &lt;/em&gt;LoBianco follows Pence from his evangelical conversion in college to his failed career as a young lawyer, to his thwarted attempts at politics until he hitched his wagon to far-right extremism, becoming the Congressional poster boy for faith-based policy and Tea Party rhetoric. Giving readers a minute-by-minute account of the selection process that made him Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s unlikely running mate in 2016, &lt;em&gt;Piety &amp;#38; Power &lt;/em&gt;traces Pence&amp;#8217;s personal and political life, painting a picture of a man driven by faith and conviction, yes, but also a hunger for power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LoBianco crafts a revealing portrait of the real Mike Pence&amp;#8212;a politician whose understated style masks a drive for power, but also a surprising political acumen&amp;#8212;by drawing on years of research, over one hundred exclusive interviews with those closest to the vice president, and deep ties both within the Beltway and Indiana state politics. Highlighting Pence&amp;#8217;s strained, at times obsequious, relationship with Trump; his marriage to Karen; his deeply repressed personality; his presidential aspirations and plans for America&amp;#8217;s future; and his deep-rooted faith in his country, in God, and ultimately himself; &lt;em&gt;Piety &amp;#38; Power &lt;/em&gt;provides insights and answers as it sheds light on this ambitious Midwestern politician, his past, and his possible future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
