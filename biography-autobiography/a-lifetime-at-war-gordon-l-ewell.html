  <title>A Lifetime At War - Gordon  L. Ewell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Master Sergeant Gordon L. Ewell is a combat engineer and expert in the tactics and techniques the enemy used in Iraq to assemble, disguise, and detonate deadly improvised explosive devices (IEDs). He became part of the first special two-solider team whose mission was to find and render safe the IEDs, before they could unleash their deadly force upon other soldiers, convoys, civilians, and local civilian commuters during the War in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He performed fifty-nine dangerous missions, coauthored a first-of-its-kind manual used for the training of special teams that would have the mission of finding IEDs, was blown-up six different times, and saved countless lives. He received the Bronze Star Medal for demonstrating personal courage and conviction on multiple occasions by continually performing his duties while under enemy attack, and the Purple Heart Medal for wounds received while engaged in combat during the war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though permanently disabled, he continues to fight. A Lifetime at War is more than just an incredible and inspiring personal account of his road to recovery. Once again Ewell is using his expertise and experiencethis time to help wounded warriors navigate the hell of recovery. He helps us all to understand that while the War in Iraq may have ended on December 15, 2011, for the thousands of soldiers severely wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, their war will never end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
