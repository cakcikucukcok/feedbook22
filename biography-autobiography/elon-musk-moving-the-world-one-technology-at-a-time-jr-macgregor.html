  <title>Elon Musk: Moving the World One Technology at a Time - Jr MacGregor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Put aside what you read on the web about Elon Musk. There is a significant amount more to him than just his genius and his accomplishments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book lays out the life that he had before arriving in the United States and looks at the boy inside who set a path for himself, and literally went through the fires of hell before getting the opportunities that he wished for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He did not fall into wealth and he did not work his way up the corporate ladder, Elon made every bit of his life that you see today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the stories that you find in this book will shock and awe you and change the way you look at your own challenges. From arriving in a new country with just a few bucks and not knowing anyone, to working in farms and cleaning up after barn animals, to working in the fires of a toxic furnace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Read about the man that is about to make this planet a safer place to live.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elon Musk is an inspiration for a generation because he represents many of the values that define today&amp;#39;s Millennials and Generation X. From PayPal to Tesla, the driving force that built these icons of the imagination was the desire to make the world a better place for everyone &amp;ndash; it was never about the money.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book gives you a deeper look and analysis of a man that defies the traditional mold of industrialist, entrepreneur, and achiever.&lt;br /&gt;
