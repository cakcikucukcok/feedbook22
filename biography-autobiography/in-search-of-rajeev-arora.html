  <title>In Search Of… - Rajeev Arora</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are several experiences that gradually start looking like pearls, held together by a string that is practically... the untouchable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several developments, which can be classed as successes. On the other hand, there are failures, despite all the good will and effort. In the mix of things, it becomes imperative to make peace with... the untouchable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our nature, nurture, and circumstances... we gradually figure out our formula to keep afloat... the Mantra!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years I have been having a glass of warm water with honey and lemon in the morning, as suggested by many for good health. Generally I am more comfortable in outdoors than indoors. Going for a walk stimulates me at many levels. For me its all part of... the Mantra!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few days back, I was grating radish. The grater was not the best. It occurred to me that a slightly different design would do better. On a casual visit to the shops that afternoon, I happened to come across a grater, just of the right design! Several events of such precision, often point me to... the cosmic dance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our world is held together by friction. Every part of our journey from womb to tomb, every step we take, every garment we put on, every note we write... rely on friction! This necessary evil called friction that also gives plenty of headache and heartache, is an integral part of... the cosmic dance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an effort to touch... the untouchable, decipher... the Mantra to help us all participate in the... the cosmic dance!&lt;/p&gt;" />
