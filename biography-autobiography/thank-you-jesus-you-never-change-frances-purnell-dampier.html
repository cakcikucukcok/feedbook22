  <title>Thank You Jesus! You Never Change - Frances Purnell-Dampier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You have cancer! These are chilling words to hear, which no human soul should ever have to hear, but that was the case for this author, like so many unsuspecting souls. This bold, serious, jaw-dropping, inspirational journal explores the stark, undeniable facts about the disease and the psychological and physical toll it takes on the mind and body. It permeates the mind of the authors as she investigates ways to combat the disease. She becomes a fierce warrior against the disease. Because of the deep faith in God possessed by the author, the journal becomes instrumental in helping not only her but uses the journal as a means of helping others who maybe questioning Why me? and going through the same insurmountable journey. 
The spiritually filled journal provides many valuable tips on how to remain serene, healthy, and positive as she maneuvers through chemotherapy and radiation. It gives clues to avoid falling into dangerous routines and false information. The author enjoys soulful southern cooking, which became a lifeline for her very survival. She uses this somber time to write, reflect, and experiment with delicious recipes, which accounted for her positive outcomes and the most satisfying, mouthwatering recipes one would ever hope to devour.
 Although struck with a horrifying disease, this author took the high road and determined that with God, all things are possible and that nothing could interfere with the life and goals she still needed to conquer. Cancer was only a tool to a much greater means. Her mission was to reach as many people as possible to let them know that God would provide them with life abundantly." />
