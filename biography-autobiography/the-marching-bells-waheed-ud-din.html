  <title>The Marching Bells - Waheed Ud Din</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am pleased to share the story of my life with you and hope to take you along with me when I retrace my steps and read my story along the way. I hope and trust that you will find it interesting, informative and educational. In the process I intend to give a brief picture of the social and political climate which surrounded my life and had played an important role in my thinking and eventually molding my course of action. I faced many occasions in my life where my decisions drastically changed the course of history for me. I am fortunate that my spirit of adventurism and self confidence has, by and large, been a source of satisfaction for me in my actions. I have been a fairly quick decision maker all my life and do not go into deep and lengthy sessions of contemplation and brooding. I give a very serious thought and due deliberations to the situation at hand but will not delay making a decision if that is what is required on the occasion. During the course of my journey of life I have endeavored to chart out and set the goals for myself but did not hesitate to change course to accommodate and answer to the call of the time and compromise with the inevitable human weaknesses and the forces of nature and destiny. I also intend to touch on some incidents of personal nature which I always avoided to talk about with my dear ones including my parents and siblings. These incidents, undoubtedly, influenced my thinking and had a profound effect on my perception of things which came my way during my journey of life." />
