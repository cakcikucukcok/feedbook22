  <title>Stalking Salmon and Wrestling Drunks - Peter L. Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Each fisherman steps onto the docks, sees Peter Gordon&#39;s boat the MV &lt;I&gt;Kalua&lt;/I&gt;, glances at the other members of the charter and feels a rush of anticipation. The challenge is on to see who will catch the biggest fish.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Told with a skipper&#39;s authority, &lt;I&gt;Stalking Salmon and Wrestling Drunks&lt;/I&gt; recounts the highs and lows of fishing with tourists, including dealing with rowdy guests, bad weather, near death experiences, lost fish, tangled lines, and sometimes even tragedy. Gordon&#39;s humour and tenacity shines through each tale to create an energetic memoir that will appeal to fishing enthusiasts, observers of human behaviour, travellers and anyone interested in recreational fishing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Stalking Salmon and Wrestling Drunks&lt;/I&gt; exemplifies the quintessential BC West Coast experience; however, the stories are much more than great fishing trips. As the skipper, each charter brought Gordon the challenge of &amp;#147;bringing together the most unlikely people, people who would never choose to spend four or five hours together.&amp;#8221; It might be as simple as children or jobs, but Gordon thrived on deeper, more powerful connections like re-introducing two men who had been in the same concentration camp together during World War II and hadn&#39;t seen each other since.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For Gordon, each charter was not only about a skipper and his crew, but was an opportunity to encourage each person to have an exceptional experience. &lt;I&gt;Stalking Salmon and Wrestling Drunks&lt;/I&gt; tells each story with precision, an eye for detail and the good-natured humour that carried the author through each day on the rough seas. This collection is a delightful balance between the adventure of open-water fishing, helping people cross the last item off their bucket list and making life-long friends in the process.&lt;/div&gt;" />
