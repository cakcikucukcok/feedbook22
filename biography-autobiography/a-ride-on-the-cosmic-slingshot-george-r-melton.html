  <title>A Ride on the Cosmic Slingshot - George R. Melton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1985, it seemed that George Melton and Wil Garcia were destined to become just two more unfortunate casualties of the AIDS epidemic. But after a profound spiritual awakening shifted their focus away from allopathic medicine to an internal process of self-discovery, they replaced lifetimes of guilt, anger, and fear with trust, self-esteem, and love. Within a year, their diseases were in remission and they were both symptom-free. But that is hardly the end of their story.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After a chance visit to a potluck evening of metaphysics and channeling forms an unlikely relationship with the spirit of Benjamin Franklin, George and Wil soon trade their comfortable New York home for a twenty-seven-foot Winnebago. As they set off on an eighteen-month, forty-thousand-mile sojourn to share their message of hope, the men are unwittingly catapulted into unlikely roles as poster boys for the nascent, self-healing movement. But when Wil unexpectedly dies, George begins questioning everything.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A Ride on the Cosmic Slingshot takes a poignant, inspiring journey through an unconditional love that proves stronger than death, as Wil reaches beyond the grave to offer George a final, life-altering gift.&lt;/p&gt;" />
