  <title>The Gloved Hand - M.C. ?Mike? Wikman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a compilation of my 55 years in the railroad industry. From my beginning to the year 2008, a lot has happened since 2008 until now. My dear wife of 56 years passed away on March 2, 2011 and I&#39;m now going it alone. I still work as a railroad consultant at a mine in New Mexico and the Border Pacific Railroad on the Mexican border here in Texas, at 77 years old but not steady. Life has been good to me as I still do a lot of photography in this area, hot San Antonio.
Next on my agenda to write a railroad novel as a child I used to read all the novels about railroading in man&#39;s imagination which I could not get enough of. So I&#39;m going to try to see what I can do as my mind seems to be working pretty well at this time.
I spend at a maximum of four hours a day on the computer Internet writing friends all over the country, some of the people I communicate with, I used to work for them when I started my career in the railroad industry. E-mailing friends is one of the greatest things that I do.
Learning never ends I try to learn the locomotive inside and out as I can&#39;t get enough of that either.
Living here in San Antonio isn&#39;t what it was 23 years ago; today it&#39;s crowded with people coming from all over every day to live here. I would like to move back east where I came from in Eastern Pennsylvania as I love the mountains and fewer people." />
