  <title>A Divine Invitation to  Create  a  New  World - Reynaldo Pareja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Television, radio, newspapers or the internet show a daily dismal world scenario. Every week, every month there is a major civil conflict or a terrorist attack somewhere. All over the world innocent are imprisoned, women are victims of domestic violence, are forced into underpaid labor or sex work. Children are still dying by the millions before they are five years old due to unsanitary conditions, lack of safe drinking water or malnourishment. Malaria and HIV-AIDS kill millions yearly and thousands of adolescents are kidnapped to become rebel soldiers. Autocratic governments deny democratic participation to the majority and suppress ferociously any popular peaceful manifestation. 
The worlds climate is now threatened due to man-made disequilibrium inflicted on the atmosphere by uncontrolled fumes and gas emissions of all types. Water sources are being poisoned by unscrupulous corporations dumping huge amounts of deadly chemicals into waterways. The inequality between rich and poor nations is so vast that 7 - 10% of the worlds population controls the natural and financial resources of the world at the expense of the rest who have no access to a minimum for survival. 
The reasons for this hellish situation are multiple and varied. They encompass deeply ingrained religious beliefs, unacceptable economic, military and power disparities, and uncontrolled moral degradation affecting all realms of everyday life. These problems have profound spiritual causes and thus require a spiritual perspective. Discover the origin of the new Divine Invitation and the specific solutions it offers for todays major world problems." />
