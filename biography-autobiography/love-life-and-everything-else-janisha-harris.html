  <title>Love, Life and Everything Else - Janisha Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Dad
Hey dad if you&#39;re listening
this poem is for you
just writting to let you know
all the things life has put me through
strangers somehow have a tendacy
to try to take your place
but they can&#39;t do it, it&#39;s impossible
the pain could never be erased
they can&#39;t fill
this emotional viod in my heart
inside I still wonder
why must we stand so far apart
my mom&#39;s got a new man
he used to treat her right
why she stays with him, I don&#39;t understand
because now all they do is fight
it&#39;s not like I grew up
a completely fatherless kid
but he can&#39;t make up
for all the birthdays and christmases you missed
he tries a little bit
but the job wasn&#39;t made for him to do
sometimes it&#39;s too hard not to cry
cause he&#39;s no you
so why did he have to be the one
to see off my first day of school
he even took me to the dentist 
when I lost my first tooth
so dad 
where you at my graduation
no way to go
not even a congratulations
so tell me 
will you be there to help me blow out my sixthteen candles
sometimes life gets hard
and the pain is too much to handle
I&#39;m a big girl now
so I hold my tears inside
I already had my first kiss
and you were never there to teach me about guys
you never took me shopping
or fishing
you just left me hoping
and wishing
but you can&#39;t always get what you wish for
and dreams don&#39;t always come true
he taught me that
but we both know he&#39;s no you
The End" />
