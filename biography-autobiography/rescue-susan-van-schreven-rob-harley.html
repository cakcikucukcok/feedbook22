The babies would turn up at the hospital perfectly healthy and slowly, but surely, become disabled, both mentally and physically. Sue&amp;#39;s empathy with the children&amp;#39;s plight was real and palpable and what was so impressive was that she extended that empathy toward the parents who had abandoned their children. - Jan Bowron, Journalist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this book will help you to count the cost of your dream, be bold, and launch out into the deep. - Sue van Schreven&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow... your incredible energy, commitment and vision have really paid off - proof that one person can make a world of difference!
