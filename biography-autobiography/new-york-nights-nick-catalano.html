  <title>New York Nights - Nick Catalano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;New York Nights&lt;/I&gt; shares the personal experiences, gossipy anecdotes, and critical commentary of a television and concert producer who has been firmly entrenched in the exciting and unpredictable comedy and jazz scene in a city that never sleeps.&lt;P&gt;
Producer Nick Catalano introduced early audiences to the comedy of Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Maher, Richard Lewis, Robert Klein, Larry David, Sam Kinison, Ray Romano, and many others. In this compelling collection of stories, Catalano reminisces about how these comedians started in the business and also includes details about the hangouts of jazz legends like Miles Davis, Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, and Max Roach. A reviewer and essayist, Catalano shares his night club observations on the performances of such well-known singers as Rosemary Clooney, Johnny Mathis, and Mel Torm and his critical commentary on the writing of luminaries such as Dorothy Parker, H.L. Mencken and Budd Schulberg.  For those who have never experienced the excitement of sitting in an aisle seat at the Metropolitan Opera, Catalano deftly recreates the scene and what it is like to witness  the magic and incredible talent of Placido Domingo and Therese Stratas. &lt;P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;New York Nights&lt;/I&gt; puts its finger on the pulse of an incredible and vast cultural landscape and offers an intriguing and entertaining behind-the-scenes look at a world like no other.&lt;P&gt;" />
