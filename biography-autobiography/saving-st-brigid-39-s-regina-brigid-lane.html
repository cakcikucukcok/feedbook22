  <title>Saving St Brigid&#39;s - Regina Brigid Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the top of a hill in south-west Victoria, surrounded by rolling green hills that fall&lt;br /&gt;
away to the Southern Ocean, sits a grand old red-brick church. For more than 150&lt;br /&gt;
years, these fertile volcanic fields have sustained the largest rural population of Irish&lt;br /&gt;
descent in Australia. Built and paid for by the children of potato-famine survivors,&lt;br /&gt;
St Brigid&amp;rsquo;s is a symbol of faith and hope in an ancient land, by a cold, wild sea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2009, the Catholic Church put the church and hall up for sale, against the wishes&lt;br /&gt;
of the local community. What began as a small local issue soon became a national&lt;br /&gt;
news story, in a battle that went all the way to Rome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Saving St Brigid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;/em&gt;is the truly unique story of a small Australian rural community who,&lt;br /&gt;
in the spirit of their Irish rebel ancestors, stood up for what they believed in. Their&lt;br /&gt;
fight for justice awakened the author to the richness of her Irish Catholic culture,&lt;br /&gt;
and its lasting legacy on the community, and the Church, she grew up in. Through&lt;br /&gt;
the lens of her Irish heritage and that of the local Indigenous people, she weaves&lt;br /&gt;
together a lyrical narrative of song and story, and discovers just how much our&lt;br /&gt;
ancestral traditions have to teach us if we are to transform the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;" />
