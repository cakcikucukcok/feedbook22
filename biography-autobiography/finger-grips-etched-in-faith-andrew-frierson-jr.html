  <title>Finger Grips Etched in Faith - Andrew Frierson, Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="King Solomon, in his great wisdom, said, There is a time for everything under the sun. The life experiences of Andrew Frierson, author of &lt;i&gt;Finger Grips Etched in Faith: Staying the Course of Life,&lt;/i&gt; show Solomons words to be true on the most personal, immediate level. Frierson experienced childhood during the Great Depression, dropped out of high school to enlist in the army, served as a minister and school administrator, and battled and eventually survived cancer. &lt;i&gt;Finger Grips Etched in Faith&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the details of his life while reflecting on the culture of work, the value of family, and the power, love, and wisdom of God.
Friersons compelling narrative, depicting the path of his life, offers inspiration for everyone, but particularly for those of us facing the specter of catastrophic illness and the intense changes that come with age. By embracing spirituality, faith, and survival, Frierson found revelation, enlightenment, and the ability to restore joy to post-cancer life. 
Despite inner or outer opposition, we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; walk through life with dignity and resolvewe need only pause to listen and accept the wisdom we are given." />
