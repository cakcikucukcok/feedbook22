  <title>Nori:  the Story of a Deaf Honduran Orphan and the Goodness of God - Robert K. Rittenhouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There comes a time when each of us must decide to heed Gods call to action and join Him in His divine work. This is the story of Bob and Pat Rittenhouses&#39;s answer to that call. True religion, as defined by Scripture, is to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world (James 1:27, NKJV). Taking this verse to heart, the Rittenhouses decided to open their hearts and home to a deaf child. In His mysterious but wonderful way, God brought Nori and the Rittenhouses together. What follows is the journey that Bob, Pat, and Nori traveled as they became a family. It is a beautiful story of Gods grace and love. Having known the Rittenhouses for a number of years, I can attest to the blessing that Bob and Pat have been to Nori as well as the blessing Nori has been to each person she meets. May God use this book to challenge each of us to answer His call and show His love in a world that is in such desperate need.
