  <title>All Valiant Dust - Peter Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For many of its participants, the Second World War was the most intense period of their lives - with horizons widened by grief, strangeness and excitement. Peter Ross, graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, to become a troop commander in Montgomery&#39;s Eighth Army. He took ship to Egypt and was active in the Western Desert campaign, concluding with El Alamein, a memorable and historic battle which marked the turning-point of the war. Hospitalized and awarded the Military Cross, Ross returned to take part in the D-Day landings, the liberation of Brussels and the advance on the Rhine .All Valiant Dust is a young Irishman&#39;s experience of war, vividly recounted with compassion and humour. Its painfully realized remembrance of the din and tempo of desert conflict, and much besides, documents extraordinary times." />
