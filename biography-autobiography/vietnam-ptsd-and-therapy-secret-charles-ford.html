  <title>Vietnam, Ptsd, and Therapy - Secret Charles-Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What the book will containThe book will talk about mental health and the importance of therapy. It will describe the life experiences of a veteran that is dissatisfied with the treatment he has received. It is about a stressed out Veteran with a dysfunctional brain. It is about PTSD and hang-ups. It is about a family that is living with PTSD. This book offers strategies for dealing with PTSD. This book examines Steves life upon entering the military, his experiences while serving in the military, and what his life was like after serving. Its time for the world to know about PTSD. Its urgent that we all know about PTSD. Its time to be unified about PTSD. What is PTSD?
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can occur after you have been through a traumatic event. A traumatic event is something horrible and scary that you see or that happens to you. During this type of event, you think that your life or others&#39; lives are in danger. You may feel afraid or feel that you have no control over what is happening.
Why you should read itThis book is for families with veterans diagnosed with PTSD. This book is for the clinically diagnosed veterans and their families, too many of our marriages are strained and end in divorce. A more diverse bank of resources should be offered to husbands, wives, and families that have to deal with issues regarding war, the military, and PTSD.
How you could possibly relate to this book or how it could helpPTSD is like a volcano that is about to erupt. This book provides the reader with better insight as to what the veteran is dealing with, more understanding about the problems, and the knowledge about how one veteran survived. There is a part of America that everyone does not know. 
&quot;If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes. Andrew Carnegie" />
