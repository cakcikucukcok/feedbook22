  <title>Benevolent Extraterrestrial Guides - Hermaneli Torrevillas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author shares many encounters that made him lean towards the studies of intuitive feelings as well as the psychic phenomena that relate to the mystifying world of the unknown. He had been in the quandary in his early years regarding the paranormal happenings in his life. Rather than ignore them as skeptics do, Torrevillas regarded them with more significance in his life.
Author:  &lt;b&gt;Did the voice that talked to me when I was 20 years old, the possession by a spirit when I was 30, the appearance of Jesus Christ in the cloud when I was 48, and a lot more, were done by an extraterrestrial beings?   The two humanoid angels that saved me when I had undergone open heart surgery?  The being that grabbed my hair and pulled my leg recently was the same guide that had watched me throughout my life?&lt;/b&gt;   
&lt;b&gt;At 75 years of age, it was clear that benevolent extraterrestrials had guided me through the years. Now I am called to write this book.&lt;/b&gt;
The famous American Sleeping prophet, Edgar Cayce, said the past, present and the future are one. In the future we will live and see the beauty of the Universe in this infinite cycle of time- space.  &lt;b&gt;But we are hindered in our quest for truth!  From Who?  You will find the answer in this Book.&lt;/b&gt;" />
