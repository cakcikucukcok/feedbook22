  <title>One Place in Time - Ginger Marshall Martus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;One Place in Time&lt;/i&gt; tells a tale of growing up in an American shipyard in the middle of the twentieth century. Author Ginger Marshall Martus is the oldest surviving member of her familys shipyard team; now, she shares an insiders recollection of an era long past. Her father, Raymond E. Marshall, was the founder and owner of this well-known shipyard.
From 1928 to 1968, the A&amp;R Marshall, Inc. shipyard was one of the largest and most successful marine supply and service yards on the Atlantic seaboard. Martus recalls both the colorful boats and the even more colorful craftsmen who built and maintained them. 
Even so, this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the story about yet another pretty boat, boat designer, or builder. Rather, it is the story of the people who serviced and took care of the crafts the designers and builders created for many of the legendary yachting personalities of the 1930s, 40s and 50s. 
This memoir is filled with nostalgic remembrances of a special place on a splendid time. Working from taped interviews with of interesting and distinguished nautical figures, Martus has crafted this very personal memoir to preserve the golden age of her region. There is a growing interest in recapturing these colorful times, from restorations of old boats to building replicas of maritime preservation as a whole, and Martus shares these stories to capture the imagination of a new generation of ship enthusiasts." />
