  <title>From the Inside - Russ DiBella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1978, when music found its way into Russ DiBellas life largely by way of external circumstances, a natural progression of sorts began to unfold which would eventually marry his affection for words with a nascent interest in drumming and lyric writing. What began as a teenage rite of passage  his first rock concert  would spawn a lifelong passion for all things music, manifesting itself in ways both deliberate and unanticipated.
Part memoir and part backstage pass, From the Inside is actually written from the perspective of an outsider looking in  although very often and surreptitiously from within. With a detailed history of how music became such an actively integral part of his life (even before an awareness of his parents unintended influence) and an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at several concerts (to include a respectable gathering of drumsticks along the way), DiBella recounts with enthusiasm and occasional humility more than thirty years of experiences as admirer, accomplice and collector.
Less a narrative about unofficial access to rock stars, From the Inside sneaks a peek behind the proverbial curtain to discover some of the inner workings of live concerts. Meeting drum techs, guitar techs and other assorted crew and band members and observing load-ins, soundchecks and even a few shows from the other side of the stage offers an intimate look at activities otherwise inaccessible to the typical concert-goer. Not wanting for moments of rocknroll flash, encounters with rockers Mick Jagger, Eddie Van Halen and Neil Peart as well as country artists Brad Paisley and Montgomery Gentry among many others provide additional insight and add elements of celebrity to this otherwise personal account.
Clearly written with an appreciation both for music and those artists whove inspired, From the Inside is the story of a life examined through the lens of music." />
