  <title>My Son...His Father...And I... - Ekaterini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You know, one day your son is going to ask you what
happened. Anna said as she was driving.
You know what you should do?
What?
Write a book. When Leo gets older and the questions start,
youll just have to reach for the bookcase and voila.
I knew she was right. Infl uences and time, restructure and distort events in the human mind to suit each persons contemporary life style; hencerelative truth... unless they were documented early enough. An autobiography, a testimonial to human interaction... interesting.She momentarily looked at me through the rear view mirror, her eyes were smiling. I was grinning too. The concoction felt almost sinister.
Ekaterini was born in Melbourne, Australia, to migrant Greek parents. When she was three and a half years of age, the family which also included a brother, decided to migrate back to Greece and establish a rabbit farm. The business failed and at the age of seven, she and her family returned to Australia again with only the proverbial suitcase. Within five years another two siblings were added to the clan. For a long time
the family just made ends meet. 
Living in a city and with the aid of free public education she managed to complete a Bachelors Degree in Microbiology, Cell Biology and Genetics. Due to the inability to fi nd work she returned to school and became a high school teacher for Mathematics. Blessed with an artistic fl are she was also commissioned to paint numerous murals and canvas paintings over a twenty year span. Throughout her life she has worked in the country and city areas dealing with fast food outlets, factories (book binding and manufacturing electrical goods),
schools (teacher, lab technician and library technician), tutoring, being an artist, handy woman (painting, tiling, plumbing etc)and mother. Writing began at the age of ten when she wrote her first poem. She has travelled to Europe over ten times and with the moto, Tomorrow is another day, life is manageable and...never boring." />
