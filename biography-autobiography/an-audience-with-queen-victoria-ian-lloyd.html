  <title>An Audience with Queen Victoria - Ian Lloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of Britain&#39;s most famous and longest serving rulers, Queen Victoria saw widespread change across the planet. During her sixty-three-year reign, in which she became one of the most powerful and influential people in the world, Victoria met everyone from Charlotte Brontë to Buffalo Bill; she had opinions on all those who graced her parlour – and some who didn&#39;t.
An Audience With Queen Victoria examines the meetings and letters exchanged between the queen and a veritable who&#39;s who of her time. It draws on often brutal character assessments in her journals and letters – Henry &#39;Dr Livingstone I presume&#39; Stanley was &#39;a determined ugly little Man&#39;. Exploring those she met officially and personally – even the seven men who tried to assassinate her – and her thoughts on figures of the time such as Jack the Ripper, Ian Lloyd unlocks a fascinating aspect of Victoria&#39;s character and outlook. Through brand-new archival research, newspapers and interviews with descendants, sit alongside Victoria and experience queenship as she did for the first time." />
