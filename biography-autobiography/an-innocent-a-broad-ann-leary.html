  <title>An Innocent, a Broad - Ann Leary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Ann Leary and her husband, then unknown actor-comedian Denis Leary, flew to London in the early nineties for a brief getaway during Ann&#39;s second trimester of pregnancy, neither anticipated the adventure that was in store for them. The morning after their arrival, Ann&#39;s water broke as they strolled through London&#39;s streets. A week later their son, Jack, was born weighing only two pounds, six ounces, and it would be five long months before mother and son could return to the States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Ann became an unwitting yet grateful hostage to Britain&#39;s National Health Service -- a stranger in a strange land plunged abruptly into a world of breast pumps and midwives, blood oxygen levels, mad cow disease, and poll tax riots. Desperately worried about the health of her baby, Ann struggled to adapt to motherhood and make sense of a very different culture. At once an intimate family memoir, a lively travelogue, and a touching love story, &lt;strong&gt;An Innocent, a Broad&lt;/strong&gt; is utterly engaging and unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
