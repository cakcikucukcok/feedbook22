  <title>The Bridge Ladies - Betsy Lerner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A fifty-year-old Bridge game provides an unexpected way to cross the generational divide between a daughter and her mother. Betsy Lerner takes us on a powerfully personal literary journey, where we learn a little about Bridge and a lot about life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a lifetime defining herself in contrast to her mother&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;don&amp;#8217;t ask, don&amp;#8217;t tell&amp;#8221; generation, Lerner finds herself back in her childhood home, not five miles from the mother she spent decades avoiding. When Roz needs help after surgery, it falls to Betsy to take care of her. She expected a week of tense civility; what she got instead were the Bridge Ladies. Impressed by their loyalty, she saw something her generation lacked. Facebook was great, but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t deliver a pot roast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tentatively at first, Betsy becomes a regular at her mother&amp;#8217;s Monday Bridge club. Through her friendships with the ladies, she is finally able to face years of misunderstandings and family tragedy, the Bridge table becoming the common ground she and Roz never had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turns darkly funny and deeply moving, &lt;em&gt;The Bridge Ladies&lt;/em&gt; is the unforgettable story of a hard-won&amp;#8212;but never-too-late&amp;#8212;bond between mother and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
