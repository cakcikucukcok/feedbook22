  <title>Always Another Country - Sisonke Msimang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;        Lead title with 100,000 AFP
&lt;li&gt;        South African author Sisonke Msimang is one of the most exciting contemporary female black voices in literature.
&lt;li&gt;        Her work frequently appears in publications such as The New York Times, The Guardian and the Huffington Post .
&lt;li&gt;        Her TED Talk “If a story moves you, act on it” was watched over 1 million times
&lt;li&gt;        Always Another Country is already a bestseller in South Africa
&lt;li&gt;        Sisonke was born in exile as the daughter of South African political activists – she first set foot in her home country as a teenager
&lt;li&gt;        An intimate story of exile and homecoming, her memoir is a story of growing up in exile and interweaves her personal story with her political awakening in America and Africa, her euphoria at returning to the new South Africa, and her disillusionment with the new elites.
&lt;li&gt;        Sisonke has lived in Zambia, Kenya and Canada and attended Macalester College in Saint Paul 
&lt;li&gt;        For fans of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie – Sisonke is an outspoken, race-conscious feminist and political activist. 
&lt;li&gt;        Trevor Noah’s memoir Born a Crime about growing up during apartheid in South Africa is a huge bestseller – the timing for this title is excellent! 
&lt;li&gt;        Amazing endorsements including from Graca Machel, Nelson Mandela&#39;s widow and former first lady of South Africa" />
