  <title>More Than Bipolar - Lizabeth D. Schuch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A valuable book, fresh with insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Earley, author of Crazy: A Fathers Search Through Americas Mental Health Madness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until she experienced her first manic episode at the age of seventeen, author Lizabeth D. Schuch had little knowledge of mental illness. From that point on, her life would never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her memoir, &lt;i&gt;More Than Bipolar&lt;/i&gt;, she discusses her twenty-five years of experience with bipolar disorder, sharing the wisdom attained to break the hold of stigma, shame, and fear surrounding this illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schuch reveals the full reality of what living with this illness looks like. She shares the truth, from its manic and depressive extremes to the life lessons of understanding and maturity necessary to live well in recovery. More Than Bipolar also provides information about the importance of getting a proper diagnosis, working with the medical  providers, trusting your own instincts about your care, and having the insight to know when the warning signs are leading you in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;More Than Bipolar&lt;/i&gt; focuses on knowledge gained and strength restored on the path of a complete bipolar journey. It shows that living well with bipolar disorder is possible and may indeed be a part of the diagnostic picture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
