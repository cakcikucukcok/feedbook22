      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Pray Hard &amp; Speak Life, Cliff Powell&#39;s story is a crystal-clear picture of the hope and restoration that is only found in Jesus!  Every page drips with real life mixed with grace, forgiveness, love, and hope!  You will not only be encouraged and challenged but you will also be reminded that life with Jesus is an adventure with a beautiful, expected end!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Acton Bowen, bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Beautifully written, Pray Hard &amp; Speak Life will lift your spirits and inspire your soul. It takes you on a journey through the most intimate, heart-wrenching experiences a young man could possibly endure. He was able to overcome a lifetime of trials and tribulations through his trust in God and love of family. His heart&#39;s on fire with a burning desire to help others who may be going through their own setbacks in life by helping them learn to pray hard and speak life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Sharon Schuler Kreps, author of Jokers &amp; Dandies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&#39;s a financial struggle, physical ailment, or emotional tragedy, you have the ability to determine if the battle you face will be lost or won.  In Pray Hard &amp; Speak Life, the author reflects on some of the most challenging battles he has faced and how one friend who became the love of his life stayed by his side through it all, only to become the victim of a battle that taught him how to pray hard and speak life.  This memoir walks the reader down a road covered with scenery that displays the best and the worst of the author&#39;s most private moments.  He shares how he was able to make the transformation from addiction to sobriety through the love of Jesus and how the real battle had just begun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
