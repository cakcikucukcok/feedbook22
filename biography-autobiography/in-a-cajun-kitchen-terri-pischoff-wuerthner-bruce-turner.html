  <title>In a Cajun Kitchen - Terri Pischoff Wuerthner, Bruce Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When most people think of Cajun cooking, they think of blackened redfish or, maybe, gumbo. When Terri Pischoff Wuerthner thinks of Cajun cooking, she thinks about Great-Grandfather Theodore&#39;s picnics on Lake Carenton, children gathering crawfish fresh from the bayou for supper, and Grandma Olympe&#39;s fricassee of beef, because Terri Pischoff Wuerthner is descended from an old Cajun family.  Through a seamless blend of storytelling and recipes to live by, Wuerthner&#39;s &lt;i&gt;In a Cajun Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; will remind people of the true flavors of Cajun cooking.  &lt;br&gt;            When her ancestors settled in Louisiana around 1760, her family grew into a memorable clan that understood the pleasures of the table and the bounty of the Louisiana forests, fields, and waters. Wuerthner spices her gumbo with memories of Cajun community dances, wild-duck hunts, and parties at the family farm. From the Civil War to today, Wuerthner brings her California-born Cajun family together to cook and share jambalaya, crawfish étoufée, shrimp boil, and more, while they cook, laugh, eat, and carry on the legacy of Louis Noel Labauve, one of the first French settlers in Acadia in the 1600s. &lt;br&gt;           Along with the memories, &lt;i&gt;In a Cajun Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; presents readers with a treasure trove of authentic Cajun recipes: roasted pork mufaletta sandwiches, creamy crab casserole, breakfast cornbread with sausage and apples, gumbo, shrimp fritters, black-eyed pea and andouille bake, coconut pralines, pecan pie, and much more. &lt;i&gt;In a Cajun Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; is a great work of culinary history, destined to be an American cookbook classic that home cooks will cherish.&lt;/p&gt;" />
