  <title>Where Men Only Dare to Go: Or the Story of a Boy Company, C.S.A. - Royall W. Figg, Robert K. Krick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;First published in 1885 and long out of print, &lt;i&gt;Where Men Only Dare to Go&lt;/i&gt; by Royall W. Figg remains a classic memoir of Confederate service. This updated edition, with a new foreword by historian Robert K. Krick, brings Figg&#39;s captivating narrative back into print. Figg tells the story of Captain William W. Parker&#39;s Virginia battery, a significant Confederate unit that participated in every important engagement fought by the Army of Northern Virginia. Comprised mainly of young men, it became known as &quot;Parker&#39;s Boy Battery.&quot; Figg joined the company at age twenty as a charter member at the battery&#39;s initial muster on March 14, 1862. He appears on each of the battery&#39;s fourteen bimonthly muster rolls from March 1862 to February 1865 -- an unusually devoted service record. His devotion is evident in the detailed accounting he provides of the battery&#39;s history, a vivid and engaging record of the experiences of a Confederate artillerist providing a rich blend of bravery, rascally behavior, and drollery. J. Thompson Brown, the last commander of Parker&#39;s Virginia Battery, described Figg as &quot;a fair representative of our Company, an intelligent fairly educated boy.... He was a truthful and Christian gentleman.... I believe what he says, as no man could doubt Royal W. Figg&#39;s statement.&quot; The reappearance of &lt;i&gt;Where Men Only Dare to Go&lt;/i&gt; after so many years offers a new generation a chance to read the eyewitness report of this bright, observant young soldier who fought through the famous battles in the eastern theater.&lt;/p&gt;" />
