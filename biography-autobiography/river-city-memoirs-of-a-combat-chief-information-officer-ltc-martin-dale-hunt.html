  <title>River City, Memoirs of a Combat Chief Information Officer - LTC Martin Dale Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In July 2006, Martin Hunt was a successful software sales professional with a wife, two sons, a happy life in Seattle, and a commitment to the U.S. Army that he was not sure he&#39;d ever be called on to fulfill. A year later he was a resident of Camp Ramadi, a dusty outpost at the epicenter of Operation Iraqi Freedom. A senior officer surrounded by young men charged with the highly dangerous task of clearing improvised explosive devices from supply routes, Hunt soon grew to dread the call &quot;River City&quot; - the code for incoming casualties. Trapped between his &quot;real&quot; life in Seattle, visited through Skype and a furlough that seemed over before it began, and the hell of &quot;River City,&quot; Hunt provides a window into the paradigm-shifting experience of deployment in the War on Terror: a story of faith, love, and life, interrupted." />
