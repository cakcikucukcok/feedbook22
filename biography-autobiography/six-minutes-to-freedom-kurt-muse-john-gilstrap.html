  <title>Six Minutes To Freedom - Kurt Muse, John Gilstrap</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear President Bush,&lt;br&gt;    My name is Kimberly Anne Muse. I am writing this letter not for me but for my father, Kurt Frederick Muse. As you should know by now, he is a political prisoner in Panama.  .  ..  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Born in the United States and raised in Panama, Kurt Muse grew up with a deep love for his adopted country. But the crushing regime of General Manuel Noriega in the late 1980s threatened his, and a nation&#39;s, freedom. A nightmare of murder and unexplained disappearances compelled Kurt and a few trusted friends to begin a clandestine radio campaign, urging the people of Panama to rise up for their basic human rights. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      &lt;i&gt;Six Minutes to Freedom &lt;/i&gt;is the remarkable tale of Kurt Muse&#39;s arrest and harrowing months of imprisonment; his eyewitness accounts of torture; and the plight of his family as they fled for their lives. It is also the heart-pounding account of the only American civilian ever rescued by the elite Delta Force. Timelier than ever, this is a thrilling and highly personal narrative about one man&#39;s courage and dedication to his beliefs.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &quot;A cliffhanger drama of survival against all odds.&quot;  --Jeffery Deaver&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &quot;A dramatic portrayal of idealism, courage, integrity, and fortitude.&quot;  --John Douglas and Mark Olshaker  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A must-read for anyone interested in how Delta Force operates.&quot;  --John Weisman  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Harrowing, entertaining, inspiring, and very, very readable.&quot;  --Col. Lee A. Van Arsdale, U.S. Army Special Forces (Ret)  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A thrilling chronicle that puts a human face on unspeakable actions.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Continental &lt;/i&gt;magazine  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Featured Alternate of the Military Book Club&lt;/b&gt;" />
