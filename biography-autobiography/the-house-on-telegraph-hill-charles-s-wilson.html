  <title>The House on Telegraph Hill - Charles S. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The doors of the house inhabited by the Jack Wilson family on Telegraph Hill lead to a terrible secret. Within those walls, Charles S. Wilson and his sisters suffered heartbreaking physical and mental abuse at the hands of their own parents.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Mother Mame was a well-known caretaker in the community, but she also brought strangers into the house and force-fed them until they were sick. Their father Jack, better known as the town drunk, threw Wilson around like a rag doll for the amusement of his drunken friends. And then there were Annabelle and Abigail, Wilson&#39;s beloved sisters, whose neglected and tortured lives ended all too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story of survival, &lt;I&gt;The House on Telegraph Hill&lt;/I&gt;, details the abuse Wilson suffered and sheds light, not only on his own demoralizing experience, but also on the epidemic of child abuse. His brutally honest stories reveal all of the disguises, sugar-coatings, and lies that abusers heap on their victims. By recounting his dreadful upbringing along with his lifelong struggles, Wilson is finally pushing his story to the forefront to help educate others about the horrors and complexities of child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
