  <title>The Madness Within - Terri L. Whitley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As I awoke from a dream, I realized the importance of my book to its readers. I also realized what makes this book different from other books that have tried to re-create the essence of &quot;The Madness Within&quot;.   &quot;The Madness Within&quot; is not just a collection of thoughts and experiences but it is my own personal account of the miracles that have occurred in my life to bring me to this very purposeful point along the journey of &quot;life&quot;. This book contains miracles that can inspire others to overcome the challenges in their own lives.  This book shows how I overcame insurmountable odds, ignored family members who told me to give up on my dream of becoming a doctor, and how I survived possible death from a drug poisoning my body. Despite all of these problems and after several hospitalizations, somehow I still managed to graduate from pharmacy school, pass my board exams on the first try, and not only become a pharmacist but eventually a pharmacy manager, shortly after graduation. My life changed dramatically within a few years.  I want to share my story so others can know that there is hope for anyone who is willing to take a step of faith in the right direction.  
Sometimes, I dont like or understand the challenges that I must  endure before the &quot;miracles&quot; but,  like everyone else in this world, I realize that the miracle is just around the corner.
Finally, I realized that success with the publication of this book is not measured in sales but in the number of lives that have been improved, hearts that have been mended, and families that have been restored. Although I will probably never really know
how successful my book is according to these parameters, I know that the impact of this book on the lives of others, this is the true measure of success.
THE MADNESS WITHIN is the personal account of a yielded vessel of God; including journal entries and a detailed pharmacological history which highlights medications taken upon discharge from each hospitalization and summarizes major life events." />
