  <title>Love and Terror on the Howling Plains of Nowhere: A Memoir - Poe Ballantine, Cheryl Strayed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Fans of Truman Capote&#39;s &lt;I&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/I&gt; and John Berendt&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&lt;/I&gt; will embrace Poe Ballantine&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Love and Terror on the Howling Plains of Nowhere.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For well over twenty years, Poe Ballantine traveled America, taking odd jobs, living in small rooms, and wondering the big whys. At age 46, he finally settled with his Mexican immigrant wife in Chadron, Nebraska, where they had a son who was red-flagged as autistic. Poe published four books about his experiences as a wanderer and his observations of America. But one day in 2006, his neighbor, Steven Haataja, a math professor from the local state college disappeared. Ninety five days later, the professor was found bound to a tree, burned to death in the hills behind the campus where he had taught. No one, law enforcement included, understood the circumstances. Poe had never contemplated writing mystery or true crime, but since he knew all the players, the suspects, the sheriff, the police involved, he and his kindergarten son set out to find out what might have happened.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
