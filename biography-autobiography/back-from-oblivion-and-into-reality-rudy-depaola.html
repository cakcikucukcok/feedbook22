  <title>Back from Oblivion and into Reality - Rudy DePaola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    This is my second book. It is a sequel to my first book, Wings of the Bullet. It is called Back from Oblivion and into Reality. It is a continuation of the
    ongoing true story of Ralph (now I am using Rudy, my real nickname). Throughout history, teenagers like me have helped to bear the brunt of war. Many were
    killed. Others were wounded, some horribly. All, however, often came home to an unforgiving nation.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    In past wars, the young veterans came home from war and tried to blend into their new situations as best they could. Little lasting admiration or glory was
    theirs to help them through these difficult times of adjustment.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Not until the end of WWII did our nation realize the dedication and sacrifice of its returning veterans. The people opened their hearts in appreciation.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    The Veterans Administration (VA) and many local and state agencies passed important legislations for the returning vets. Our Congress passed the GI Bill of
    Rights, which educated an entire generation and made our country the great nation it is today . . .
    &lt;br/&gt;
    In my second book, my sequel, I continue the ongoing true story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Changes of Fate
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    During my lifetime, I have had experiences that had suddenly changed the direction of my life. I call them changes of fate.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    An example of this is in my first book, Wings of the Bullet. When I was seventeen, my friend and I and another boy, who wanted to come along with us, went
    to enlist in the navy; but without any intention to do so, we enlisted in the Army Air Corps. Years later, when I was in college, a bottle of beer changed
    me from being an accountant into being a teacher. When you read this book, you will learn how this happened.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Think about your own life. Have you ever experienced a change of fate? If so, take note and think about other changes of fate you may have experienced. I
    began to identify more and more incidents that seemed to change the direction of my life. As you read my books, try doing the same. You may even want to
    make a list of them as I have started to do.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    I began to wonder, are these really real experiences or just a change of luck? Or are they a matter of coincidence or maybe your imagination, or could they
    be an act of divine providence? What do you think?
    &lt;br/&gt;
