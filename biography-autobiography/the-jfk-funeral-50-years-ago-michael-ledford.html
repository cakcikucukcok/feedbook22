  <title>The Jfk Funeral 50 Years Ago - Michael Ledford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;NOVEMBER 22, 2013, marks the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the thirty-fifth president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of us who lived through that great national tragedy we are now compelled to tell something to the next generation. I have a very unique, but perhaps many would say, insignificant personal story concerned going to his funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a professional author. I am a retired high school biology teacher - one of over a million average citizens who went to Washington. At my age I still feel an emotional connection to John F. Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a college student when he was assassinated on that Friday, November 22, 1963. On Sunday night, after listening to the media&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coverage, three others and myself on a double date decided impulsively to go from Ohio to Washington to see the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many unseen problems on this trip. It ended up being almost more than four naive students could handle - but we did make the trip and got back safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later I have decided to tell the personal story of this trip. I still have detailed information from my diary, two letters that were written after the trip and other notes that I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to put all of this information together and tell the story of a unique adventure I took as a young man. Please let me share this with you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
