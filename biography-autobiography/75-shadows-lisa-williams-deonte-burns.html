  <title>75 Shadows - Lisa Williams, Deonte Burns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THIS BOOK HAS BEEN FORMATTED IN THE RUBIX READ FORMAT. THE RUBIX READ PROVIDES MULTIPLE BEGINNINGS TO ONE ENDING WITHOUT CONFUSION. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO READ THEN FLIP THIS BOOK FROM FRONT COVER(START OF LISA&#39;S BIOGRAPHY) TO THE BACK COVER(START OF DEONTE&#39;S BIOGRAPHY). TWO WELL COMPOSED AUTOBIOGRAPHIES LEADING TO THE TRUE LOVE STORY IN THE CENTER OF THE BOOK.
BOTH STORIES WERE DIFFICULT TO TELL CONSIDERING TO PAIN AND MENTAL STRUGGLE TIED TO THE LIVES OF THE AUTHORS. COMPARE THE BACKGROUNDS OF THESE YOUNG AUTHORS AND FIND YOUR OWN EMOTIONAL BOND.
WHY IS THE INTERSTATE IMPORTANT? WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU?
HIGHWAY PATROL, FAMILY VACATIONS, BUSINESS TRIPS, EVERYDAY COMMUTE, ROADKILL, THE SCENERY, CAR ACCIDENTS, AAA, SEATBELTS, DRUG TRAFFIC, ETC... EVERY VEHICLE ON THE INTERSTATE HAS ITS OWN STORY TO TELL. I-75, I GUESS, AT A BIRDS EYE VIEW LOOKS LIKE AN ADVANCE ANT FARM. IT HAS ALL THOSE DIFFERENT AGENDAS CO-EXISTING. A RIPPLE CAN BE DUE TO WEATHER, A DRIVER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OR SHORT A FEW HOURS OF SLEEP, CONSTRUCTION, SO FORTH AND SO ON. WHO KNOWS WHEN THEIR JOURNEY WILL BE OVER? LIFE DOESN&#39;T COME WITH A NAVIGATOR HELPING YOU TO YOUR DESTINATION WITH THE LUXURIES OF AVOIDING DETOURS, TRAFFIC JAMS, COLLISION, ROAD RAGE AND VITAL CHAIN REACTION. THE INTERSTATE NEVER TURNS OFF AND NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO YOUR SHADOW FOLLOWS. WHO WANTS TO LOOK BACK AT UGLY SHADOWS WHEN YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO KEEP GOING? WOULD YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR IF YOU KNEW THE DEVIL WAS BEHIND YOU? SOME WOULD LOOK OUT OF CURIOSITY VERSUS BEING STARTLED OR CAUGHT OFF GUARD.
