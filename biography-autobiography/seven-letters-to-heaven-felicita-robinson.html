  <title>Seven Letters to Heaven - Felicita Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seven Letters To Heaven - Award-Winning Finalist in the &quot; Spirituality: Inspirational&quot; category - The 2012 International Book Awards and USA &quot;Best Books 2011&quot; Awards. Author Felicita Terry Robinson found herself at a spiritual crossroads as she was faced with the daunting task of uprooting herself and her family from their native Jamaica. For her, writing her prayers down gave her a sense of solace and the strength to accomplish her goals.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In her new book, Seven Letters to Heaven  A True Story of Faith and Answered Prayers (published by iUniverse), Robinson shares with readers seven of 21 personal letters of prayer she wrote as a way of communicating to God to seek His help with the small day-to-day problems she was experiencing. After looking back on her letters, she realized that not only were her prayers answered, her faith was also strengthened, leading her to wanting to share her experience with others. I have always felt that there was something missing that I needed to do spiritually other than being a good Christian, said Robinson. I realized that the actual publishing of my personal letters was the missing piece that I needed, not only to help others, but in order to help me grow spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking place during the last four months Robinson was in Jamaica prior to relocating to the U.S., Seven Letters to Heaven is about the trials and tribulations that came as a result of leaving home to start a new life, and the problems inherent with moving from one country to another. The book focuses on Robinsons written letters of prayers to God, sharing her day-to-day problems as well as poems and biblical quotations, and finding peace through her powerful faith. The story behind Seven Letters to Heaven is a simple one; however the message is very powerful. This book will take readers on a walk of faith that shows God can truly become a real friend to anyone and most importantly, He does answer prayers, in His own way, in His own time and at His own will. Review Comment by Rev. Basil Aguzie, MSP follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Faith, hope and courage are virtues every Christian on a spiritual journey with God must have. Seven Letters to Heaven confirms this. This book is not just about communicating with God through letter writing but also, it is a spiritual process of seeking God in ones situation and recognizing His hands at work in ones life; firstly in the means by which God answers ones prayers, and secondly the times when He actually does so. What is remarkable about this book is that it not only serves as a guide, but also an easy to read spiritual companion. This is why I would recommend it to anyone searching for a deeper intimacy with God.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;" />
