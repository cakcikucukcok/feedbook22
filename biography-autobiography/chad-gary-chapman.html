  <title>Chad - Gary Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This book is not just the story of an amazing young man&#39;s life journey....it&#39;s much more than that.
This is a labour of love by a proud father.  A touching tribute to his son&#39;s courage, his love of family, and his commitment to his God.  
It is a celebration of a life well lived.&quot;
- Suzanne Faull, Chaplain, Expatriate Support Ministries
&quot;Around Newcastle are many homes built and renovated by my friend Chad.  When he wasn&#39;t swinging a hammer for clients, he was hard at work building a life around him.
This year Chad began building his family a new house.
Chad was in hospital when they last raced at Bathurst.  He was thin and in pain, but laughed as he talked about cars and fishing and his suffering and faith.  He always clung to hope, to a miracle.  Although he couldn&#39;t eat his meal, he was concerned I hadn&#39;t had dinner.
His last words were &quot;Jesus, wow.&quot;
- Bruce Quirey, Senior Journalist, Newcastle Herald
&quot;The story of Chad is very moving and inspiring.  Publishing it will not only give justice to the wonderful life he lived, but will  also leave a legacy to those who know him and to those who will know him through his book.  I just felt that this book can make a difference to the lives of other people when it&#39;s out in the market.  What a birthday present would this be for Chad.  I know he is very happy in the presence of the Lord knowing that he is cherished by his loving family for the wonderful life he lived.  Truly enough he will be 33 years old forever which is a very significant number for the Saviour.&quot;
