  <title>Faith—It’S Voice Activated - Amelia Nazer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Some may believe that once you have faith, that is all there is. You are or are not a believer. But like life in general, ones spiritual journey is a process of growth. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For author Amelia Nazer, an encounter with Jesus was the beginning of a new relationship with Him. In her book, &lt;i&gt;FaithIts Voice Activated&lt;/i&gt;, she shares a few of her visions/dreams from Jesus and relates how they have impacted her life. She shares her personal journey of revelation in knowing the Creator in hope of helping you on your spiritual journey. She discovered that as her faith grew, Jesus revealed more of Himself. Using her personal experiences, Nazer guides you into developing faith on a higher level.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We all need visions and dreams that come with a true and deep faith. &lt;i&gt;FaithIts Voice Activated&lt;/i&gt; will help you to activate your faith by speaking it out. You will find the keys to growing closer to God and taking your relationship to another spiritual level of intimacy with our Father.&lt;/P&gt;" />
