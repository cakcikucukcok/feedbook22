  <title>Leukaemia - My Marathon for Love - Richard Woolley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have a five-inch scar on my chest, right hand side, pointing towards my heart. I look at it every day and it tells me who I am. 
If you are looking at this book wondering what its about, allow me to tell you. Its about one mans experience of leukaemia and all the fun and games that go with it. It is, more broadly, a book about life and a book about death. But greater still, this is a love story. A story about how true love cannot be destroyed by things as trivial as cancer and death. Some that remember me may do so in terms of my disease. That is to say, it will be the first thing they think of when they think of me and that I was taken so young. But the leukaemia that took me was not the defining force in my life, nor was it the strongest. That will always be love, and if I do say so myself, how we managed to get it so right in the brevity of our time together." />
