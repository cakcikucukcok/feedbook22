  <title>Saint Clement Hofbauer: His Writings and Spirituality - Raymond Corriveau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Saint Clement Mary Hofbauer led a life of devotion to Christ and to the teachings of Saint Alphonsus Liguori, the founder of the Redemptorist order. His mission in life, filled with passion and love of Christ, was one of deep religious conviction that changed the future of the Redemptorist order and continued to give special attention to the poor and most abandoned. Canonized on May 20, 1909, Saint Clement was a hermit and apostle with a strong personality and an unbending faith and love of Christ.Saint Clement has been called the second founder of the Redemptorist order because of his work to continue their founding principles. Building upon the foundation set by Saint Alphonsus, Saint Clement realized he needed to expand the Redemptorists from the Latin and Catholic work in Italy to the world, especially northern Europe. With an absolute faith in God, he worked tirelessly through the period in history defined by the French Revolution.Immediately following Saint Clement&#39;s death, the Redemptorists were granted approval to spread their mission to the Americas and subsequently to Asia and Africa. Without the faith of Saint Clement to follow God&#39;s will, the Redemptorist order would never have able to carry out their mission throughout the world and help millions of people to understand God&#39;s love.This twelve-chapter book includes a historical account of Saint Clement&#39;s life based on articles and letters translated from the original Spanish, German, Italian, or Greek. Also included are a map of places he went and a chronology of his sainted life. This book will appeal to historians and general readers interested in social justice and ministry to the poor.Paperback&quot;" />
