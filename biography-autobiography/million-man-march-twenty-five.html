  <title>Million Man March - Twenty-Five</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book gives an account of American History from the prospect of a black man born in the segregated south. The book lists experiences such as Ms. Rosa Parks refusing to sit on the back of the bus, the Montgomery bus boycott meetings where black people got together to help each other get to work without bus service, Dr. Martin Luther King marching through neighborhoods singing and gathering black people together for peaceful protest, and the Civil Rights Movement. The book also talks about the racist response to the movement from Klan members who promised to maintain segregation by controlling the law enforcement institutions through this quote: From now on you will not have to worry about Klansmen in white robes; we will now be wearing black robes. Meaning they will become judges, lawyers, and police officers. These events compelled the author to join the Million Man March." />
