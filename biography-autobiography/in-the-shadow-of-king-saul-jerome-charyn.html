  <title>In the Shadow of King Saul - Jerome Charyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;MAJOR WRITER ON MAJOR WRITERS: In the &lt;i&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;, Joyce Carol Oates expressed her admiration for her equally prolific contemporary: ?Among [Jerome] Charyn?s writerly gifts is a dazzling energy. . . . [He is] an exuberant chronicler of the mythos of American life?; the &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt; described him as ?absolutely unique among American writers?; and Michael Chabon calls him ?one of the most important writers in American literature.? In this collection, Charyn pays tribute to ?other writers, some celebrated, some forgotten. . . . All of these writers scalped me in some way, left their mark.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVOCATIVE SUBJECTS: In addition to crafting intimate portraits of his immigrant South Bronx family, Charyn tells stories about the politicians of Gotham, the heroes of negro league baseball, and the starlets of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Readers who enjoyed Charyn?s recently published popular novels fictionalizing the lives of Jerzy Kosinski, Abraham Lincoln, and Emily Dickinson will be eager to read his essays on Saul Bellow, Herman Melville, and Isaac Babel, while Jewish literature enthusiasts will appreciate his take on the Jewish diaspora and the connections he draws between himself and the biblical King Saul. Throughout, books themselves emerge as characters all readers will be drawn to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEMINAL ESSAYS, NOW BACK IN PRINT: The selected essays in this collection first appeared in magazines and newspapers, such as the &lt;i&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;, and in books now long out of print. Fans of Charyn?s work, and those just discovering this great American writer, will be delighted to have these essays gathered together for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW INSTALLMENT IN IMPORTANT SERIES: This will be the second title in Bellevue Literary Press?s The Art of the Essay series, which features compelling, creative nonfiction from accomplished writers of fiction, demonstrating the Bellevue Literary Press belief that fine literature knows no boundaries of genre or imagination. In addition to its general audience readership, this collection will be a superb addition to undergraduate creative writing and MFA courses.&lt;/p&gt;" />
