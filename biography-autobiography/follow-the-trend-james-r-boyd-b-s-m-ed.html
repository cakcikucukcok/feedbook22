  <title>Follow the Trend - James R. Boyd B.S. M.Ed.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The time spent completing this book was so enjoyable because during those thinking and writing hours, I was able to awaken many, many memories from my childhood and from later years as I grew into the person I have become. There are times when awakened memories elevate our spirits during rough periods, just as they often provide a chuckle when our lives are going well. And reminiscing about the good old days as well as the ones that were not so good can help any of us come to a better understanding of who and what we are today, and why.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Writing this book has given me peace of mind because of a promise I made to myself more than thirty years ago. It is not the intent of the book to teach anyone. I simply hope that by reading it, somewhere along the way someone just might be able to connect with the joy, the happiness, the sadness, and all of the other emotional ups and downs, included. We all face good times and bad times in life. While the details may vary from person to person, there is a commonality to our lives, which allows us to identify with the each other&#39;s highs and lows, successes and failures, trials and tribulations. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A section of the book discusses learning to think for oneself. Not thinking, or allowing those in the media and the political arena to fill our minds with lies or useless nonsense has become more prevalent in our society. A discussion of many of the tactics and techniques used to misinform, misguide, or misdirect the public is included with personal perspectives gained from decades of work, study, and thought.&lt;/P&gt;
