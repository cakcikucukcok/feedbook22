  <title>Torch - Dr. Linda Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was Friday eve: around three in the afternoon  a ringing phone. Wrong number, perhaps? My sister answered; who was she talking too? Who was the voice on the other end? Were they asking for someone? What was being spoken in her ear that caused her to be unable to speak? What had startled her so much that she completely froze? All time appeared to have stopped; surly the dial of Ahaz, the sun dial had gone back another ten degrees. For what appeared to be the longest moment in time, in a petrified voice, she finally spoke  hello, hello &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torch tells the story of a young adult who has an encounter with the One True GodEhyeh Asher Ehyehrendered I Am that I Am! Torch will set the record straight on the truth that God is the One true God of all Flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God commissioned Moses to be Israels liberator from the bondage of Pharaoh Egypt, he asked for Gods name in order to validate his God-given role to the children of Israel (Exodus 3:14). God simply answered Moses, Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh.   During my secret experience with the great I Am, God gave me two commands and a promise. KJV Proverbs 25:2 says: It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am one of the remaining Humanoids on planet Earth who can testify that the Creator Himself of the Universe does speak to Mankind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
