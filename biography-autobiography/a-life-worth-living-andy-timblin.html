  <title>A Life Worth Living - Andy Timblin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Several years ago while teaching an adult Sunday school class, a woman in the class said, Brother Timblin, you should write a book. I was sort of amused and said, Who would read a book that I would write? A man in the class answered, I would! That spoken word moved in my heart that day. Then just a couple of weeks ago after I had preached and was leaving the church shaking hands, a woman said to me, Brother Timblin, I love to hear you relating stories of your past ministry. When I told this to my daughter, she said, Why dont you write a book? At her word, the Holy Spirit moved my heart to write and I put the word foreword at the top of the first page. Realizing the fact that I am not a young man anymore, seventy-nine and having had some physical problems and along with taking care of my invalid wife who had a stroke three years ago, the devil said, Andy, youre too old to do that, too sick to do that, and too busy taking care of your wife to do that. But every time the devil brings negative thoughts, I know that those words are not from God, who is always positive and would not speak negatively to my spirit." />
