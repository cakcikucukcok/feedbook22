  <title>Recalculating - Amy Dempsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;RECALCULATING: Travels Along the Road Through Crisis is offered as comfort for the faithlessly faithful who frequently doubt they will find their way through lifes challenges. Although Amy Dempsey had a strong family history of breast cancer, she was still shocked to receive the same news. Her direction soon changed again when her beloved brother, Garry, was diagnosed with ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their detours became roads to places where many beliefs were tested and large and small lessons were learned; for example, keeping a hairdresser or a medical professional calm is definitely in a persons best interest anyone with scissors, a knife, or a needle is not the person to aggravate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support from others always provided the fuel needed to keep Amy on the right road. Joyful events were never diminished despite the difficulties and sorrows during these two years. Leaving a brother suffering in a nursing home on his fifty-fifth birthday was painful; however, her youngest childs performance at theater camp that same weekend was a blast! Writing about many contrasts helped bring clarity to emotions and a balance to life in this intimate memoir. &lt;/p&gt;" />
