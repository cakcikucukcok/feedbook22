  <title>Willing Warriors - Herbert Gager</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was December fifth in 1920 when life began in a place called Williston Park, Minnesota. My parents had come by Street Car from Minneapolis and by night time of that day in 1916 had erected a house in which three boys and a sister and mom and dad all slept. Dad called our two acre plot &quot;Hearts Desire&quot; and it was a place full of fun and love for us. Tragedy was there also, my sister passed away at the age of twelve she was truly missed as time went on. 
Music was a big part of our family life and mine with the oboe, clarinet and saxophones and the church choir as well. The Pillsbury Flour Mills Band started my musical career, later on I served in the US Marine Band, except in combat when we threw away the horn and picked up a stretcher to help the corpsmen." />
