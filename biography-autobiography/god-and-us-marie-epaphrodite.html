  <title>God and Us - Marie Epaphrodite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story of a woman who lost her parents at a young age but later on finds success through hard work, commitment, endurance and more importantly God&#39;s grace. Sometimes, when saved by grace, we tend to forget where that grace came from. We begin to make our own rules and this comes with a high price. This is what happened to the people of Israel which resulted to them spending forty years in the wilderness instead of just forty days. The author can relate to this and has found herself in a lot of difficult situations.
She then realized that when God says wait, he means for you to actually wait! Knowing that we have to wait on God is called Knowledge while the action of actually waiting is deemed as Wisdom. The healing of the Lord knows no boundaries. God will find you even to the pits of hell and he will deliver you from all evil.
This book aims to let the readers know that through life struggles, if we can trust God, He will see us through. In this book, there are many other chapters that people can relate to including useful subjects such as getting rid of poverty, achieving success, leadership and making a difference in the life that God has entrusted us with. The author hopes that the readers will enjoy reading this book!" />
