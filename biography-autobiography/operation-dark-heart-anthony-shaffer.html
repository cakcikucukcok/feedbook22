  <title>Operation Dark Heart - Anthony Shaffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On Friday, August 13, 2010, just as St. Martin&#39;s Press was readying its initial shipment of this book, the Department of Defense contacted us to express its concern that our publication of &lt;i&gt;Operation Dark Heart&lt;/i&gt; could cause damage to U.S. national security. After consulting with our author, we agreed to incorporate some of the government&#39;s changes into a revised edition of his book while redacting other text he was told was classified. The newly revised book keeps our national interests secure, but this highly qualified warrior&#39;s story is still intact. &lt;i&gt;Shaffer&#39;s assessment of successes and failures in Afghanistan remains dramatic, shocking, and crucial reading for anyone concerned about&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the outcome&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the war.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While I do not agree with the edits in many ways, the DoD redactions enhance the reader&#39;s understanding by drawing attention to the flawed results created by a disorganized and heavy handed military intelligence bureaucracy.&quot;  --Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer had run intelligence operations for years before he arrived in Afghanistan. He was part of the &quot;dark side of the force&quot;---the shadowy elements of the U.S. government that function outside the bounds of the normal system. His group called themselves the Jedi Knights and pledged to use the dark arts of espionage to protect the country from its enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaffer&#39;s mission to Afghanistan, however, was unlike any he had ever experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, he led a black-ops team on the forefront of the military efforts to block the Taliban&#39;s resurgence. They not only planned complex intelligence operations to beat back the insurgents, but also played a key role in executing those operations---outside the wire. They succeeded in striking at the core of the Taliban and their safe havens across the border in Pakistan. For a moment Shaffer saw us winning the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the military brass got involved. The policies that top officials relied on were hopelessly flawed. Shaffer and his team were forced to sit and watch as the insurgency grew---just across the border in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn&#39;t the first time he had seen bureaucracy stand in the way of national security. He had participated in Able Danger, the aborted intelligence operation that identified many of the future 9/11 terrorists but failed to pursue them. His attempt to reveal the truth to the 9/11 Commission would not go over well with his higher-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Operation Dark Heart&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of what really went on--and what went wrong--in Afghanistan. Shaffer witnessed firsthand the tipping point, when what seemed like certain victory turned into failure. Now, in this book, he maps out a way that could put us on the path to winning the war.&lt;/p&gt;" />
