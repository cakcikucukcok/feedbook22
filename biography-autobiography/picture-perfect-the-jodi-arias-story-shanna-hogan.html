  <title>Picture Perfect: The Jodi Arias Story - Shanna Hogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller by Shanna Hogan, &lt;i&gt;Picture Perfect&lt;/i&gt; is the true crime chronicle of Jodi Arias. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DEVOTED BACHELOR  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travis Alexander was a handsome, hard-working, practicing Mormon who lived in Mesa, Arizona. His good looks and easygoing manner made him popular with everyone, especially the ladies. So when he was found with a bullet wound in the face and his throat slashed, the brutal murder sent shock waves throughout his community. Who could have done something so sinister?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A DEADLY OBSESSION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But soon a suspect was singled out--Jodi Arias. A beautiful, aspiring photographer, Jodi had been in a long-distance relationship with Travis the year before. But Travis wasn&#39;t interested in a serious commitment; he was seeing several women during that time. When he broke up with her, that didn&#39;t stop Jodi from leaving California, moving to just a few miles away from Travis&#39;s home, and inserting herself into his daily life. Investigators found one piece of startling evidence in Travis&#39;s home that implicated Jodi. But in a bizarre turn of events, Jodi would claim self-defense. Was she a victim--or a devious femme fatale?   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With 8 pages of chilling photos&lt;/p&gt;" />
