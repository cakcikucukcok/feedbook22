  <title>Gold Digger - Constance Rosenblum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sparkling biography of the original blonde whom gentlemen preferred, a woman who made a career of marrying millionaires and became the first tabloid celebrity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of America&#39;s most talked about personalities during the Jazz Age, Peggy Hopkins Joyce was the quintessential gold digger, the real-life Lorelei Lee. Married six times, to several millionaires and even a count, Joyce had no discernible talent except self-promotion. A barber&#39;s daughter from Norfolk, Virginia, who rose to become a Ziegfeld Girl and, briefly, a movie star, Joyce was the precursor of the modern celebrity-a person famous for being famous. Her scandalous exploits-spending a million dollars in a week, conducting torrid love affairs with the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Walter Chrysler-were irresistible to the new breed of tabloid journalists in search of sensation and to audiences hungry for the possibilities her life seemed to promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joyce&#39;s march across Broadway, Hollywood, and the nation&#39;s front pages was only slowed by the true nemesis of the glamour girl: old age. She died in 1957, alone and forgotten-until now. In prose as vibrant as its subject, Constance Rosenblum&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Gold Digger&lt;/i&gt; brings to life the woman who singularly epitomized this confident and hedonistic era.&lt;/p&gt;" />
