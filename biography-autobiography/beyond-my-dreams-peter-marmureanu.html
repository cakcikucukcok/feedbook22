  <title>Beyond My Dreams - Peter Marmureanu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Peter Marmureanu started learning tennis in communist-held Romania, he was ten years old, playing barefoot on clay courts, swinging a wooden paddle that served as a racket. Eight years later, as a member of Romanias Davis Cup team, Marmureanu was traveling side by side with Ilie Nastase and Ion Tiriac to the worlds capitals playing tournaments in Cairo, Monte Carlo, Paris, London, Moscow, and scores of other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Beyond My Dreams&lt;/i&gt;, Marmureanu recounts his life story and how he was forced to become a designated courier for the Securitate, traveling with packets of top-secret documents concealed in his racket cover for delivery to Romanian embassies. In a last-minute flight to freedom that sounds like an espionage thriller, Marmureanu narrates how he made his escape. But even in America, where Donald Rumsfeld and President Gerald Ford helped secure his citizenship, he lived for many years under FBI protection, carrying a handgun for his own safety, knowing the danger that loomed over Romanias defectors and what might happen if he ever went back. And yet, for the sake of his family, Marmureanu risked a returnwitnessing, firsthand, the initial moments of insurrection preceding the fall of an evil regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoirfilled with intrigue, courage, and defianceMarmureanu tells how he escaped one of the most repressive regimes on earththe incredible but true adventure of one mans flight to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
