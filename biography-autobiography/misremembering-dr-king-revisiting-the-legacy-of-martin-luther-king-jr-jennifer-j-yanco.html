  <title>Misremembering Dr. King: Revisiting the Legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. - Jennifer J. Yanco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;We all know the name. Martin Luther King Jr., the great American civil rights leader. But most people today know relatively little about King, the campaigner against militarism, materialism, and racism-what he called the &quot;giant triplets.&quot; Jennifer J. Yanco takes steps to redress this imbalance. &quot;My objective is to highlight the important aspects of Dr. King&#39;s work which have all but disappeared from popular memory, so that more of us can really &#39;see&#39; King.&quot; After briefly telling the familiar story of King&#39;s civil rights campaigns and accomplishments, she considers the lesser-known concerns that are an essential part of his legacy. Yanco reminds us that King was a strong critic of militarism who argued that the United States should take the lead in promoting peaceful solutions rather than imposing its will through military might; that growing materialism and an ethos of greed was damaging the moral and spiritual health of the country; and that in a nation where racism continues unabated, white Americans need to educate themselves about racism and its history and take their part in the weighty task of dismantling it.&lt;/P&gt;" />
