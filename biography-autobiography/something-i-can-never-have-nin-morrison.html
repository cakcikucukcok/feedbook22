  <title>Something I Can Never Have - Nin Morrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sarah is a 24&amp;shy;year&amp;shy;old woman in a relationship with the unstable Louise. Sarah&amp;rsquo;s early childhood is disrupted after her parents&amp;rsquo; divorce and she and her brother and sister remain with their despairing father. Sarah is heartbroken when her father makes a suicide attempt, and she learned to associate love with saving someone&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah brings this belief to her relationship with Lou. At first, it&amp;#39;s a distanced relationship, but after several years, they realise their feelings and Sarah moves to be with her. A love that she thinks is for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah soon realises how insecure and manipulative Lou is, with her addictions and pain, and she begins distancing herself from the relationship to survive. It gives her the space to realize what she needs herself and reflect on what she normally does&amp;hellip;which is too exist for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she meets James, a talented artist. Beautiful, passionate and unstable. Their attraction is immediate and before long, the two are deeply in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the outlook for love be met with success?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story takes place over 18 months, Sarah is more certain about her identity than she ever has been. Yes, she now sees a pattern throughout her life, trying to save others. But now, she has learnt to save herself. &amp;nbsp;While the future may not be so easy to see, but for love, for madness, for self and sanity. She tries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
