  <title>The Long Leg of Italy: Explore with Just Us Two - Rosalie Marsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Long Leg of Italy is the third in the Just Us Two series of travel adventures. It contains a wealth of cultural and historical information which is enriched with twenty photographs and Web links of places explored over the years. A must read for the tourer, dreamer and armchair traveller alike. In The Long Leg of Italy, our intrepid couple set off on their own, Just Us Two, as they began their love affair with Italy. Over the years, exploring Italy by rail, vaporetto in Venice, coach, and other modes of transport, they discovered the diverse life of Italy. Rosie takes you off the usual tourist trail in the cities of Rome, Florence, Venice, and Sorrento, into the Alps and Dolomites where they finally see the Lakes Maggiore, Como, and Lugano while they discovered many smaller, hidden lakes. Travelling into the deep south, they experience the contrast with the north and the rugged, charming beauty of Puglia, the cave dwellings in Basilicata, and the jewel of Calabria - Altomonte - high in the mountains in the foot of Italy. Of course, in true &amp;#39;Just Us Two&amp;#39; style, some disaster or other usually awaits them. Rosalie Marsh titles are available in both print and eBook formats.
