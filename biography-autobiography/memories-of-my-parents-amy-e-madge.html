  <title>Memories of My Parents - Amy E. Madge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, John and Lorraine Madge had ups and downs in life. They loved and respected each other for sixty-three years, motivated by the idea that the hard times only made them stronger. Theirs is a simple yet inspiring story, told here by their sixth child, Amy, who faithfully cared for them in the final years of their lives, ultimately helping them cross over to the other side to meet God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with her parents childhoods, Amy chronicles John and Lorraines journeys through life as they grew up and eventually joined their lives in marriage. As they brought seven children into the world and enjoyed all that life had to offer, the couple also endured struggles, including illness and the loss of a child. While sharing applicable Scripture, Amy details their final years on Earth, not only providing an inspirational glimpse into her role as their caregiver, but also into the loneliness that accompanied her personal journey as she grieved the loss of the most important people in the world to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories of My Parents is a faith-filled story of love shared with the hope that compassionate caregivers will always know they are not on this path alone.&lt;br /&gt;
