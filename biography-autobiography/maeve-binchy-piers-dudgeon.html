  <title>Maeve Binchy - Piers Dudgeon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maeve Binchy&#39;s heartwarming tales of love, life, and loss made her one of America&#39;s best-loved storytellers. Her novels, which sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, captured imaginations on both sides of the Atlantic in a way that most authors only dream of. Seared with a truth and honesty that leapt from the page, her stories capture the imagination and continue to win her legions of loyal fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this extraordinary biography, Piers Dudgeon reveals that the inspiration for many of her stories came from Maeve&#39;s own hard-won experience growing up in Ireland. In the land of her birth and what would become the setting of her novels, Maeve suffered through a difficult adolescence and famously lost her faith before coming to terms with who she was and expressing at last the qualities that would come to define her as both a writer and a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on extensive research and humorous personal anecdotes, &lt;i&gt;Maeve Binchy: The Biography&lt;/i&gt; celebrates the life of a compassionate, down-to-earth and charming woman who touched hearts around the world and left behind an incredible legacy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
