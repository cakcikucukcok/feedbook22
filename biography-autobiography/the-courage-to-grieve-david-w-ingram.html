  <title>The Courage to Grieve - David W. Ingram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author David W. Ingram met his future wife, Kimberly, when she sixteen years old. When he was seventeen, Ingram convinced her to date him. They eventually married and lived a loving life together for thirty years. It all came crashing down when Kimberly was diagnosed with colon cancer and waged a battle against it for four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Courage to Grieve, Ingram narrates his personal story through grief as he learns to live without his beloved wife. It delves into the mind and emotions of a newly grieving spouse and follows him for the first year afterward. This memoir describes an undying love and devotion during four years of suffering, then the aftermath left behind after the death of a beloved spouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Courage to Grieve tells how Ingram drew on his faith in God to choose to survive or give in to his overwhelming sorrow. Written during a years time, it offers a sense of hope and recovery for others facing the grieving process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
