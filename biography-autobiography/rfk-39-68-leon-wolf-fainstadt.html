      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My book will involve my personal experience working with the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Working as part of the advance team that preceded his appearances in Southern California this book will detail my effort to prevent RFKs assasination. My singing group, THE SOUNDS OF TIME, chosen by Mrs. Ethel Kennedy warmed up the crowds and we spent many hours before RFK appeared.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;RFK68 is the title of the book and it will detail what occured both before and after Sen. Kennedys appearance at the Ambassador Hotel. My birthday is on June 5th which is what the book is all about. That day is the day Sen. Kennedy was targeted. This is a never before seen communication and will outline the mistakes made by security guards and even people who staffed the campaign in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
