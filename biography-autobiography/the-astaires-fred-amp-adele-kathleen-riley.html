  <title>The Astaires: Fred &amp;amp; Adele  - Kathleen Riley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Before Fred and Ginger, there was Fred and Adele, a show-business partnership and cultural sensation like no other. In our celebrity-saturated era, its hard to comprehend what a genuine phenomenon these two siblings from Omaha were. At the height of their success in the mid-1920s, the Astaires seemed to define the Jazz Age. They were Gershwins music in motion, a fascinating pair who wove spellbinding rhythms in song and dance.    In this book, the first comprehensive study of their theatrical career together, Kathleen Riley traces the Astaires rise to fame from humble midwestern origins and early days as child performers on small-time vaudeville stages (where Fred, fatefully, first donned top hat and tails) to their 1917 debut on Broadway to star billings on both sides of the Atlantic. They became ambassadors of an art form they helped to revolutionize, adored by audiences, feted by royalty, and courted socially by elites everywhere they went. From the start, Adele was the more natural performer, spontaneous, funny, and self-possessed, while Fred had to hone his trademark timing and elegance through endless hours of rehearsal, a disciplined regimen that Adele loathed. Ultimately, Freds dancing expertise surpassed his sisters, and their paths diverged: Adele married into British aristocracy, and Fred headed for Hollywood.   The Astaires examines in depth the extraordinary story of this great brother-sister team, with full attention to its historical and theatrical context. It is not merely an account of the first part of Freds long and illustrious career but one with its own significance. Born at the close of the 1800s, Fred and Adele grew up together with the new century, and when they reached superstardom during the interwar years, they shone as an affirmation of life and hope amid a prevailing crisis of faith and identity." />
