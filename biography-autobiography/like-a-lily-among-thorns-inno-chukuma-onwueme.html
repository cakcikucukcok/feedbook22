  <title>Like a Lily Among Thorns - Inno Chukuma Onwueme</title>
      <meta name="description" content="* Awarded RECOMMENDED status by US Review of Books
* Awarded FIVE STARS by Readers Favorite Reviews 
Imagine yourself having one foot planted on one continent while the other foot is on another continent. A huge transformational step, isnt it? Thats precisely what Inno Onwuemes early-life story does. One foot is planted firmly in the traditional African village where age-old customs mingle with poverty, disease, ignorance, and deprivation. The other foot pivots tantalizingly in 1960s California, at the cutting edge of western civilization. Here, searing social and political upheavals of global significance were shaking the very foundations of modern America and the world. Add to the mix, a second dimension where your journey starts with a decade of colonial rule, and extends through the first decade of post-colonial independence, straddling both eras. And did we mention a civil war, and his becoming a refugee? It was a time of great fomentation personally, nationally and globally.
Read this engaging story and enjoy it as a thrilling novel, richly spiced with African proverbs. Then pinch yourself and recall that this is not fiction. It all truly happened. This was a real life being lived in exciting times. Challenge yourself to explore how the changes of the political transition intertwined with Professor Innos transformation from an African village boy to a cosmopolitan man in America. Marvel at how the history of an era was acted out in microcosm by this village boy. LIKE A LILY AMONG THORNS takes global and national metamorphosis down to the personal level. It invites you to see history in a new light." />
