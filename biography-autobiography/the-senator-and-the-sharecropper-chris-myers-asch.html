  <title>The Senator and the Sharecropper - Chris Myers Asch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this fascinating study of race, politics, and economics in Mississippi, Chris Myers Asch tells the story of two extraordinary personalities--Fannie Lou Hamer and James O. Eastland--who represented deeply opposed sides of the civil rights movement. Both were from Sunflower County: Eastland was a wealthy white planter and one of the most powerful segregationists in the U.S. Senate, while Hamer, a sharecropper who grew up desperately poor just a few miles from the Eastland plantation, rose to become the spiritual leader of the Mississippi freedom struggle. Asch uses Hamer&#39;s and Eastland&#39;s entwined histories, set against the backdrop of Sunflower County&#39;s rise and fall as a center of cotton agriculture, to explore the county&#39;s changing social landscape during the mid-twentieth century and its persistence today as a land separate and unequal. Asch, who spent nearly a decade in Mississippi as an educator, offers a fresh look at the South&#39;s troubled ties to the cotton industry, the long struggle for civil rights, and unrelenting social and economic injustice through the eyes of two of the era&#39;s most important and intriguing figures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
