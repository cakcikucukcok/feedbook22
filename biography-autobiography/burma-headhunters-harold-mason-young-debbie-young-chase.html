  <title>Burma Headhunters - Harold Mason Young, Debbie Young Chase</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an old writing about the Wa tribal people. During the period of this report written by Harold Mason Young, he was associated less frequently and gained knowledge of their ways from direct contact as well as from the Lahu people. His perspective of the Wa tribal people is unique, especially as it was in the early part of 1900 when the Wa were still practicing their traditional way. It offers some interesting information on the Wa, of which few foreigners ever saw during this period of history. There are likely studiers of ethnic tribal people that will find some of the book useful and maybe even entertaining." />
