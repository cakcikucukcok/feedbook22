  <title>Switzerland on All Fours - Lloyd Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; The Swiss Alpine Pass Route is varied long distance walk in Switzerland.  Crossing 16 passes in 15 stages, the walker will ascend around 58,000ft and will pass many famous peaks such as the Eiger, Monch and Jungrau, Todi and Titlis and the Wetterhorn.  A challenging route for most humans but even more so for a ten year old one-eyed Smooth Fox Terrier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cows with ringing bells, dark timber chalets, brightly coloured flowers, cascading waterfalls and quaint remote villages are encountered as one crosses Switzerland from East to West.  The remoteness of Richetli contrasts sharply with the hustle and bustle of Montreux yet all areas are undoubtedly Swiss in character and each town, village, pass and remote Alp brings its own charms and unique flavour to this inspiring route.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A veteran of long distance routes across the UK and Europe; the West Highland Way, Great Glen Way, Raad ny Foillan and Tour du Mont Blanc, Harry was no spring chicken.  However, ten years of going up mountains, across bogs and moors, swimming rivers and crossing forests had prepared Harry well.  More at home in a tent than a house, this is one intelligent and tenacious Smooth Fox Terrier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book recounts Harrys side of the story; his thoughts and experiences has he completed his epic 250 mile walkies over the top of the Alps from Sargans to Montreux.
