  <title>A Road Without a Map - Rose Aimée</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rose Aime&lt;/b&gt; was born in the winter of 1938 in a remote village in the province of Quebec. Eager to learn, she began attending a one-room school in 1945 at the age of seven. Unfortunately, she had to quit school after fourth grade so that she could care for her sick mother and four younger siblings. It was a time of great struggle, but it was just the beginning of her journey. Spanning seven decades, &lt;i&gt;A Road without a Map&lt;/i&gt; recounts Roses life as she developed from a shy girl to a successful business woman, wife, and mother. Ambitious and energetic, Rose began her first job as a housekeeper at the age of fifteen and from there took on a string of jobs in her quest to better herself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The years brought more challenges. Rose was forced to give up her infant daughter, and she and her husband, Henry, faced prejudice because of his Chinese descent. But Rose kept persevering. She and Henry had a daughter, bought their own restaurant, and even traveled to China. Though there were tough times ahead, Rose had truly found a new life, one far removed from the rural Quebec cabin of her birth.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Clearly detailed, &lt;i&gt;A Road without a Map&lt;/i&gt; reveals one womans remarkable strength and spirit through the diverse events of her life." />
