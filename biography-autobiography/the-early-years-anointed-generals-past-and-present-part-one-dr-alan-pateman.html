  <title>The Early Years, Anointed Generals Past and Present (Part One) - Dr. Alan Pateman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s true to say, there has been a lot of material printed on the subject of God&#39;s Generals. Perhaps there has even been an awakening to the true meaning of Ministry Outreach, Evangelisation, etc. With Bible Schools being established around the world at an enormous pace, as revival is on the lips and in the hearts of many a committed man and woman in the body of Christ. I pray that the divine anointing that is and has been upon these Anointed Generals Past and Present will be afforded to flow upon our heads, that those who are reported to be the generals of today would be strong enough - humble enough - to give time to those who desire to learn and grow and be established. So that what God has given to them will be our inheritance for the future. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." />
