  <title>Drama of My Life – Through Youth and War - Lawrence Ahuruonye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story in this book is an account of my life encounters. It is a story of an individual, myself, who was born into a polygamous family and had to struggle to overcome life obstacles and human hardship. In 1947, when I was born, basic public amenities were lacking in my village. I drank my first near-clean water at the age of seven. 
Illnesses were treated with herbs and plant roots, which medicine men and herbalists provided. Beliefs in ancestral spirits and the worship of deities controlled lives. The vanity of those beliefs came to light as I got older and I debunked them all.
The greatest challenge my life faced was the Biafra/Nigeria war, which tested human desire to survive, especially, for those from Eastern Nigeria at the time. The atrocities of that war and human suffering they generated, are testimonies to how the human spirit could absorb the most penetrating shocks. That tough human spirit found ways to preserve me, as well as chart a course for the realization of my life dream. That dream turned out to be the American dream, which I believe I have achieved. Thanks to some unseen hands that made everything possible." />
