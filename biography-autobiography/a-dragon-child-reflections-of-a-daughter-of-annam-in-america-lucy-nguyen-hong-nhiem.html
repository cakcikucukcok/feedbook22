  <title>A Dragon Child: Reflections of a Daughter of Annam in America - Lucy Nguyen-Hong-Nhiem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;A Dragon Child: Reflections of a Daughter of Annam in America&lt;/I&gt; is the story of a Vietnamese Catholic raised within the structure of the French colonial system. Her upbringing was somewhat privileged as the daughter of a provincial administrator in the central highlands of Vietnam. As a child, and later as a young woman, she embraced French culture and aspired to French ideals. She was educated at a French boarding school for the children of the elite. Subsequently she received a degree in French teaching from the University of Saigon and became a lycee teacher and administrator.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In 1975, she left on one of the last military planes accompanied by her four children and entered a new life as a refugee in the U.S. She ultimately resettled in Western Massachusetts. She then went back to school and obtained her Ph.D. in Francophone literature. After seeing to her children&#39;s education she began her academic career and started to teach French in the Five College academic community. She has fulfilled the &quot;American dream&quot; as have her children. In the process she has rediscovered her cultural roots and has helped others to negotiate the same path.&lt;/P&gt;" />
