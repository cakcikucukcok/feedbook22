  <title>Descent: My Epic Fall from Cycling Superstardom to Doping Dead End - Thomas Dekker, Thomas Dekker, Thijs Zonneveld, Thijs Zonneveld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Award-Winning, International Best-Seller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I have success, money, women. I&#39;ve been lionized by the public and the press. The world is at my feet. I&#39;ve spread my wings and here I am, soaring above everything and everyone. But in reality, the descent has already begun.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 20, Thomas Dekker was already earning €100,000 a year-as an &lt;i&gt;amateur&lt;/i&gt; bike racer. The next year, he turned pro and his salary quadrupled then rose again to €900,000 as he established his position as a super-domestique among Europe&#39;s wealthiest superteams. The sport marveled at Dekker&#39;s rise as the young racer set his ambitions on capturing cycling&#39;s biggest prizes for himself. Before long, though, Dekker found himself corrupted by money, dazzled by fame, and cracking under the relentless pressure to perform at a superhuman level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his tell-all book &lt;i&gt;DESCENT: My Epic Fall from Cycling Superstardom to Doping Dead End&lt;/i&gt;, Dekker reveals a sordid way of life full of blood bags, drugs, prostitutes, and money. &lt;i&gt;DESCENT&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a yearslong bender that exposes the brutal truth of his life as a professional cyclist. And Dekker is not alone; he names those who fell with him and those who aided in his downfall. In &lt;i&gt;DESCENT&lt;/i&gt;, we take an unflinching look at the European peloton as it roars through its modern boom years-the height of the EPO era-and what we see is shocking. You won&#39;t be able to turn away from this page-turning read about one man&#39;s rise, fall, and redemption and what his story reveals about professional sports. &lt;/p&gt;" />
