  <title>Once More from the Beginning - Donald G. Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are a great chain! Each of us is forged into shape by the things we do in life. Yet, we remain, connected to the previous link. We arrive, as a spot of hot molten metal, pliable and ready to be crafted, as if by the blacksmiths of old. Following the time of childhood we gain mastery over our life working so feverishly to form it and shape it, an exciting new link! Albeit, we are inextricably tied to the previous link who has by now, become solid and hard with age. As time passes, each of us will issue new links, our children. Later, we too, will, in time, become hardened and set in our ways as we slowly slip into the pages of history with our ancestors. 
Interestingly, this is a chain that cannot be broken; but it will be tried, twisted and stretched during our times of trouble. A link can be weak or strong. We will manifest both our strengths and our weakness to all who follow us. Our responsibility is to bring something good to the chain and not to shame, defile or weaken it!" />
