  <title>The Lives They Left Behind - Peter Stastny, Darby Penney, Robert Whitaker, Lisa Rinzler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;&lt;I&gt;The Lives They Left Behind&lt;/I&gt; is a deeply moving testament to the human side of mental illness, and of the narrow margin which so often separates the sane from the mad. It is a remarkable portrait, too, of the life of a psychiatric asylum&amp;#151;the sort of community in which, for better and for worse, hundreds of thousands of people lived out their lives. Darby Penney and Peter Stastny&amp;#8217;s careful historical (almost archaeological) and biographical reconstructions give us unique insight into these lives which would otherwise be lost and, indeed, unimaginable to the rest of us.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Oliver Sacks&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Fascinating. . . . The haunting thing about the suitcase owners is that it&amp;#8217;s so easy to identify with them.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Newsweek&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Willard State Hospital closed its doors in 1995, after operating as one of New York State&amp;#8217;s largest mental institutions for over 120 years, a forgotten attic filled with suitcases belonging to former patients was discovered. Using the possessions found in these suitcases along with institutional records and doctors&amp;#8217; notes from patient sessions, Darby Penney, a leading advocate of patients&amp;#8217; rights, and Peter Stastny, a psychiatrist and documentary filmmaker, were able to reconstruct the lives of ten patients who resided at Willard during the first half of the twentieth century. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Lives They Left Behind&lt;/I&gt; tells their story. In addition to these human portraits, the book contains over 100 photographs as well as valuable historical background on how this state-funded institution operated. As it restores the humanity of the individuals it so poignantly evokes, &lt;I&gt;The Lives They Left Behind&lt;/I&gt; reveals the vast historical inadequacies of a psychiatric system that has yet to heal itself.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
