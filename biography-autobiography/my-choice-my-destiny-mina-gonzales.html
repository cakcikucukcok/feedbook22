  <title>My Choice, My Destiny - Mina Gonzales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Kidney failure, dialysis, and transplantation are three words that most people hope never to hear in their lifetimes. Mina Gonzales wasnt so lucky. In her memoir, she shares the story of her experiences, a story about choices, destiny, and the ultimate sacrifice that gives life. She knows the pitfalls and setbacks one faces when dealing with the realities of dialysis, organ donation, and kidney transplantation. She recalls those here, along with her journey of personal discovery, family strength, and community involvement. She faced trials and tribulations during dialysis but ultimately emerged victorious, having survived a kidney transplant for more than fifteen years.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Her story could be anyones story. Along with her experiences, she focuses on facing the truth about life and recognizing the gift that it is. For anyone facing kidney failure, Gonzales provides the information that you need to know. She addresses not only broad questions of life through the lens of her personal experiences, but also specific questions relating to living with kidney failure: What is dialysis? What types are there? How long is a session?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My Choice My Destiny: My Kidney Transplant Journey is intended to be used as a daily spiritual guide to help get through the long hours of dialysis. It is an honest expression of hope that you too will find your donor angel and live a long and healthy life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
