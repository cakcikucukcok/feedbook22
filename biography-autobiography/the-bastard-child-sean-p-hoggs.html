  <title>The Bastard Child - Sean P. Hoggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bastard Child is the long awaited autobiography by author Sean P. Hoggs. His gripping true-life story takes the reader from his abusive and turbulent childhood, through his struggles as a homeless teenager (in the violent inner city streets of Central New Jersey), to his incredible rise onto the national and international stage as an humanitarian and mentor. Each chapter is a remarkable, yet humble, testament to resiliency and perseverance. 
Regardless of age, race, socioeconomic background, start or station in life, his tragedy to triumph story is one for the ages. The Bastard Child is an uplifting American success story that goes far beyond your stereotypical rags to riches story shared today. If you ever hungered for an inspirational life story to help you overcome personal hardship or a challenge in life, this book is simply a must read. 
The Bastard Child...To say that this book will change many lives is an understatement. I am forever changed since reading it. A book like this comes along once in a generation! 
-Dione Lauray-Davis (Community Activist) 
The Bastard ChildOnce I picked the book up, I could not put it down. This  autobiography is a must read, it&#39;s inspiring me to continue my education. I highly recommend this book for anyone who&#39;s having any kind of doubts about achieving their goals in life.
