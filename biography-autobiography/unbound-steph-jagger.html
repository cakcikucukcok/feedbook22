  <title>Unbound - Steph Jagger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A young woman follows winter across five continents on a physical and spiritual journey that tests her body and soul, in this transformative memoir, full of heart and courage, that speaks to the adventurousness in all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steph Jagger had always been a force of nature. Dissatisfied with the passive, limited roles she saw for women growing up, she emulated the men in her life&amp;#8212;chasing success, climbing the corporate ladder, ticking the boxes, playing by the rules of a masculine ideal. She was accomplished. She was living &quot;The Dream.&quot; But it wasn&#39;t her dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the universe caught her attention with a sign: &lt;em&gt;Raise Restraining Device.&lt;/em&gt; Steph had seen this ski lift sign on countless occasions in the past, but the familiar words suddenly became a personal call to shake off the life she had built in a search for something different, something more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steph soon decided to walk away from the success and security she had worked long and hard to obtain. She quit her job, took a second mortgage on her house, sold everything except her ski equipment and her laptop, and bought a bundle of plane tickets. For the next year, she followed winter across North and South America, Asia, Europe, and New Zealand&amp;#8212;and up and down the mountains of nine countries&amp;#8212;on a mission to ski four million vertical feet in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What hiking was for Cheryl Strayed, skiing became for Steph: a crucible in which to crack open her life and get to the very center of herself. But she would have to break herself down&amp;#8212;first physically, then emotionally&amp;#8212;before she could start to rebuild. And it was through this journey that she came to understand how to be a woman, how to love, and how to live authentically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrifying, heartfelt, and full of humor, &lt;em&gt;Unbound &lt;/em&gt;is Steph&amp;#8217;s story&amp;#8212;an odyssey of courage and self-discovery that, like &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eat, Pray, Love,&lt;/em&gt; will inspire readers to remove their own restraining devices and pursue the life they are meant to lead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
