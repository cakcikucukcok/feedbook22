  <title>No Fourth River. A Novel Based on a True Story. A profoundly moving read about a woman&#39;s fight for survival. - Christine Clayfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Electroshock therapy, child abuse and modern-day slavery&amp;hellip; just another day in Christine&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a heart-wrenching yet inspiring ride through one woman&amp;rsquo;s incredible journey that is so compelling that you are simultaneously trying to look away and unable to stop yourself from reading on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christine&amp;rsquo;s father is a wealthy, tyrannical man renowned in the diamond business. At the age of just five, little Christine is cast aside into a boarding school where she is ridiculed for two embarrassing problems. She grows up in a never-ending circle of traumatic experiences both in her boarding school and at home. It culminates into a falling out between father and child that was never fully mended, leading her into a world of promiscuity and alcohol, eventually landing her in a violent marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driven to the limits of despair and heartache, she creates a plan to escape her world of misery. Will her plan work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story that asks: &lt;em&gt;How do you find the strength, when you suffer almost unbearable abuse and are broken beyond repair, to pick up the pieces of a shattered life?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REVIEWS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly&amp;hellip;.I was really quite impressed. You have a from-the-heart tale that resonates. This novel is very well written, a real page turner. It&amp;rsquo;s inspirational and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. &lt;em&gt;Amanda Rogers, Proofreader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is powerful stuff. I like your frank, no excuses yet no shame writing style. It&amp;#39;s rare to find a script that actually has me thinking about it later. A story that strikes at a visceral level and latches onto the brain like a tick... now that&amp;#39;s good writing. &lt;em&gt;Richard Peters, Editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. Gosh what a life! I am never saying again that I am struggling after reading this book! I love Christine&amp;rsquo;s writing style.&lt;em&gt;Tina Cowley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought the price was a bit steep but now that I&amp;rsquo;ve read this superb book, it was well worth the price. Ridiculously good book!&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Donald Cruize&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epic of a novel is an understatement for this book. The writing style is outstanding. This is an inspirational story. Got me thinking about my own life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Garry Newington&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the novels I read are fancy-pancy-style-writing. Not this one. It is clearly written from the heart and that shines through the book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Emily Verdeen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great story, very inspirational! I found it hard to put down this book. Absolutely loved it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Linzy Apppledore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incredibly well written. Great book by a great author.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Tim Dunbarn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is beyond belief. Powerful, enlightening and inspiring. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame I can&amp;rsquo;t give it 10 stars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Anthony Dabston&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve read many personal histories in my life. Mostly about valiant women who have survived horrors that you only see in Hollywood movies. But, this is not horror, this is real. An unloved young girl loses everything and has to overcome the worst that life can throw to have the very best in life in the end. From Hell to Heaven, No Fourth River offers you the keys to Christine&amp;rsquo;s success. HINT: No luck involved. I could taste the blood .... it was that real..&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Jay C. Polmar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loved this book. A real page turner and so much life in 300 pages! The novel is fast paced and the author caries you with her as she takes you on her life&amp;rsquo;s journey and events unfold. A gripping, yet inspirational story of love and conquering adversity and one woman&amp;rsquo;s struggle through childhood, adolescence and womanhood. A &amp;ldquo;must&amp;rdquo; read for anyone whose lost direction or having difficulty in life and needs a positive influence and some encouraging words.&lt;em&gt;Sheena Newton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
