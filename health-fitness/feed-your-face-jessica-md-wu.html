  <title>Feed Your Face - Jessica Md Wu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tired of wasting hundreds of dollars on expensive wrinkle creams, drying lotions, and zit-zappers that just don&#39;t work? Well listen up, ladies. To really get gorgeous, you&#39;ve got to change the way you feed your face. &lt;br&gt;Cosmetics companies, women&#39;s magazines--heck, even most doctors--will swear that food doesn&#39;t affect the skin. But celebrity dermatologist Dr. Jessica Wu knows that&#39;s just not true. After years spent battling her own pimple-prone, &quot;problem&quot; skin (not to mention caring for some of Hollywood&#39;s most famous faces), she&#39;s learned that what you eat has&lt;i&gt; everything&lt;/i&gt; to do with the condition of your complexion. &lt;br&gt;Packed with patient testimonials and celebrity anecdotes from stars like Katherine Heigl, Maria Bello, Kimora Lee Simmons, and Lisa Ling, FEED YOUR FACE is an easy-to-follow, 28-day diet plan that will help you banish blemishes, wipe out wrinkles, shed unwanted pounds, and generally feel better--in your clothes and in your skin. Along the way, Dr. Wu will dish the dirt on her journey from Harvard Medical School to the glamorous Hollywood Hills, while offering realistic, practical beauty and diet advice for women of all ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to soften your crow&#39;s-feet? Find out which foods will turn back time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plagued by pimples? Discover the snacks that will erase stubborn blemishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know milk doesn&#39;t always do a body good? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel a sunburn coming on? Learn why red wine may save your skin from peeling and flaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does a hard-partying rock star eat for good skin? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So stop thinking about food in terms of what you &lt;i&gt;can&#39;t &lt;/i&gt;have: no butter, no red meat, no fat, and no flavor. Instead, discover the foods that will keep you feeling full and looking gorgeous. Follow the FEED YOUR FACE Diet, and you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; have pizza. You can go out for Italian, indulge in Chinese takeout, and dine at The Cheesecake Factory (with the help of the FEED YOUR FACE Restaurant Guide). Because you do have the power to change your skin. All you have to do is eat.&lt;/p&gt;" />
