  <title>Finding Happiness - Dr Kenny Akindele-Akande</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You may have been surviving all these time. It is high time you started living-not just living but enjoys life. It is about time that the new version of you emerges. Happiness comes from knowing that your life is not stagnant and that, at each phase of life, you are evolving into something new and fresh, which brings joy and zest to your life. True happiness comes from the realization of the joy within, rooted in discovering and knowing who we are. What we possess or long to be doesnt define us. Our true identity lies deep within us.
Many people struggle with unhappiness, identity crises, hurt and pain and yet they still have to continue to live, expecting to be perfect in their relationships, to fulfill obligations at work, and so on. No one cares to be patient enough to see through the outer covering and reach out to help them. We cant really blame anyone. Everyone has got their cross to carry. That is one of the reasons I wrote this bookto do it yourself and to help yourself find the happiness you deserve.
Do you have a longinga search for identityand a yearning to discover who you really want to be? That is another reason I wrote this book. Trust me, I have been there. I am not just giving theory. I am introducing you to the practicality of my journey to happiness.
Are you ready to love yourself enough to take actions required for your happiness? Reading this book is one of the best decisions you made this year." />
