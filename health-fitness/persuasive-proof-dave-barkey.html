  <title>Persuasive Proof - Dave Barkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Readers of Persistent Pursuit will pick up the story of Brad and Stella Crosley after they settled into their north central Iowa wooded hideaway they call Haven Acres. Their tranquility is disrupted by the nocturnal arrival of an uninvited guest. Will their marriage survive the threat of a triangular relationship as they tackle the multiple issues of another inhabitant of Haven Acres? Will their newfound faith in Christ withstand the challenges they will face? Will Stella, who previously abandoned her husband and infant son, assume the role of faithful wife and devoted mother? Find out if the Crosleys manage to achieve persuasive proof.
I was delighted to find that Haven Acres was still very much alive in Persuasive Proof, the sequel to Dave Barkeys first novel Persistent Pursuit. The familiar and memorable personalities continue their adventures. Brad Crosley, principal of the local elementary school, and his wife Stella are in the process of making a comfortable Christian home for their son Gerald. The author beautifully and sensitively draws the reader into Brads struggles to balance his responsibilities among  nurturing his family, running the elementary school, participating in church activities, and cultivating relationships in  the community. The story intensifies as Brad and Stella reach out to a desperate Sally, offering shelter and hope. This new-found hope is threatened by unforeseen  challenges only to realize later that God had a better plan. Thank you, Dave Barkey, for another inspiring book and Im already anticipating the next.
