  <title>Cancer Is Just Right for God - Ester S. Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a person is given the diagnose of Cancer, the first thing that comes to mind is death. Sometime it is death that come to pass.  It is the location of the Cancer, and the stage of the Cancer.  Early detection makes the
difference in some cases, and some location there is no hope. But with the knowledge of Cancer in your body, this gives you the chance to get your soul right with God. You can not die but once.  We are all born to die that is Gods promise and his plan for our life.
	My book gives you my experience on how to live, how to believe in Gods word, how to give God the praise, and keep the faith.  When you have read that Cancer Is Just Right For God, you will be able to live a blessed life with what ever challenge that affect your life. Just put your challenge where I have the word Cancer, because all things are Just Right For God.  
	By my sharing with you about my challenges with Breast Cancer. I hope and pray that when you read the book that I will  have walked you through the circumstances of finding out that you have Cancer.  And helped with the experiences that most people have to endure. Be hopeful, believe, and fight.
	May you be blessed by reading the book.  Each book sold one dollar will go to the Cancer Society, St. Judes Research for Cancer, and The United Way." />
