  <title>Dying to Win - Teri Capshaw, Sam Sorbo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is fear of failing your child academically holding your family hostage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you grasping for ways to ensure your children will learn what they need to compete in a global economy? Is homework dominating your household? Are you worried the education you provide for your children won&amp;rsquo;t be good enough?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Teri Capshaw understands the burdens parents carry all too well. The truth is even in some parts of the world where students ace international tests families still struggle. Dying to Win exposes the dark side of a culture where &amp;ldquo;cramming&amp;rdquo; is taken to a new extreme, academic pressure kills the love of learning, and some students are pushed to the brink of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s clear &amp;ldquo;more of the same&amp;rdquo; won&amp;rsquo;t help, Teri shares a radically different approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Through interviews and insights she reveals what makes kids from successful homeschool families excel. Discover the seven steps you can take to inspire and ignite a love of learning in your children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teri Capshaw is a homeschooling mother on a mission to help families overcome limitations imposed by an overstressed world. She knows what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be held back by fear&amp;mdash; and the incredible opportunities available to families courageous enough to live life differently. You can connect with Teri, and get a free guide to selecting educational resources, at TeriCapshaw.com. She also helps families craft their ideal lifestyle at HomesteadLarder.com.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they&amp;rsquo;re not living abroad Teri and her husband, Jesse, call rural Idaho home.
