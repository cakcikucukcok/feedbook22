  <title>Chicken Soup for Your Future - Phil Sumner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How would you like to add an extra 10 years to your life??? An enjoyable 10 years? It is now possible with health approaches I use. And if 10 years is acceptable to you, how about 15 years? 20 years? Still more?
Please note that I said AN ENJOYABLE 10 YEARS. I believe that we can all agree that life without some form of enjoyment is not worth living. After all, I want to enjoy the presence of other people, especially my grandkids and great grandkids. Their occasional presence is an absolute delight. 
I am personally looking forward to my next 20 years. And at the end of that 20 years, I now plan to enjoy another 20 years. Would you like to join me? I am personally looking forward to what the future will bring. And I very much wish that you would also look forward to the future as I do.
Please note that this report is guaranteed to change your way of life, for the better. Just imagine: a life with no worries about catching an ordinary disease like a cold or the flu (I habitually pass up the opportunity for a flu shot each Fall); a life of better and better health and better and better enjoyment; and, through contact with me, access to other ideas that can contribute to your future satisfaction and well-being. I now have several topics in expanded form that I plan to send to all my honored subscribers. 
Is the prospect of enjoyably living many more years very exciting to you? Then my report titled Future Health should be just the ticket you need. So send a check for $35 to Phil Sumner, 10 Ruth Drive, Gordonville PA 17529. My report will be sent to you as soon as possible. Send for your copy of my report today; your life of better and more enjoyable health awaits you.
Your satisfaction is guaranteed; if you are not satisfied with the report, you can send it back undamaged and I will gladly refund your money." />
