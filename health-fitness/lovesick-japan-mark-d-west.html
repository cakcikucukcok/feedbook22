  <title>Lovesick Japan - Mark D. West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Lovesick Japan&lt;/em&gt;, Mark D. West explores an official vision of love, sex, and marriage in contemporary Japan. A comprehensive body of evidence-2,700 court opinions-describes a society characterized by a presupposed absence of physical and emotional intimacy, affection, and personal connections. In compelling, poignant, and sometimes horrifying court cases, West finds that Japanese judges frequently opine on whether a person is in love, what other emotions a person is feeling, and whether those emotions are appropriate for the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sometimes judges&#39; views about love, sex, and marriage emerge from their presentation of the facts of cases. Among the recurring elements are abortions forced by men, compensated dating, late-life divorces, termination fees to end affairs, sexless couples, Valentine&#39;s Day heartbreak, &quot;soapland&quot; bath-brothels, and home-wrecking hostesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sometimes the judges&#39; analysis, decisions, and commentary are as revealing as the facts. Sex in the cases is a choice among private &quot;normal&quot; sex, which is male-dominated, conservative, dispassionate, or nonexistent; commercial sex, which caters to every fetish but is said to lead to rape, murder, and general social depravity; and a hybrid of the two, which commodifies private sexual relationships. Marriage is contractual; judges express the ideal of love in marriage and proclaim its importance, but virtually no one in the court cases achieves it. Love usually appears as a tragic, overwhelming emotion associated with jealousy, suffering, heartache, and death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
