  <title>Health Care Observations - Belen F. Cantiller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a health-care professional, a licensed registered nurse, I have gained and
benefited from the many and various experiences I had in the health-care industry.
In this time of advancing technology of Facebook, Twitter, cell phones,
computers, internet, website, satellite, information about any and everything
abounds and surrounds us. Yet even if there is much that is known, the unknown
seems infinite. What secret has everlasting life?
This book provides a slight insight of some of my medical experiences. Almost
everyone is seriously concerned about having good health. I hope some of the
observations, awareness from my listening, and some prudent advice I have gained
maybe informative, interesting, and beneficial to you as readers of this book.
This is an insight of some of my experiences. It is a significant amount of
involved observing and listening. As with all health-care situations, I have spent
a great deal of time analyzing my own participation to determine how to improve
the delivery and execution of my service.
While I am enormously proud of what I have accomplished, and Im pleased
of some of my practices and lessons learned. I know there is still more work to be
done; I also recognize that I am not alone in this endeavor. With the help of others,
we will close the gap of the healthcare divide.
This book details some of the inter reactions and relations among patients,
family, healthcare professionals, workers, and others in a healthcare environment.
It may be an antidote to the plague of chatter in this time of endless information." />
