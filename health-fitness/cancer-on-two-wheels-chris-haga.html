  <title>Cancer on Two Wheels - Chris Haga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;“Cancer isn’t just a physical battle, it’s a mental and spiritual battle as well.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Chris Haga wrote those words at age fifty after being diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer that had metastasized to his brain. He had never smoked. He was riding his bike eighty miles a week when diagnosed, and he continued to enjoy riding for four more years despite cancer and only having one good lung. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Cancer on Two Wheels&lt;/i&gt;, Chris candidly shares intimate details of his spiritual battles with hope and faith that God would heal him. He shares how he turned a terminal diagnosis into a positive outlook on life. Through cherished personal memories, he lets you into his family life and inspires you to reflect on who and what is important in life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Chris’s insights will encourage you to examine your own faith during difficult times. His battle will assure you that it is normal to have doubts and question God’s motives; God expects it. His story demonstrates how one man grew his faith against all odds and how you, too, can grow your faith when life turns against you.&lt;br&gt;" />
