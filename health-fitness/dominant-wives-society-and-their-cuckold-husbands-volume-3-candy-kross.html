  <title>Dominant Wives Society and Their Cuckold Husbands Volume 3 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="His wife wasn&#39;t the only thing he didn&#39;t see. His clothes were missing too! Roy panicked. Liz must have taken his clothes by accident! Roy felt his stomach start to churn and he became very nervous. She&#39;ll be back, he thought. She has to be back!    After about what seemed like an eternity, but was about an hour, had passed. She&#39;s not coming back. Roy finally came to the conclusion. How could she? How could she do this to him?    Since it was Saturday, the boutique closed early. He heard the sales girls giggling and saying goodbye to Shawn, the male sales clerk. Roy then realized it was only he and Shawn in the store now. Roy opened the door slowly. Shawn was standing outside the door.    &quot;I was wondering how long it would be until you decided to come out of there.&quot; Shawn teased. &quot;Honey, I&#39;ve seen guys come out of the closet faster than you coming out of that dressing room.&quot; Shawn smiled.    &quot;You knew I was in there?&quot; Roy asked.    &quot;Of course I did.&quot; He winked. &quot;Your wife Liz and I are old friends." />
