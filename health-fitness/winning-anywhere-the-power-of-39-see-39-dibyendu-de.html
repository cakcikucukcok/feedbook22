  <title>Winning Anywhere - the Power of &#39;See&#39; - Dibyendu De</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How much do you want to be a winner? How much do you yearn to resolve nagging problems in your work and life?  How do we transform failures into successes? What made, Einstein win? How Tagore focused his consciousness to be one of the great poets? How did Gandhi see through problems? How did winners like Guru Nanak, Shri Ramakrishna and Gautama Buddha create great movements around their schools of thought? Both organizations and individuals can learn and gain from those insights. 
This book which forms the first part of the N-E-M-E series, basically concentrates on the Sa note of the Sargam or the Do of the octave, the starting point of all that is harmonious and melodious. Dibyendu in this wonderful narration humbly asks people to see and become a winner in whatever they do.  
The secret lies in mastering the mind and directing it to unravel the mysteries of complex reality that constantly engulfs our lives in multiple layers. In a way, it tries to guide the reader to break free of seemingly impossible strangleholds in life and work through the power of SEE. 
This book seeks to answer a universal question. 
How does one enhance ones quality of life and work to live more humanely and harmoniously? 
 1 of the best of @PredictSwan Imagination and memory have their proper place but if used wrongly they transform into slippery paths to hell -- @humanatom 
&quot;Once there is self-awareness, traders can practice improving strengths and reducing weaknesses. @predictswan -- @toughloveforx" />
