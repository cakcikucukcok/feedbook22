  <title>That Was When People Started to Worry - Nancy Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="‘In the waiting room, I see a lot of people who I could tell had real, serious Problems. They deserve to be here. I don’t. I’m a fraud. A lazy wreck seeking an excuse for her incompetence. I’m useless.’ Abby, 24
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Having conducted over 100 hours of interviews with 60 British women aged 16–25, Nancy Tucker – the author of &lt;i&gt;The Time In Between,&lt;/i&gt; an ‘astonishingly good’ (&lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt;) memoir of a life consumed by eating disorders – explores what it’s like to suffer from serious mental illness as a young woman. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
With raw honesty, sensitivity and humour, &lt;i&gt;That Was When People Started to Worry&lt;/i&gt; examines real experiences of anxiety, self-harm, borderline personality disorder, OCD, binge eating disorder, PTSD and dissociative identity disorder.
Giving a voice to those like Abby who can’t speak out themselves, Tucker presents a unique window into the day-to-day trials of living with an unwell mind." />
