  <title>How to Stop Giving Your Power Away - Kurt Winowich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are an average American, you have been giving your power away without even knowing it. We have been taught that it is not good to seek power or to be powerful. Thoughts of greed, money, manipulation, controlling of others or even military force comes to mind. We have been taught this lie and thus we have become disempowered without even realizing it. The result of this manipulation can show up in our lives as depression, illness, stress, anxiety, or a general loss of happiness. 
What is true power and why is it important to us as individuals? Simply, your power is measured by your ability to create the things that you want to see in your life. Anything that disrupts this natural ability, we call disempowering. Anything that enhances this natural ability, we call that empowering. People are unknowingly giving away their power by the things that they watch, listen to, think, say and do daily. By retaining your innate power, you will improve all the areas of your life, including your health, your relationships and your career or business. The author presents and explains master principles on how to raise the quality of your mental, emotional and physical energy." />
