Its publication coincides with the increasing availability in the West of modern preparations of these time-honored herbal remedies. [Encompassing medicine, massage, cosmetics and folklore, jamu is as applicable to today&amp;#8217;s lifestyles as it was in the rarefied world of the ancient Javanese palaces where it was perfected.]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Complemented by explanatory photographs shot on location, Jamu is the first definitive reference to this exotic yet practical healthcare system.&lt;/div&gt;" />
