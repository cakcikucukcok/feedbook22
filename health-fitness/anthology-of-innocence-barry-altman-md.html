  <title>Anthology of Innocence - Barry Altman Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For author Dr. Barry Altman, growing up in an urban atmosphere during World War II made for a frightening childhood. Children like him latched onto dreams of success but also sometimes failure as they gleaned attitudes from their parents and elders. Also, at that time, urban children, particularly those in New York grew up faster, gaining knowledge from their environment more quickly than their parents might imagine. In Anthology of Innocence, Altman presents a collection of autobiographical sketches from his childhood during that precarious time.
In the first sketch, Torture, he tells how, as a young child, his fears and rage were propagated by a close aunt. The story Loss depicts what he saw and felt when a loved one died. A Fish Story explores Altmans questionable relationship with his father, while Thou Shalt Not enters into his world of sexual questioning and indecision. 
Anthology of Innocence reveals the maturation process of a child during the war years with the constant questions and situations that he faced. It narrates the trials and challenges as well as the warmth and closeness of family life." />
