  <title>The Synergistic Life Style - Ron Travis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Ron&#39;s book, &quot;The Synergistic Life Style - How To Set Goals And Live A Balanced and Abundant Life&quot;, contains fourteen chapters covering the different areas of our lives that we should set goals and strive to achieve in: Commitment - Goals - Budget - Feedback - Problems - Spiritual - Mental - Emotional - Physical - Marriage - Children - Support Group - Financial - Work.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ron and June have taught senior high school students and beginning couples in church classes and seminars during the past 40 years. They have now followed these young people long enough to know that the teaching points contained in this book work.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ron and June have learned many of the principles shared in the book while experiences problems in their lives, which they share with the reader. They know that if you fail in one area of life, it will have a negative effect in other areas.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are so many threats to individuals and families that are trying to live an abundant life. The negative influences are greater today because of the fast pace of life, and the delivery systems for these influences on our children. The threats include: divorce - negative influence from the media - materialism - absentee fathers - alcohol and drug use by one of the parents - the availability of alcohol and drugs around schools - pornography on the internet - morality not being taught at home - medical depressiuon - and a need for both parents to work just to keep up.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Each chapter includes Ron&#39;s beliefs about the things needed to live an abundant life. When you add up all of the lessons learned in each chapter, the synergistic result will be a balanced life greater than the sum of each area..&lt;/P&gt;
