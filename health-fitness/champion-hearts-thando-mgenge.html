  <title>Champion Hearts - Thando Mgenge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Champion hearts is a book delineating the pitfalls fuelled by hunger for success. It was inspired by the events observed in the workplace while I was shaping my career. Factually the observation started at the university subsequent to my conversion to Christianity. Looking at the world in the precepts of Christ helped me realise that we human species are doing massive damage than good on earth. Learning that university promotes rational thinking in general confused me because that is the place where I saw the most skewed thinking exercised. Academics showed me one thing that has engulfed every area of life: they taught that a person should mind their own business. Academics do this disfavour excellently because they should appear broadminded. A broadminded makes everyone feels at home. Feeling at home means doing as you please.  I continually asked my heart that if it knows the truth that should be told how can I mind my business because I am not an island?  Before reaching the workplace situations we face in tertiary institutions initiates us for the animal kingdom. Animal kingdom is the workplace that has no moral teaching where everyone fights to survive.  It is a place where people have a make believe thought of a punitive free world. It is a place where people have a make believe thought of a consequence free world for their immodest deeds. Sadly whatever is done in the secret shall one day be in the light. Before it is in the light a heart that has committed despicable deed fights impossible war of hiding the secret. This game always puts a fighter in vulnerability. As old as I am I have never heard of someone who ever won the conscience fight.
To prove my statement sit down a friend who trusts you as the confidant. Go down memory lane with them to check what really bothers them most. Decisions done with the hope of fulfilment that did not bring happiness are the main regrets many souls are suffering from. Whereas other deeds are easily traced because of the glaring evidence of their happenings there are those that require the victim to confide in someone. Such things are a burden that many souls have decided to harbour. In the process achievements are put tops at the expense of the hearts rest. A heart not at rest with its soul is life poorly led. I am afraid to say that in the quest for success we have Christian sisters who have decided to make sure that they stay in the league of the achievers according to the worldly standards and failed to foresee the after-effects one must try to suppress for the rest of her life if ignoring conscience remains the only option in the eyes of the victim. Calling this person victim is a sympathetic terminology. Really this person is a volunteer victim. She is a volunteer victim because she voluntarily chose to ignore scriptural advice. 
Fortunately the same volunteer victim can be a heroine. If one has been bartered they can be used by God to help possible future victims avoid mistakes. It starts by warning them of the dangers of choosing the wrong loftiest dream in place of taking God at His word in the scriptures about our safe providence in His hand. A heart devoted to helping others avoid pitfalls becomes a champion heart in heavens. Creator uses it again for His master plan in restoring lost mankind. In that way more champions are encouraged to hold fast till Messiah comes back. That is the message of the cross. I like the Father for remaining faithful to His promises. He promised to never leave us nor forsake us. This He has done in my life and that of many believers on this planet. I can say being a champion heart is the long term process that requires constant reviewing of the championship status otherwise champions may grow complacent and die emotional paupers hence permanently backslidden elect. 
This book takes a deep look at the woman who decided to ignore God. Nomusa made the common silliest mistake of sleeping her way to success. She did that after experiencing" />
