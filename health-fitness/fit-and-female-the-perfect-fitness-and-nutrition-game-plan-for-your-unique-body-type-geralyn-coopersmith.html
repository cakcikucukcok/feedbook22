  <title>Fit and Female: The Perfect Fitness and Nutrition Game Plan for Your Unique Body Type - Geralyn Coopersmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;No one understands what it means to be fit and female better than Geralyn Coopersmith. Her work has brought results to women nationwide.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Carol Espel, MS, National Director of Group Fitness for Equinox Fitness Clubs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Every woman should read Geralyn&#39;s book.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Michael Boyle, author of Functional Training for Sports&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Coopersmith leads the reader to new levels of self-awareness and the ability to make educated choices. Underlying her hip, upbeat tone is a sound background in exercise physiology and a strong desire to help women improve their lifestyles.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Joan Pagano, author of Strength Training for Women&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever wonder why some women look great with very little effort while others exercise and diet obsessively with disappointing results? The fact is, when it comes to getting in shape, all women are not created equal. We&#39;ve all heard about apples and pears, but there&#39;s lots more to women&#39;s bodies than just that. If you&#39;ve been frustrated by fad diets and the workout of the month that never seems to work, you need a program designed specifically for your unique body type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Fit + Female, Geralyn Coopersmith, a top fitness expert and certified personal trainer, ditches the one-size-fits-all approach to getting in shape and helps you determine which type you are. Then you get a nutrition and exercise plan that&#39;s tailored for your needs, not just generic, off-the-rack advice. If you want to get back into that clingy little number that now hugs all the wrong places, this is the realistic, scientific how-to for you!" />
