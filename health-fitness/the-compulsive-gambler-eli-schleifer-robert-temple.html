  <title>The Compulsive Gambler - Eli Schleifer, Robert Temple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gambling Fever could have been subtitled The Man Who Must.  That is an apt 
description of the compulsive gambler whose  very existence demands that he must
wager in excess . 
     To the compulsive  gambler  the act of wagering takes priority over eating, drinking,     
personal relationships, sexual activity , earning a living, supporting a family or looking   
after his own health problems. 
     Compulsive gambling is the obsession of all obsessions. A person (man or woman) 
will lie, cheat, steal and embezzle in order to feed his habit. Nothing will deter him.
As more and more states expand legalization of all forms of gambling to  raise much-
needed revenue and create hard-to-find jobs  the problem is increasing by leaps and 
bounds.    The book concludes that few resources are devoted to dealing with this issue
and raises the question of whether any treatment can cure the obsession.
     Gambling Fever traces the history of gambling, quotes numerous references 
throughout history by famous writers such as Shakespeare and Dostoevsky,  
psychologists such as Sigmund Freud,  statesmen,  conquerors, clergymen,  entertainers 
and others  who have either struggled with gambling or analyzed  the gambler. 
     Finally, the book also serves as an  insight into  Eli Schleifer,  the man  who 
struggled  his entire life with his demonsthose of the compulsive gambler." />
