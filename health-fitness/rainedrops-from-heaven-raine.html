  <title>Rainedrops from Heaven - Raine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Rainedrops from Heaven&lt;/i&gt;, Raine, spiritual medium, shares experiences through both her own and her clients facilitation with those entities on the other side of the veil. This is a very inspiring book that takes the reader on a journey of discovering the possibilities of life after death.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Raine introduces past lives that include personal experiences as well as clients, under clinical hypnosis, revealing glimpses of past-life recall. This is an opportunity for the reader to deepen their understanding on these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book became an award-winning book by winning the NABE Pinnacle Book Award 2015, Readers Favorite Five-Star Book Award, and The Authors Show 2015 50 Great Writers You Should Be Reading. My thanks goes to the competition organizers of these prestigious awards.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Raines previous book, And Rainedrops Fall Down My Cheeks, received two awards for her expertise in writing (NABE and Readers Favorite). Rainedrops from Heaven gives a deeper insight of spiritual learnings for those looking for spiritual guidance and validation. Readers will appreciate the easy way of writing Raine uses as they become more aware of both their surroundings and those around them that are unseen. This book will open yearnings within you for more knowledge of your spiritual potential. It is truly an inspired book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
