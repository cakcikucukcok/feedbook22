  <title>Are There Still Good Men &amp; Women Around Today? - Patricia M. Solomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We have seven sisters looking for good men and it will lead them to Washington DC and there they find some good men but they have issues to deal with not to mention some problems that the sisters will not tolerate at all. They will need to pass a test from their Uncle who has the family business under his authority and will not let just any one come into the family. They have issues and problems their uncle sees that they are crazy about these boys and they might even be in love with these boys but some of them have baggage and he decides to help them with their problems and their habits for his nieces sakes. He finds the lady of his dreams during the process and so does his sons. The men from Washington DC have taken on a contract for the company and in one year they will get the contract or lose it either way the Uncle&#39;s will be a winner. The guys show their talents but will they get the contract and the girls they have fallen madly in love with and changed their ways too. We also find out they arent the only ones looking for good men and women. We all have a past that we may not be proud of but we all can look to the future for change if we only try hard to do whats right. The future will be a big picture for all of us if we only look, listen and do what thus said the Lord says. This is just my opinion and I am not criticizing anyone in this story. We all have sin and I cannot point my figure at anyone unless I point it at myself sin is sin no matter how big or small in the eyes of the Lord. This book is to inspire those who will read it and have an open mind. The Lord wants us all to take inventory on ourselves and be mindful and not judge others. I really hope you all will enjoy what you have read. May the Lord guide you on your way to happiness and more?" />
