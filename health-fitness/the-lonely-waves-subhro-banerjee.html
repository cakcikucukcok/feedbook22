&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;Narayan Sharma, Arjun Sinha and Rajeev Agarwal were very successful in their own profession. But at a particular juncture of their lives, they started to feel that no body in this world loved them any more and slowly they were becoming redundant. Loneliness gripped them. They lost the interest of life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;By different coincidences, they came close to one another. They started realizing that they were not alone in the world. With this friendship, they started to feel the joy of living. Now they knew that they were having friends, who were thinking about them and loving them. They decided that they would never get separated from one another.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;They went to &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Kashmir&lt;/st1:place&gt;, the paradise on the earth. Their main intension was to relax and enjoy the companies of the others.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;But they were unaware of the fact that a conspiracy was going on to kill Rajeev by a notorious criminal. When they realized, they were scared and wanted to escapefromthe &lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceType&gt;valley&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt; of &lt;st1:PlaceName&gt;Kashmir&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; and take Rajeev to some safe place and save him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;But would they be able to do that?&lt;/P&gt;
