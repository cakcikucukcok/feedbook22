  <title>The Cure - J. L.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faith, its a word that describes a belief in something that you cant truly know exists.  Faith is someone standing in front of a closet telling you that there is gold inside and that you will get that gold at some point if you can just trust that it is there.  Whats to stop you from looking in the closet?  So many people believe that there is gold in the closet, so maybe you should too.  The feeling of the possibility of getting the gold is so intense, it is just enough to make it so you dont try and peek inside the closet.  The funny thing about faith is that without numbers, it wouldnt exist.  Yet, your faith belongs to you; you own it in the most complete sense.  It is you that owns this faith and it is you that decides what to make of it.  People get mad when something makes them question their faith, yet the only one that can question your faith is you.  No man, woman, movie or book can influence the decision you have to keep or discard your faith.  In the end, you are the one who decides the direction of your life.&lt;p&gt;
 This book provides a peak into the closet.  It gives you the choice to either believe that you do see the gold, or to believe that there is no gold.  What you decide to see and believe is ultimately up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
This book will help you understand why there is no gold, but instead a much more magical entity.  The closet in reality isnt a box but is an unending future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
