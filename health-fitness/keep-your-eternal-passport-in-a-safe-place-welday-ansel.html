  <title>Keep Your Eternal Passport in a Safe Place - Welday Ansel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is all about a journey. Everybody is on some kind of journey in his life knowingly or unknowingly. For every journey, there is a starting point; in other words, to start a journey, everybody needs a foundation which determines his final destination. If the foundation is wrong, then the whole journey will also be in the wrong direction, and nothing is worse than travelling in the wrong direction throughout your life. If you miss the real root you cant bear the real fruit for your root determines your fruit.
	In the spiritual world, so many people are fake passport holders. They claim to inherit the kingdom of God but they can never inherit it until they accept this truth. The only truth is if Christ is your foundation, then heaven is your destination. Jesus Christ is the only way who can guide you throughout the journey, from the foundation to the final destination. By using the journey of the Israelites for forty years as a model in my book Keep Your Eternal Passport in a Safe Place, we will see how to finish successfully the journey of life from the foundation to the final destination." />
