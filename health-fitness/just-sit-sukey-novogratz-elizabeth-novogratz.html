  <title>Just Sit - Sukey Novogratz, Elizabeth Novogratz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the cofounders of &lt;em&gt;The Well Daily&lt;/em&gt;, a playfully-illustrated, informative, and easy-to-use meditation guidebook&amp;#8212;including an eight-week plan for busy novices&amp;#8212;that helps even the busiest would-be meditator incorporate this practice into their lifestyle and enjoy its many physical and emotional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all heard the reports about meditation: that it helps us relieve stress and anxiety, improve our moods, lose weight, and sleep better. We know that it can make us healthier, nicer, a kinder parent, a better coworker, a more thoughtful spouse. But there&amp;#8217;s a catch&amp;#8212;you actually have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written for the many, many people whose schedule or skepticism has kept them from trying meditation, &lt;em&gt;Just Sit&lt;/em&gt; is an approachable and visually engaging beginner&#39;s guide. Assuaging fears, answering questions, and providing real-world information to demystify the process, Sukey and Elizabeth Novogratz provide a hands-on look at what meditation really is, what is does, and how to do it. The authors make clear that meditation doesn&#39;t have to be complicated or follow a specific protocol. The most important part, to &quot;just sit,&quot; can lead to a lifelong practice, tailored to anyone&#39;s lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A perfect blend of information and instruction, &lt;em&gt;Just Sit&lt;/em&gt; covers everything you wanted to know but were too afraid to ask. Sukey and Elizabeth address meditation myths and realities, offer advice on how to combat awkwardness, extoll the physical and emotional benefits of meditation, show readers how to find those precious minutes to meditate every day, and more. They also include an eight-week plan to get help readers kick start&amp;#8212;and stay with&amp;#8212;their own daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to ditch the excuses. With this warm, encouraging, sassy guide, everyone will want to show up&amp;#8212;and sit down&amp;#8212;every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
