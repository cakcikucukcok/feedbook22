  <title>I&#39;m Sick of Being Fat! - Sarah Jane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You have tried umpteen things trying to lose the weight. You may even have had success, but then it piles back on PLUS more&amp;hellip;. You need to get off this insane merry-go around, once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t give up, all the things you have done to lose weight before haven&amp;rsquo;t worked and it&amp;rsquo;s not your fault, here&amp;rsquo;s why &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIRSTLY, losing weight is far more complicated than just calories in versus calories out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t cut back on food trying to lose weight by deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t drive a car with no fuel in the tank, would you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do this to your body?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECONDLY, you try exercising. I can hear so many groans even at the slightest mention of that word. But the experts tell you that to lose that fat around your tummy and sitting on your hips, you must burn it off. You MUST exercise and lots of it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So off you go and take your hard-earned cash over to the gym with mirrors floor to ceiling on every wall &amp;ndash; you cannot escape your own sorry reflection. Then the personal trainer with the perfect body smoothly signs you up for an expensive membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are very motivated for the first couple of weeks. On you leap onto the treadmill or the elliptical machine and you work on it for hours and hours. Lots of cardio &amp;ndash; they said. But still not having any significant results to show for all your hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You go to a group class and you just can&amp;rsquo;t keep up, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to jump - your joints are sore, every part of your body jiggles and wobbles and you just feel uncomfortable and embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &amp;hellip;you give up, but you still must pay for your gym membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just another thing that&amp;rsquo;s failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THIRDLY, you begin to search for something quick. &amp;ldquo;There must be a &amp;lsquo;SECRET&amp;rsquo;! That&amp;rsquo;s the missing link.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blinded by the internet hype of Cold Press this, Organic that and drink this Super food blah blah and magically the weight will just disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous, but you&amp;rsquo;re DESPERATE to get a result after so much effort. You&amp;rsquo;ve lost hope. You think it&amp;rsquo;s your fault. Wasted time, effort, money and most importantly your health suffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE GOOD NEWS IS IT DOESN&amp;rsquo;T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will show you how you can get your body back without feeling hungry and without feeling like it&amp;rsquo;s another crash diet drag. AND&amp;hellip; the results you achieve will be PERMANENT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah Jane. I was once sick of being fat and have done something about it and now I want to share my experience and HELP YOU TOO!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will show you the easy way to balance your hormones and get your body working in sync to rid your excess weight. In fact, on average 1-2Kg weight loss within 5 days* as you rid your body of inflammation. (*Results vary from person to person).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In my book, I will show you exactly how to&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to balance your hormones so that your body no longer holds onto fat.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to re-wire your body to use fats as its source of metabolic energy instead of addictive sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to heal your body from &amp;lsquo;dis-ease&amp;rsquo; and add years back to your life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And much more&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- NO MORE mood swings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;nbsp; NO MORE of that ugly cellulite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- NO MORE grabbing fists full of fat from around your hips, tummy and thigh and feeling ashamed of what you have let yourself become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- NO MORE crash dieting. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;After all life is just too precious, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
