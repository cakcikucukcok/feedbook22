  <title>Central Equilibrium - John E. Olsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Between the covers of this little book are thoughts and plausible solutions from a Viet Nam combat veterans perspective on issues facing each and every one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the intriguing chapter titles draw you into the insight John has received from his many life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of today, faced with the challenges now presented by changes in our environment, created by humanity, John offers possible solutions and a fresh view of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rather unique book in that it includes a collection of Johns short stories (written in college) and a collection of Johns poetry (written when he was a patient at Tripler for PTSD) and a summary of his life from birth to the present time (including photographs) and Johns bookCentral Equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of what is included in this book was thought about by John twenty-five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last chapter contains Johns proposal for the people of planet Earth to build the largest structure ever conceived or attempted by humankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other chapters in this book are some of Johns solutions and thoughts of the present and his visions of the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
