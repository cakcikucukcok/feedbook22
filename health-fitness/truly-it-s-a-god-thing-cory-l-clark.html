  <title>Truly It’S a God Thing - Cory L. Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wouldnt ever tell someone to stop going to church, but God might. Thats what he did to me, and this book is a testimony of the real love of God and what he can do for you if you so choose to be led by his Spirit. This journey happened in the Spirit, and it happened all the same in reality. It has affected me and those around me, and the church will not agree with most of this because it isnt based on their principles of manipulation and control. The stories in this book are true to the best of my memory and the journey that I have endured. It is here to help set you free from religious mind-sets, to help you learn how to be led by Gods Spirit, and to help you learn who you are through him." />
