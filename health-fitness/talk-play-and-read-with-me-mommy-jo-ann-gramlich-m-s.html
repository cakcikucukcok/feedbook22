  <title>Talk, Play, and  Read with Me Mommy - Jo Ann Gramlich M.S.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Did you know that you can begin to talk and interact with your child as
early as birth? If you did, then youre on the right track to getting your
child ready for the infant, toddler, and preschool years. If you didnt,
Talk, Play, and Read with Me Mommy will provide you and your child
with many stimulating activities and games that are developmentally
appropriate and designed to help enhance your childs speech and
language skills. There are interactive activities for infants (e.g., Rattle
Time, Lots of Sounds, Peek-a-Boo), toddlers (e.g., Surprise Bag,
Flashlight Fun, Bear Talk), and preschoolers (e.g., Listen Up, Hunting
for Colors, Silly Stories). These games can be played when you and
your child have a few extra minutes during daily routines, playtime,
or story time. You can also use this book when you are on the move,
so make sure you carry it wherever you go." />
