  <title>The Final Audit - Carnie Matisonn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A phenomenal, inspirational, true, and touching story, The Final Audit presents the thought-provoking tale of one mans attempt to explain his existence to his children, embarking on a portrayal of his life with Gulliver as his guide and mentor.  Author Carnie Matisonn shares his fascinating history, including his lifelong wish to trace valuable artwork stolen from his family by the SS in Nazi-occupied Norway during World War II.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;His tale starts with an impoverished childhood in a family devoid and incapable of love, leaving a twelve-year-old boy to survive in a rickety caravan on his own during the post-World War II era. Despite his circumstances, Matisonn peppers his narration with dry humour and irony. He recalls life in the cosmopolitan mining city of Johannesburg during the 1950s and fighting anti -Semitism in an effort to improve his situation through education and a high work ethic. As he achieves huge highs and terrible lows in both his career and marriage, he remains focused on the missing artwork, inadvertently becoming involved with Mossad in an attempt to hunt down a Nazi war criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matisonn finds himself duped into smuggling a Nazi descendent into South Africa by helicopter, flying sorties for the police force, and  racing against time to recover treasures of artwork hidden in the cliff s of the Atlantic seaboard with the tide rushing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through ups and downs, excitement and hard work, triumph and tragedy, Matisonn shares the story of a truly amazing life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
