  <title>Dating in the Millennium - Alicia S. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate, Matthew 19:6
Good communication openly and honestly is ideal when it comes to dating and marriage.
Many women aspire to share a covenant relationship with the opposite sex, and really
don&#39;t bargain for being labeled as girlfriend #2, friend, baby momma, or any other label or title
that is given to them other than wife or fianc
. As young girls and young adults most aspire to be
married, have a family, and be in a one-on-one committed relationship. A relationship is like any
living plant that requires sunlight, nurturing, and water. If you don&#39;t water it and provide it with
enough sunlight, water and care, it dries up and dies. This holds true for any relationship between
a man and a woman. Love makes the world go round. When cultivating a healthy and fruitful
relationship, the relationship should be a win-win for both parties involved. It is important to
begin a relationship with honesty, integrity, respect and trust. Ask God daily to lead, guide, and
advise you so that you can make sound decisions when it comes to dating and marriage. He always
give us signs when things are not right so pay attention to the things that are going on around
you and in your life. Take time to do some soul searching and get in tuned with yourself and start
asking yourself some very important questions. What truly makes you happy? And what is the
real defi nition of love and what does it mean to you? Remember, you cannot make someone else
happy if you&#39;re not happy with yourself. Live for you and do what makes you feel the happiest
whether your family and friends agree or disagree. At the end of the day whatever choice or
decision you make, you are the one who have to live with it." />
