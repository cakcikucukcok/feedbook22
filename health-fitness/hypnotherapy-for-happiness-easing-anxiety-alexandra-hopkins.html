  <title>Hypnotherapy for Happiness: Easing Anxiety - Alexandra Hopkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;So many people suffer with anxiety and yet dont know why. The symptoms &lt;br /&gt;
dont make sense, there seems to be no control over it, and therefore no &lt;br /&gt;
changing it. Most people resign themselves to living with it forever. &lt;br /&gt;
Amazingly, there is a very simple answer to easing anxietyand yet most &lt;br /&gt;
people would overlook it, because they dont know how and why it works &lt;br /&gt;
so easily. Find out for yourself how easy it can be, and take the first step to &lt;br /&gt;
improving your life  free of anxiety! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her book, Alexandra not only demystifies hypnotherapy and offers insights &lt;br /&gt;
in to why we react the way we do, but she also offers us hope by explaining in &lt;br /&gt;
everyday language how hypnosis can help us change our reactions. This is no &lt;br /&gt;
text book that you have to wade through to find an answer. Its filled with case &lt;br /&gt;
studies and examples explained in everyday language, and after reading this book &lt;br /&gt;
everybody will understand the possibilities offered by hypnotherapy. &lt;br /&gt;
Elizabeth Bezant, writing coach, Perth, Western Australia &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an enlightening, informative and yet simple book for anyone who wants &lt;br /&gt;
to understand the world of hypnotherapy and the important role the subconscious &lt;br /&gt;
has in the way we think and feel. &lt;br /&gt;
