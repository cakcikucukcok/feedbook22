  <title>Women &amp; Recovery: Sex, Sobriety, &amp; Stepping Up - Ann D. Clark PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Women and Recovery: Sex, Sobriety and Stepping Up&lt;/i&gt;, Ann D. Clark, Ph.D, provides readers with a no-nonsense, step-by-step guide to giving up anything. Clark explains how to conquer addictions using a lighthearted approach. Addressing such problems as substance abuse, overeating, shopping, or simply patterns in relationships, she gives her practical tips from a very relatable and realistic experience: her own. The journey into recovered living and self-knowledge is the purpose for this collection of experiences, and the suggestions found in &lt;i&gt; Women and Recovery&lt;/i&gt; can make that journey smoother and more enduring for readers and their loved ones.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Whether you are dependent on relationships, food, drama, drugs, alcohol, or the alcoholic, this guide offers assistance. You do not have to have used drugs to experience the pain of withdrawal-sugar, food, relationships, or even caffeine will do. &lt;i&gt;Women and Recovery&lt;/i&gt; is for those who seek to improve their quality of life, obtain a lasting and significant relationship, and gain practical advice.&lt;/P&gt;" />
