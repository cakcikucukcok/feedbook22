  <title>The Parents&#39; Guide to Hip Dysplasia - Betsy Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Parents&amp;#8217; Guide to Hip Dysplasia&lt;/I&gt; is the only consumer guide to one of the most common birth defects in our nation! Now instead of having to comb through medical texts or scour the internet for information, concerned parents of children with hip dysplasia can have all the information they need for treating their children at their fingertips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hip dysplasia affects 1 in 1,000 babies, either as developmental hip dysplasia (DDH) or congential hip dysplasia (CDH). With this condition, the child&amp;#8217;s hip joint structure does not fit together normally, and the problem can grow worse as the child grows. If untreated, the condition can cause serious hip problems in adulthood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fortunately, this condition responds well to medical treatment, and this book guides concerned parents through all of the options and obstacles of treating a child with hip dysplasia. The book covers hip anatomy, risk factors, how diagnosis is made, how to communicate with doctors about the condition, and covers harnesses, braces, casts, surgery, and potential complications for children ages 0-17. The book also addresses the special care needs of children with hip dysplasia and how to manage pain at home. It concludes with a list of resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Author Betsy Miller was treated for hip dysplasia as a child, and she was inspired to write this book to provide support and information to parents in an accessible, reader-friendly format.&lt;/div&gt;" />
