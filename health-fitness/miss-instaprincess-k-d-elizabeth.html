  <title>Miss InstaPrincess - K.D. Elizabeth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lena Douglas may be a world-famous Instagram model, but she hates it. She&amp;#39;s a real InstaPrincess, reigning over her court of perfectly airbrushed selfies and avocado toast posts, but at twenty-six, she&amp;#39;s running out of time before the Internet moves on to a younger model. Starting her own fitness line is the perfect escape.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But the thing about new companies? They kind of need a little cash. A mentor who can show Lena how to run a business wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt, either. Fortunately, she&amp;#39;s rented the house of a man who could be her perfect business partner. If she agrees to accompany him to events as his date, he might just fund her line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too bad she doesn&amp;#39;t have time for distractions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too bad her new neighbor is stupidly attractive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too bad he&amp;#39;s the neighbor from hell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Travis Grant has spent his entire career building his father&amp;#39;s construction company into the success it is today. Now that his father has finally handed the reins over to him, Travis is more than ready to take that success to a whole new level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The perfect way to do that? Do a killer job constructing the new civic center for Travis&amp;#39; small Arizona town, a desperately-needed new building to keep the town afloat. The only problem? Not everyone is sure Travis can handle such an important project, especially John Masterson, the arch nemesis of Travis&amp;#39; father.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Travis is determined to complete the project without a hitch. But that&amp;#39;s before a beautiful woman moves in next door. A beautiful woman who can&amp;#39;t seem to keep the noise down no matter how many times he calls the police.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too bad he doesn&amp;#39;t have time for distractions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too bad his sleep-deprived mind can&amp;#39;t focus on work because of the racket next door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too bad all he can think about is tasting his new neighbor." />
