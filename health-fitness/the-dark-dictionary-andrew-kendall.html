  <title>The Dark Dictionary - Andrew Kendall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee that the lives we lead will be easy, and our unique storiesboth our inner and outer worldsare shaped by our perceptions. But what happens when our self-defeating behaviors begin to take a toll on our liveson these perceptions? What happens when we forget that our identities are not products of our mind or what were going through? And when were trapped in this endless cycle of misery and negativity we find ourselves settling for lackluster lives, so how do we instead choose to redefine our lives and embrace a world filled with vitality and color?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Dark Dictionary, author Andrew Kendall explores his own personal journey through the selfone that began in darkness but is now paved with self-discovery and improvement. From A to Z, The Dark Dictionary is about transforming the definitions in our lives into the ones weve always imagined living by. But it starts first with releasing ourselves from the very grip that more often than not keeps us stuckanxiety, fear, victimization, poor choices, unhappiness, and toxic relationships. With new definitions of these concepts, new perceptions give rise to new lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all those both seeking and willing to shed a little light on their darkness, this personal yet universal journey can transform a world of darkness into a world of optimism, gratitude, happiness, and abundance. And by applying the knowledge within, youll realize that the keys to success and happiness were qualities you already possessedthat just needed to be brought to light with the power of your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
