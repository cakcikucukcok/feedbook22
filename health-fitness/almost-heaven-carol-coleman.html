  <title>Almost Heaven - Carol Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Port Haven is a coastal village in Maine with a long past connected to the sea. It retains a charm which blends with 21st century conveniences. Older homes, many of which were built for sea captains, line the cobblestone streets which encourage folks to stroll through the village, where the shop window boxes are filled with a variety of flowers or herbs. Their aromas blend with the blissful odors of coffee and bakery fantasies. This leads one down to the lighthouse, which is still functional. The largest historical building in town is the Sea Scape, which is a combined Library, Bookstore and Book Nook, which is a coffee shop and bakery. There is an outside seating area that is surrounded by herbs, flowers and grape arbors. 
Margaret Scott is one of the primary characters and a descendant of the founders. She is the Librarian/Manager of the Sea Scape. Margarets assistant and beloved companion is a mixed golden lab/sheperd with love and wisdom to share, of which he has an endless supply. This is also where Margaret and Richard first met. The chemistry between them was compelling from their first contact." />
