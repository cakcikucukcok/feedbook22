  <title>Becoming a Genuine Giver - Ken Hultman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Do you want healthier, more effective relationships? If so, &lt;b&gt;Becoming a Genuine Giver&lt;/b&gt; will give you the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve your goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Relationships are central to our very being-our survival depends on them. The capacity to build relationships is the key to personal happiness and career success. Relationships are a matter of give and take, but not all giving and taking is equally healthy or effective. Representing an original scholarly synthesis of developmental, interpersonal, and social psychology, this penetrating book argues the best way to have healthy relationships is to move toward becoming a Genuine Giver: a person who gives to others joyfully in a sincere, non-manipulative manner. This requires a person to identify and overcome specific relationship barriers. You can identify your barriers and growth opportunities through the powerful Interpersonal Motivation Scale, which defines nine types of taking and giving with varying consequences for relationships. Following that, you can develop an action plan for overcoming barriers, using a variety of tools, worksheets, and suggestions included in the book. Here is an insightful and practical resource that can help:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Individuals:&lt;br&gt;
Become more aware of what they really want from others&lt;br&gt;
Pinpoint and overcome specific interpersonal barriers&lt;br&gt;
Build healthier and more effective relationships&lt;br&gt;
Prepare themselves for future relationships&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Teams, Partnerships, and Boards:&lt;br&gt;
Evaluate interpersonal effectiveness&lt;br&gt;
Develop greater mutual understanding&lt;br&gt;
Reduce interpersonal conflict&lt;br&gt;
Build trusting relationships that get things done&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Organizations:&lt;br&gt;
Increase the emotional intelligence of leaders and managers&lt;br&gt;
Evaluate and enhance organizational culture&lt;br&gt;
Measure job candidates for cultural fit&lt;/br&gt;
