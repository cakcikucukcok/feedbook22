  <title>Silent Wail - Esther Atsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Daniela Umars commitment to God is unquestionable. Her amiable personality and charm make her admired wherever she goes. Married to Joshua, a handsome aristocrat and business tycoon, she is surrounded by riches and everything money can buy, as well as three adorable children. But behind this faade is a struggling marriage no one knows about.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly intelligent and likable James Obida, a deputy commissioner in charge of investigation for the Criminal Investigation Division of the Nigerian Police Force, approaches Daniela with concerns about his wife, Patricia, and a plea for assistance. Daniela helps save the couples marriage and facilitates Patricias personal walk with God. But, Daniela finds she wants more; she wants another womans husband, an average man in comparison to her husbands status, whose charm is a passionate nature her billionaire husband desperately lacks. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What begins as a simple attraction soon becomes an obsession. And where all human reasoning and effort fail, can her faith in and love for God and all she holds sacred, save her from this pit her soul has tumbled into?&lt;/p&gt;" />
