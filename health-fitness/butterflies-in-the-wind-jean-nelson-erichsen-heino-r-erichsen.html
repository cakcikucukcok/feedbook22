  <title>Butterflies in the Wind - Jean Nelson-Erichsen, Heino R. Erichsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;The book chronicles not only the adoption of their three children abroad, but follows each of their children (including their biological son) into young adulthood. It vividly depicts their difficulties in raising teenagers in a cross-cultural, transracial home, and also exposes the frightening conditions facing today&#39;s kids in our public schools, including gang issues, drop outs, and culture clashes. It provides valuable insights to parents and non-parents as well. This book was a real eye-opener and awakened me to the harsh realities our teens must face in what I would have thought were quality schools. Although told from a parent&#39;s point of view, they very effectively explored the emotions, indeed the angst, of their teenage children.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Jo-Anne Weaver, adoptive parent of a Chinese daughter placed by Los Nios International, and Senior Acquisitions Editor of Education and Developmental Psychology for Harcourt Brace." />
