  <title>Alzheimer’S—What They Forget to Tell You - Caron Leid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although more and more people are being affected by Alzheimers disease, there is not enough information surrounding the true daily struggle of the disease. Although parts of this story were extremely difficult to write, and worse to ensure that the moments were captured exactly as they were it really is a personal journey. This is a story to inspire people not to take any moment for granted.
This disease does not only rob a person of their memory, it takes their dignity and independence with it. It is a story of testing someones resolve, and realizing that life is truly what you make of it. This story is dedicated to my mother, I love her and I know there are still pieces of her still with me, and that is what I hold on to. I wish I had the information in this book, when my mother was fi rst diagnosed with this horrible disease, but a long with my story, I have put in a lot of
resources that are available to others. It also shows that even though you dont think that you have strength, you fi nd a way and you dont give up. I hope my story inspires you, and at least you can use something in this book, whether the disease affects someone you know, or for preventative care." />
