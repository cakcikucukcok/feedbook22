  <title>The Psychology of Christ - William Cavitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book does not condemn secular counseling. Secular theories are compatible with pastoral counseling and can be used to guide a treatment plan and to implement therapeutic interventions. The thrust of the book is that Christian pastoral counseling must be a tool available to the client because the propensity for success is greater than secular counseling. The book presents a paradigm with justification from Holy Scripture that will aid a client in solving lifes problems and create a model for a life of wellbeing. It reintroduces a text that offers a well traveled and proven path of peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, a text that has been rejected by secular mental health professionals and society in general, but still survives. This text is the Bible.
	If the Holy Bible was used as a road map for society the problems in America would be fewer and less intense. Also once problems did occur the spiritual tools would be readily available along with the counselor to comfort the clients. The counselors, spiritual advisors, and clients would be assured the Author of the Universe would become the primary counselor with proven healing power.
	The books first three chapters lay out an overview of general considerations for counseling using the holistic approach. It emphasizes the influence spirituality has on all aspects of wellbeing and encourages counselors and spiritual advisors to use scripture based interventions to help the client change their ineffective thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and to enhance their wellbeing in life. Succeeding chapters present a windshield tour of experiences illustrating how different incidences and periods can have a profound effect on the physical, psychological, cognitive, social, and moral aspects of life. These incidences and periods were designed by God to make a person who they are and they include hard times and easy times. Good times and bad times mold a persons character into who God desires. The incidences are presented by viewing some experiences in the life of a male named Andy. Readers are introduced to Andys life as he experiences physical, psychological, cognitive, and social growth. It is important to note how Andy develops in these areas of wellbeing via a strong spiritual awakening that envelopes all aspects of his life.  It is recommended that the reader study the first three chapters to obtain a working knowledge of the holistic counseling structure, which is used throughout this book. The messages of this book are equally important to counselors, spiritual advisors, clients, and people in general." />
