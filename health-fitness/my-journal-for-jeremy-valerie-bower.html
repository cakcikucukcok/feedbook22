  <title>My Journal for Jeremy - Valerie Bower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I am Val Bowera daughter, wife, mother, sister, grandmother, and friend. I gave birth to three beautiful children and later adopted two more; I also have four stepchildren. I have spent the majority of my adult life working with people who need some kind of help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually a little bit of stress is a good motivator for me. But when you hear the word cancer and the doctor is talking about your child, your mind does not know what to do. When the next doctor tells you he has two weeksor maybe a monthto live, you pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone once told me that I didnt have enough faith. I was taught to pray, Gods will be done. I said that prayer for months and then added, God give me strength to face the future. I kept a journal of the days and weeks of struggles and hardships, based on this moms feelings. I have no intention of causing pain or anger to anyone; it is all based on my opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wish is that after reading this, parents will hold their babies more often. Sisters and brothers will say I love you and mean it. I wish for families to realize that tomorrow may not come. Every day should have a memory to hang on to.&lt;/p&gt;" />
