  <title>The Friendship Cure - Kate Leaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Our best  friends, Twitter followers, gal-pals, bromances, Facebook friends, and long  distance buddies define us in ways we rarely openly acknowledge. But as a  society, we are simultaneously terrified of being alone and already desperately  lonely. We move through life in packs and friendship circles and yet, in the  most interconnected age, we are stuck in the greatest loneliness epidemic of  our time. It&#39;s killing us, making us miserable and causing a public health  crisis. Increasingly, we don&#39;t just die alone; we die because we are alone. What  if meaningful friendships are the solution?Journalist Kate Leaver believes that friendship is the  essential cure for the modern malaise of solitude, ill health, and anxiety and  that, if we only treated camaraderie as a social priority, it could affect  everything from our physical health and emotional well being. Her much-anticipated  manifesto, The Friendship Cure, looks  at what friendship means, how it can survive, why we need it, and what we can  do to get the most from it. Why do some friendships last a lifetime, while  others are only temporary? How do you &quot;break up+? with a toxic friend? How do  you make friends as an adult? Can men and women really be platonic? What are  the curative qualities of friendship, and how we can deploy friendship to  actually live longer, better lives?From behavioral scientists to besties, Kate draws upon the  extraordinary research from academics, scientists, and psychotherapists, and  stories from friends of friends, strangers from the Internet, and her &quot;squad+?  to get to the bottom of these and other facets of friendship. For readers of Susan Cain&#39;s Quiet and Elizabeth Gilbert&#39;s Big  Magic, The Friendship Cure is a fascinating  blend of accessible &quot;smart thinking,+? investigative journalism, pop culture,  and memoir for anyone trying to navigate this lonely world, written with the  wit, charm, and bite of a fresh voice.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
