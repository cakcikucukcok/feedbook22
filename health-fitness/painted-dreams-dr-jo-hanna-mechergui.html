  <title>Painted Dreams - Dr. Jo Hanna Mechergui</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written to demonstrate acts of faith and the lessons that I learned in life that renewed my faith and made me stronger spiritually.
All things are possible with prayer. Praying allows us to get in contact with our higher being and renewing our faith. This book is filled with short stories that provided spiritual guidance that strengthen the writers spirit. I hope that it provides some spirit guidance to the readers.
Allowing the spirit to guide me has changed my life. It has improved my physical being, restored relationships, improved my financial status, profound peace of mind, and given me confidence and courage to reach my highest potential in Gods will.
Painted Dreams has given color to my prayers. It gives a visual picture to prayers that only God can paint. This picture helps to strengthen our faith and make us stronger spiritually. Let God continued to bless my readers and myself and provide us with divine spiritual guidance." />
