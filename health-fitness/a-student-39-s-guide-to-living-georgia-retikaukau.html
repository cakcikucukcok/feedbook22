  <title>A Student&#39;s Guide to Living - Georgia Retikaukau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At 14 years old I had left home and high school. I was living on a $150 a
week student allowance. I was useless in the kitchen and I knew absolutely
nothing about the importance of keeping up with my bill payments. I became
a student at a Hairdressing Academy and had to take out a $10,000 student
loan to complete the course. I was the only one out of about 30 to get a
hairdressing apprenticeship. I worked really hard towards finishing my
diploma while working, which took me about three years. At the age of 17
I was a senior hairdresser making a decent wage for a girl my age. After 4
years of hairdressing I decided to have a career change. I took up a travel and
tourism course, which focused on flight attending. I had always wanted to be
a flight attendant." />
