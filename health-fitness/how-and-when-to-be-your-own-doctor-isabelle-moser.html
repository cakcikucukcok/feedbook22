  <title>How and When to Be Your Own Doctor - Isabelle Moser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was a physically tough, happy-go-lucky fellow until I reached my late thirties. Then I began to experience more and more off days when I did not feel quite right. I thought I possessed an iron constitution. Although I grew a big food garden and ate mostly &quot;vegetablitarian&quot; I thought I could eat anything with impunity. I had been fond of drinking beer with my friends while nibbling on salty snacks or heavy foods late into the night. And until my health began to weaken I could still get up the next morning after several homebrewed beers, feeling good, and would put in a solid day&#39;s work. When my health began to slip I went looking for a cure. Up to that time the only use I&#39;d had for doctors was to fix a few traumatic injuries. The only preventative health care I concerned myself with was to take a multivitamin pill during those rare spells when I felt a bit run down and to eat lots of vegetables. So I&#39;d not learned much about alternative health care." />
