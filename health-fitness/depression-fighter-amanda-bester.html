  <title>Depression Fighter - Amanda Bester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amanda Bester, born and raised in South Africa, is a go-getter who never had too much to do and was able to multitask to the extent that it exhausted others. Facing the daunting reality of a lifelong battle against depression, she wrote Depression Fighter while on meds and functioning as normally as she can remember being for most of her life, hoping to inspire others like her. Her journey took her from denial through this is only temporary to experiencing more than one collapse after stopping her meds when she felt it was possible. She admits that she still doesnt understand everything about depression and very often becomes frustrated and rebellious because she functions better on meds. But in her words, For the sake of the people I love, my own sanity and leading a normal life, I monitor and take my meds regularly and have for the moment accepted the fact that I am a depression fighter. And that is what Depression Fighter is aboutchoosing to be a fighter in the battle and not a sufferer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
