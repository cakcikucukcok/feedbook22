  <title>Blind Emotions - Gomotsegang Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Blind Emotions is specially written for parents, mainly fathers and how they tend to go wrong while raising female children. It is a true story about a young adult. She has a bright future and a dark past catching up to her. She has never expressed her emotions to her parents but to a psychic. Irrational as her feelings can be, she is entitled to be heard. After all, to err is human. 
Happiness is a young adult with a lot of darkness in her past. Her relationship with her father is a very strange one. She loves her father dearly and nothing can take that love away, but she also has been deeply scarred by her father. Her conflicting emotions are based on her experience with her father and how he raised her. She has her own perception of what and who a father is, and her father was never that when she grew up. She has emotional and physical scarsheartbreaking reminders of how badly she was brought up as a child. Although she had need for nothing, all the money, private schools, and beautiful homes was not enough. All she ever needed was the love, comfort, and friendship of her father. But life had other plans for her. She was a punching bag, a stress reliever, and that almost led her to her own downfall." />
