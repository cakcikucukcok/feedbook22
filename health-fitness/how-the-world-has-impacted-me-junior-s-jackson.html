  <title>How the World Has Impacted Me! - Junior S. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When asked what my book was about, I would almost instantly blurt out self-help; but as the book was coming to an end, I realized that the book was more than just a self-help book. This book is a product of the world and all the people in it. While writing, I knew I wanted to make people feel good about where they were in their lives and where they dream to be. And I believe I did that.
This book takes the reader all over the place. African American history, peoples personal struggles, and just plain old encouragement will be discussed in this book. And I even take it a step further by sharing my personal struggles with everyone. This book should uplift all the readers, and I hope it does just that. So enjoy, and thank you for the support." />
