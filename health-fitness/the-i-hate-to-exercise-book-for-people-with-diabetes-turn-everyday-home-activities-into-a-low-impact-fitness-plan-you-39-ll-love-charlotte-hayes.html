  <title>The &quot;I Hate to Exercise&quot; Book for People with Diabetes: Turn Everyday Home Activities into a Low-impact Fitness Plan You&#39;ll Love - Charlotte Hayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;For most people with diabetes, the first line of defense is adding exercise to the daily routine. Everyone with diabetes should be getting some physical activity into their lifestyle. The key to good diabetes self-care is simple: stay active by making the most of the activities that are already part of a person&#39;s daily life. &lt;I&gt;The &quot;I Hate to Exercise&quot; Book for People with Diabetes&lt;/I&gt; shows people with diabetes how to exercise safely and to add exercise to their lifestyle with minimal difficulty. Readers learn how to ease into more exercise, build an active lifestyle, create a fun, low-impact walking program, set realistic goals, chart and evaluate progress. &lt;I&gt;The &quot;I Hate to Exercise&quot; Book for People with Diabetes&lt;/I&gt; features more than 60 photographs of models performing the specific exercises in the book. Most of these exercises use very simple equipment: a sturdy chair, some hand weights, and some elastic bands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
