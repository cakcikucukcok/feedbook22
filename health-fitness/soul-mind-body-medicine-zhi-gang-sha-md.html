  <title>Soul Mind Body Medicine - Zhi Gang Sha, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Discover Dr. Sha&#39;s Powerful Techniques for Healing Your Soul, Mind, and Body
What is the real secret to healing? Internationally acclaimed healer and author Dr. Zhi Gang Sha gives us a simple yet powerful answer to this age-old question: Heal the soul first; then healing of the mind and body will follow.
In Soul Mind Body Medicine, Dr. Sha shows that love and forgiveness are the golden keys to soul healing. From that foundation, he presents practical tools to heal and transform soul, mind, and body. The techniques and the underlying theories are easy to learn and practice but profoundly effective. They include:
Healing methods for more than 100 ailments, from the common cold to back pain to heart disease to diabetes
Step-by-step approaches to weight loss, cancer recovery, emotional balance, and maintenance of good health
A revolutionary one-minute healing technique

“Just as our thoughts can influence water, our souls can bring healing and balance to our selves, our loved ones, and our world today. Dr. Sha is an important teacher and a wonderful healer with a valuable message about the power of the soul to influence and transform all life. His book Soul Mind Body Medicine will deeply touch you.” 
— Dr. Masaru Emoto, author of The Hidden Messages in Water
“All cultures have produced authentic healers from time to time. Dr. Zhi Gang Sha is such a healer — a man of deep wisdom and compassion, and a gift to the human race.”
— Larry Dossey, MD, author of The Extraordinary Healing Power of Ordinary Things" />
