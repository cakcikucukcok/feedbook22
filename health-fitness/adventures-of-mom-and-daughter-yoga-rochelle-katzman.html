  <title>Adventures of Mom and Daughter Yoga - Rochelle Katzman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through yoga postures, a mom and daughter team travels the world. They meet a prince and princess, see a leprechaun, visit Tuscany, the South of France, and still make it home for Thanksgiving.
We all want our children to have tools to survive and get ahead in this world. What better time to start than when they are young, teaching them values and giving them experiences that will carry them through life? Adventures of Mom and Daughter Yoga provides a very fun way for a parent and child to stay connected, and a way to start your child on a meditative path from a very young age. This is the type of experience that will give your child a good foundation to relate to the Inner Teacher and a good resource to go to whenever he or she needs guidance. I am very proud of the work Rochelle has done.
Sat Nam., Tej Kaur Khalsa, Los Angeles, CA
In [Adventures of] Mom and Daughter Yoga, Rochelle Katzman has created a program for mothers and daughters to experience a more enriched, joyful relationship with each other and gain all the wonderful benefits of yoga at the same time. With Rochelles book and cards in hand, healthy fun and deeper connections between moms and daughters abound!

As a mom and a full time massage therapist, it is important for me to take care of my own wellness. Each week, my daughter and I read one chapter and do the yoga postures from Adventures of Mom and Daughter Yoga and play the yoga cards game, Adventure of Mom and Daughter Yoga Cards. The book and yoga cards game are wonderful. It has given me time to relax and spend quality time alone with my daughter.
Joy Anne, mom, Long Island, NY
Rochelle, youre the best yoga teacher ever! I always look forward to Tuesdays so I can spend time with my mom doing yoga.
