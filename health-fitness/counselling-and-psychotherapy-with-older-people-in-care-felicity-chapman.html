  <title>Counselling and Psychotherapy with Older People in Care - Felicity Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The global population is ageing rapidly yet there is a shortage of skilled professionals able to support the wellbeing of older people in care. Older people can be more vulnerable to mental health issues such as loneliness, anxiety, grief, loss, and cognitive changes, and need therapeutic support that addresses their specific needs and conditions. 
This supportive guide for psychotherapists, counsellors and other professionals working with older people, addresses the growing demand for mental health services for older adults. It covers a range of issues that arise within this demographic including residential living, the referral process, assessment and engagement, and attitudes towards ageing, while contextualising these issues within larger social and political frameworks. The author describes specific interventions such as Narrative Therapy, Reminiscence Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with practical case studies woven in throughout the book." />
