  <title>The Story of Sam Gendusa Sr. and Carmela Lamantia and Family - Camille Gendusa Bluestein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written about the author&#39;s paternal grandparents, their ancestors, and their descendants.  There is information on the immigrant experience, an over view of Chiusa Sclafani and Termini Imerese, Sicily along with maps, and information on foundings.
The book then goes into research done on various members of the Gendusa family in the United States and members of the family still in Sicily. There are lots of photos of family members from past to present.
Letters from Sicily have been translated.  There is even a note from a cousin in Germany.  
Special entries included are meeting relatives in Chiusa Sclafani along with photos of family and land owned by the Gendusa family.
There is a fascinating obit of the author&#39;s brother written in an Oregon newspaper celebrating his life as an artist.
Information on the origin of the surname is given as well as the family&#39;s coat of arms.  The adventures of Sam Jr. on the freight trains during the depression and the CCC camps is also included.
Genealogy and history are closely linked.  A study of genealogy is a personal study of history." />
