  <title>A Guide to Healthy Living - Apollone S. Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Much has been written recently about healthy lifestyles, safe weight loss and dieting. Most of the programs designed have proven to be too costly to maintain and involve stringent guidelines that place too much burden on the individual to adhere to. Moreover, once broken result in the individual reverting to the old way of eating and living, return of weight and the practice of unhealthy lifestyle.
This program is designed to give you an understanding of the life long benefits of healthy living and the way you can incorporate it into your daily lifestyle at little or no additional cost. All it takes is some minor adjustments in the way you eat and organize your daily activities. It is hoped that a responsibility to self will be instilled in every reader as the reality of the distinct connections between nutrition, exercise and chronic, non-communicable diseases are realized." />
