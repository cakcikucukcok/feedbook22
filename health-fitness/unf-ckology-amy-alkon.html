  <title>Unf*ckology - Amy Alkon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy Alkon presents &lt;i&gt;Unf*ckology&lt;/i&gt;, a &quot;science-help&quot; book that knocks the self-help genre on its unscientific ass. You can finally stop fear from being your boss and put an end to your lifelong social suckage. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you spent your life shrinking from opportunities you were dying to seize but feel &quot;that&#39;s just who I am&quot;? Well, screw that! You actually can change, and it doesn&#39;t take exceptional intelligence or a therapist who&#39;s looking forward to finally buying Aruba after decades of listening to you yammer on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transforming yourself takes revolutionary science-help from Amy Alkon, who has spent the past 20 years translating cutting-edge behavioral science into highly practical advice in her award-winning syndicated column. In &lt;i&gt;Unf&lt;/i&gt;*&lt;i&gt;ckology&lt;/i&gt;, Alkon pulls together findings from neuroscience, behavioral science, evolutionary psychology, and clinical psychology. She explains everything in language you won&#39;t need a psych prof on speed-dial to understand--and with the biting dark humor that made &lt;i&gt;Good Manners for Nice People Who Sometimes Say F*ck&lt;/i&gt; such a great read. She debunks widely-accepted but scientifically unsupported notions about self-esteem, shame, willpower, and more and demonstrates that: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Thinking your way into changing (as so many therapists and self-help books advise) is the most inefficient way to go about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The mind is bigger than the brain, meaning that your body and your behavior are your gym for turning yourself into the new, confident you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Fear is not just the problem; it&#39;s also the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- By targeting your fears with behavior, you make changes in your brain that reshape your habitual ways of behaving and the emotions that go with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Amy Alkon&#39;s groundbreaking advice in &lt;i&gt;Unf*ckology&lt;/i&gt;, and eventually, you&#39;ll no longer need to act like the new you; you&#39;ll &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; the new you. And how totally f*cking cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;" />
