  <title>Stories for Getting Back to Sleep - Diane Gillespie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book, educational psychologist Diane Gillespie, PhD, uses her knowledge and understanding of stories to craft sleep scenarios designed to help people fall back to sleep in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;
The stories are set in relaxing places conducive to sleep: cozy mountain cabins, luxurious spas, a tropical beach, an overstuffed chair in a Victorian Bed and Breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;
In each story, the character secures her surroundings. Then through the process of attending to peaceful details in the setting, she relaxes her body, lets worries float away and sinks deeper and deeper into stillness&amp;mdash;until she is sound asleep.&lt;br /&gt;
Readers are encouraged to remember the sequence of events so that in darkness they can crawl back into bed, pull up their covers, imagine themselves in the stories and go back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your approach to insomnia is absolutely brilliant and so unique.&amp;nbsp; I wholeheartedly recommend this book to others with insomnia. I go to sleep visualizing myself in one of these stories and I quickly go back to sleep. I feel so much better&amp;mdash;like an actual human being&amp;mdash;since having these stories in my nightlife.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; ~Gillian Shapiro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This remarkable book of sleep stories will contribute to your overall wellbeing, helping you to get more sleep. But there&amp;rsquo;s more. The author is donating its earnings to Tostan, an award-winning nonprofit that is increasing the well being of communities across West Africa. Now who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep better knowing that?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; ~Mark Wheeler, MD&lt;/p&gt;" />
