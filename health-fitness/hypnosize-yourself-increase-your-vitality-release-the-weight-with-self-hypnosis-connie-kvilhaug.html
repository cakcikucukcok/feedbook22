      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;HypnoSize Yourself: Increase Your Vitality-Release The Weight With Self-Hypnosis &lt;/i&gt;is written for those searching for an alternative solution to their weight or food issues and desire to move beyond their old way of thinking. People are seeking new options to help them release excess pounds and take back control of their health. This book is intended for serious-minded individuals seeking to improve their health and increase their vitality through the power of their own mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this book, you will learn how to &quot;HypnoSize Yourself,&quot; meaning that with the use of self-hypnosis, you can be your ideal size. I specifically use the term &lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;Release The Weight&lt;i&gt;&quot; &lt;/i&gt;rather than &quot;lose the weight&quot; as there is a big difference between releasing weight and losing weight. The mind is inclined to find what is lost.  It is no surprise, then, that many who &quot;lose&quot; weight seem to find it again! &quot;Release The Weight&quot; is an easier concept for the mind to accept. The term, &lt;i&gt;&quot;Increase Your Vitality&quot; &lt;/i&gt;is used to remind the reader this book is not only about weight. Vibrant health, higher levels of energy and feeling &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt; are ultimate rewards for making mindset and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;HypnoSize Yourself&lt;/i&gt; is a message not only of hope, but a survey of actual tools and techniques that can help a person release their weight and improve their life; however, this book is only part of the solution. The other part is YOU, the reader: you must want to make changes and be willing to take act" />
