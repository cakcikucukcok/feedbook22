  <title>The International Adoption Handbook - Myra Alperson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For anyone involved in, or thinking about, adopting a child from abroad, &lt;i&gt;The International Adoption Handbook&lt;/i&gt; is an essential guide. The process of international adoption can sometimes seem complex, frustrating, and endless. This step-by-step guide, which provides the necessary hard facts and information -- as well as support through the experiences of the author and others -- will help smooth the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a general discussion of who may adopt and what restrictions may apply, the book goes into the nitty-gritty of what the process entails: choosing where to adopt and how to go about it; using an agency or facilitator; initiating the home study; assembling a dossier; working with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service; knowing the topes of expenses that can be anticipated; and many other issues. In addition, the book provides up-to-date information on resources, including what is available today on the Internet, information that was previously difficult for adoptive parents to find out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally informative are the author&#39;s interviews of a number of adoptive families whose stories are interspersed throughout the book. By sharing their experiences, they help to make the process work for others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
