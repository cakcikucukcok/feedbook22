  <title>The Silent Teachers - Pryamvada Bann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered Why - as human beings we look at a Thundering Waterfall or a beautiful butterfly with such awe!
To grasp a moment in time where all the senses are powerfully charged to almost lift you off of your feet?
The Silent Teachers is a collection of prose, telling short stories about such experiences...
Egs:
Observing bees on my flowering crab apple tree buzzing about their business told me: Life must go on when tragedy strikes.
- Walking along the garden and stopping to smell a rose gave me the promise of hope. Knowing that everything is unfolding as it should.
- Discovering a piece of discarded snake skin helped me to realize the importance of letting go of emotional baggage.
- My grandfathers kaleidoscope taught me to appreciate the uniqueness in people I encounter on this human journey... And much much more
I wish you - The reader to recall your own moments in time where you felt so powerfully charged to almost lift you off of your feet and know It is a Beautiful, Living, breathing world and that we are all a part of this human experience..." />
