  <title>Oh If You Would Only Listen - Laura Feise-Dork.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ahh youth, what a great time in your life. Oh how we change as we grow older. Our hopes, dreams, fears and self-confidence begin to form in our minds as we grow older. Things change. And as they do we learn, we grow and we change. But when you begin to mature and your self-confidence forms in your mind. You learn that it is not necessary to always be in such a hurry. When we are young we think there is just no time to stop and smell the roses. Being older now, I do take the time to stop, and the roses smell so sweet. Now I understand the meaning. Bad things will pass with time. It is up to us to take care of our mind. Marriage is a big change in our life. Now you have to give up some of your privacy, give more than you take, and have a lot more patience. Oh what we learn as we grow. There are so many things going on in our mind. The television used to be entertaining but now it puts all kinds of strange thoughts in your head. Be a careful viewer. It is up to us to keep our mind in order. Our body might shrink as we grow older but our brain continues to grow. Feed it with healthy things." />
