  <title>Self Confidence: Techniques to Overcome Fear &amp; Self-Doubt - Become Unshakeable &amp; Unstoppable - Armani Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;You are the ultimate version of yourself. You are unshakeable. You are unstoppable. Nothing can get in your way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You might say these things to yourself in the mirror before you leave the house in the morning. But do you really believe what you tell yourself?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We live in a world that is constantly focused on getting the next big thing, on proving ourselves to those around us, keeping up with the Joneses, and making our mark. While we&amp;rsquo;re told that we need to stand out to survive, at times it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to shine. We become run down by the constant effort. We get discouraged, distracted, and depressed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But now &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s time to get determined!&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone deals with a lack of self-confidence at some point in their life &amp;mdash; &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt;. No one is exempt. The difference is what you do with yourself once you realize that you&amp;rsquo;re down. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say, &amp;ldquo;Pick yourself back up and keep going,&amp;rdquo; but how do we develop the tools we need in order to do that?&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re looking at the tool kit right now!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Self Confidence: Techniques to Overcome Fear &amp;amp; Self-Doubt - Become Unshakeable &amp;amp; Unstoppable&lt;/i&gt; teaches you time-proven techniques to:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify your &amp;ldquo;shaky&amp;rdquo; times before they happen&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be your own best cheerleader&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Deliver the pep talk you need, right when you need it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make self-reliance and self-confidence work hand in hand&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create a pay-it-forward situation with your close support group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Plus:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Five vital tips to turn any situation into a confidence boost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your self-confidence is much more than just what you look like, what you&amp;rsquo;re wearing, or who you are with. It&amp;rsquo;s all wrapped up in your emotions &amp;mdash; how you feel about yourself in relation to the world. &lt;i&gt;Self Confidence: Techniques to Overcome Fear &amp;amp; Self-Doubt&lt;/i&gt; is based on real experiences, and real psychological truths about how our brains work, and how we can hack them into awesomeness. Whether you frequently suffer from confidence issues or you just need the occasional picker-upper, this book has you covered." />
