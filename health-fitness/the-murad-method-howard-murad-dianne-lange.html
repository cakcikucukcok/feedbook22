  <title>The Murad Method - Howard Murad, Dianne Lange</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The renowned dermatologist&#39;s easy-to-follow, quick-results program to treat skin both inside and out, using widely available products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1972, Dr. Howard Murad has been studying the effects of the environment, nutrition, and lifestyle on skin and creating a skin-care program to slow the aging process. &lt;i&gt;The Murad Method&lt;/i&gt; is the result of his three decades of clinical experience treating more than 40,000 men and women as well as independent research proving the effectiveness of the program. His unique approach to skin care combines external products and internal supplements in a simple regimen that will improve the texture and look of anyone&#39;s skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book clarifies the science behind what Dr. Murad believes is the next generation of skin care, an approach based on what he calls the Water Principle. Rather than relying on a single &quot;miracle&quot; ingredient, this breakthrough program includes a combination of exfoliants, polyphenols and other antioxidants, amino acids, fatty acids, and anti-inflammatory agents that enhance skin hydration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Water Principle is the foundation of Dr. Murad&#39;s unique system for repairing and rejuvenating your skin. The skin is your body&#39;s largest organ, and &lt;i&gt;The Murad Method&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to show you how its appearance directly reflects your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Murad Method&lt;/i&gt; has been clinically proven to: &lt;br&gt;- boost hydration &lt;br&gt;- reduce wrinkles&lt;br&gt;- increase elasticity&lt;br&gt;- improve sun protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By following a regimen that suits your skin type and requires just five minutes, morning and night, for five weeks, you will not only counter the damage that causes aging, but actually reverse the visible signs of aging and reduce wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple, clear charts show you how to customize an anti-aging regimen for your skin type and special concerns. You can assemble your own program, using either Murad or name-brand products. There is an extensive listing of products that contain the key ingredients Dr. Murad recommends in his anti-aging prescription to guide you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information in this book will change the way you think about your skin--and give you the tools you need to make your skin look younger in five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
