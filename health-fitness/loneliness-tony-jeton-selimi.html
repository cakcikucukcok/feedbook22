  <title>#Loneliness - Tony Jeton Selimi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;So connected, yet desperately alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have become accustomed to a new way of being alone together in a technological cocoon that covers up our real pain. Our true essence is hidden behind facades that we show to the world from the fear of being judged, criticized, and rejected. This is what brings us out of a natural state of healthy balance, is the root cause of disease, and what creates the segregation experienced worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;#Loneliness&lt;/i&gt; is a global call for people to redefine themselves in the face of lifes greatest challenges. Comforting, moving, and spiritually practical, this book is a guide to help people break through their apparent loneliness, and shift them toward crowd-nurtured world peace and the next stage in our evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This masterpiece is a must-read book if you are yearning for a complete new way at looking, understanding, and loving the true nature of your essence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sc. Todorche Stamenov&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldview developed here transcends science, dogma, and belief, giving readers a new way to reconnect with their truth, hearts, and Divine within. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Markovski, Self-Esteem Coach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony reveals how inner discord creates our deceptive loneliness, which is spontaneously appearing around the world in the form of war, illness, high divorce rates, financial crisis, and so much more. A life manual that shows us how to extract wisdom from every life adversity to become more balanced, mindful, and heart centered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurie Cagno, Singer-Songwriter&lt;/p&gt;" />
