  <title>The Gift of a Lifetime - Barbara J. Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you performed a little maintenance on your marriage? Once many couples say I do and return home from the honeymoon, they kick back and put their marriages on autopilot. Then when they hit those bumps in the road, they wonder why their unions are on shaky ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage maintenance really isnt any different from anything that needs routine attention. Its pretty logical, really. If you take care of something, its apt to last a lot longer. Peters introduces her formula for building, growing and keeping a marriage healthy and long-lasting. She calls it F.A.C.T.S., a powerful acronym that can strengthen a marriage: F is for Forgiveness, A is for Acceptance, C is for Compassion, T is for Trust and S is for Spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideal for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;         People who are getting married or engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;         Already married and renewing vows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;         Already married and just need to improve what they already have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;         Anyone in a committed relationship who wants it to work for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
