  <title>Not Settling for Less - Donell Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was designed for women as well as men to help someone recognize certain issues that they may be going through in life and how to overcome these issues. There are many issues in life that people choose to deal with, when in all reality they dont have to. Everyone deserves to be happy in one way or another, so this is a stepping-stone to what was once, thought of as the undoable. If there is someone in your life and their not making you happy, you have the right book. Its going to be up to you what you get out of reading this book. Its going to boil down to how much strength that you have to move past these weights that you have in your life. If you dont have anything holding you back, this book will show you all the signs to look for to avoid them. 
So you must understand how to spot and weed them out. Just like a farmer, he goes in and removes the bad weeds and fruit from the good ones. You have to do the same thing. The only difference is the weeds that you are weeding out paint themselves up to look like wonderful weeds, but with the right tools you can still weed them out from the good ones and this book will help you do so. No one deserves to have to put up with nonsense and the good thing is that you dont have to. In order for this to work you to have to admit that you are putting up with nonsense and then you have to take the steps to remove it. If you are in a relationship and youre not happy, youre always arguing and fighting, youre always getting lied to and cheated on, you have the right to move on and be happy. But its up to you to do so. So admit and remove!" />
