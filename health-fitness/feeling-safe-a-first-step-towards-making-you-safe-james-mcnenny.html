  <title>Feeling Safe a First Step Towards Making You Safe - James McNenny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author is a retired attorney who has spent a lifetime in Americas society peacefully resolving controversies his clients had with other persons and companies. Since retiring at the turn of the century, he, like many others, have observed a definite trend in Americas society toward violence. The causes for this unwanted trend are many and obvious but not the subject of this book. Instead this book was written as an awakening to the fact that this trend is leading us all down the road to a sick violent society and it is up to us all to oppose the trend with common sense. Some suggestions for taking a stand against this trend, highlighted in this book are (a) Lets encounter strangers as potential friends with a smile and not a sneer with one hand pressed against a concealed handgun; (b) Lets get rid of lethal handguns altogether and make them as unaccessible to the ordinary citizen as explosives; (c) As parents and grandparents, lets be careful what we teach our kids by word or example. For instance, hate being a word to avoid along with negative feelings toward others who are diff erent; (d) And most importantly, lets put a stop to all killings; in war zones abroad as a way to peace; and on our streets and highways here at home by speeding. And much more! The Author knows that if you follow the suggestions of his book you will not only feel and be safer, you will feel good about yourself and what you do." />
