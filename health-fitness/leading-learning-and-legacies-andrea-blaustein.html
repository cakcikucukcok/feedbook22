  <title>Leading Learning and Legacies: - Andrea Blaustein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leading, Learning, and Legacies: The Principles of Successful Leadership lays out fourteen key principles to find within yourself in order to become a great leader. They are not complex and are not based on formal education, finances, or social standing. These principles can be found in anyone who seeks them out within themselves and are for anyone who wants to help make the world a better place. Leadership is one of the most undertaught set of skills in our young people. Children often demonstrate a desire to learn leadership, but this drive is too often neglected and then lost. The book is written for aspiring young leaders as much as for those established leaders who choose to ensure that they are keeping up with the ever-changing demands on them. There are many books on leadership that are written for corporate America, but very few are written for aspiring community leaders, students, and parents who want to instill leadership qualities in their children. Use it as a journal as well as a guide. Leadership evolves but should always maintain a baseline code of conduct. Leaders are accountable, humble (though not self-effacing), and generous with their time and energy. They are teachers, friends, students, and pillars of strength. This book will teach you how to be one of them, whoever and wherever you are." />
