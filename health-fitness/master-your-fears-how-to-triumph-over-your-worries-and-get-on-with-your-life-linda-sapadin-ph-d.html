  <title>Master Your Fears: How to Triumph Over Your Worries and Get on with Your Life - Linda Sapadin, Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praise for Master Your Fears&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Dr. Sapadin&#39;s fascinating guide to mastering our fears and constant worries is essential reading for these times. She offers readers a practical and powerful set of guidelines for taking control of their strong emotions and building a better life in the process.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Philip G. Zimbardo, Ph.D., professor, Stanford University, and past president of the American Psychological Association&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Master Your Fears is a valuable self-help book written in clear language, with excellent advice, engaging quizzes, creative exercises and lots of anecdotes about people with all types of fears. Dr. Sapadin supportively explains the fearful lifestyle-and how to change the pattern. She connects with readers, venturing beyond theory and case studies, by openly discussing her own fears and how she overcame them. A must-read if you want to lighten your fear and brighten your life.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Carol Goldberg, Ph.D., host and producer of the award-winning TV program Dr. Carol Goldberg and Company&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;In this helpful book, Dr. Sapadin does not take a one-size-fits- all approach to the multifaceted experience of fear. Rather, she provides the reader with concrete, creative suggestions for mastering fears based on one&#39;s fear style. She also includes simple but powerful assignments that help you create positive change in your life. I will be recommending this book to my clients, friends and all those who allow fear to inhibit their lives.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Pauline Wallin, Ph.D., author of Taming Your Inner Brat: A Guide for Transforming Self-Defeating Behavior&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;An inspiring, empowering book that will help any reader who has been paralyzed by fear or overwhelmed by a disorganized and chaotic way of living.

I highly recommend it!&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Barry J. Izsak, president of the National Association of Professional Organizers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Master Your Fears is an excellent book for all those who are living a fearful lifestyle.
