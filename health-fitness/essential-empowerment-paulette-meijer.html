  <title>Essential Empowerment - Paulette Meijer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the twenty-five-plus years I have been a speaker, trainer, coach, consultant and mentor, I have had the pleasure of working with people who have achieved tremendous success in their business and their personal lives. In fact, theyre often the same people. This book evolved out of Essential Empowerment Paint Your New Life Canvas Workshops where participants closely examine their immediate life state, then define, refine and articulate their vision for their future.  Workshop exercises begin and end with life canvases  personal artful expressions of current being and future being. Youll see a few of those personal artful expression scattered throughout the book. Those personal canvases and the aggregate exercises, here and in the classroom, are integral parts of the process of personal development.  Your first thought will be to put that piece of the book aside until after youve read through and evaluated every chapter. Dont dismiss their value. Some words used to describe canvases have been: insightful, enlightening, cathartic, and even illuminating. Indulge me  no, dont indulge me. Do it for you. Become a participant in the progress of your life. Embrace your journey to Essential Empowerment.&lt;br&gt;
I hope to see you at an Essential Empowerment Paint Your New Life Canvas Workshop one day. In the meantime  read on and paint your new life canvas! &lt;br&gt;" />
