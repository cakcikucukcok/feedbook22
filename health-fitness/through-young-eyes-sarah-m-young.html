  <title>Through Young Eyes - Sarah M Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everything in this book has come from my own thought processes, my observations, and is an opportunity for you to see the world through my eyes.
I really do think this book has the ability to have an astounding impact upon your life. This book will challenge you, move you, inspire you, and encourage you to live your best life and to be the best version of yourself. This book acknowledges that there is no good without evil and no success without failure and that we are all simply human, trying to figure this crazy thing called life out together.
The last thing I want to say before I let you delve into the chapters that follow is that I honestly hope you can find something that speaks to you within this book. I hope it is a book that you leave on your bedside table, and whether you are feeling sad, lonely, unmotivated, frustrated, or even happy, you can pick it up and find a chapter that says exactly what you need to hear." />
