  <title>The Sanctuary - James Outhwaite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nine professionals and executives are frustrated by the shattering of their dreams through the unforeseen forces. Each is currently feeling burnt out and has retreated to a health retreat in the Tasmanian wilderness for a week, in order to come to terms with the difficult choices they have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have many similarities:&lt;/p&gt;
They are all in their thirties.&lt;/br&gt;
They have all been highly successful in their life and career to date.&lt;/br&gt;
They have all been recently overpowered by events, with circumstances beyond their control. Their dreams now lie shattered.&lt;/br&gt;
They are all, therefore, subject to severe stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a snow blizzard cuts them off from the outside world, they are left to work things out for themselves. Events quickly spiral out of control after a suicide on the first night, swiftly followed by a tragic murder. Emotions run high, and feelings that are normally hidden in the private mind soon erupt to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, they elect a temporary warden, and he is initially successful in bringing things back to seeming normality. However, the pressure-cooker atmosphere soon reveals further underlying tensions, and the book explores differing reactions to the complex events that unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the totally unfamiliar circumstances, some discover inner strengths they never knew they had, some uncover emotional needs which they seek to fulfill, and some cannot cope. In one week, all are challenged by great tension and, in some cases, a resolution of their deepest fears and concerns. For some, new and lasting emotional relationships are formed. For others, complex career issues are clarified, but some lapse into a crisis of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all, it is an unforgettable week, which changes their lives foreversome for better, some for worse. No one remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;" />
