  <title>Mind Your Diet - Melinda Blackman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=justify&gt;So many diet plans give tremendous details about the physiological processes that make their particular diet successful, but fail to include the psychological elements that are also necessary for adherence to the diet plan.  Hence, the goal of this book is to provide you with the life-long mental tool to adhere to your diet plan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During the course of this book, I will point out several marketing techniques that thwart our efforts toward having a balanced daily diet.  Then, I will show you how to apply psychological techniques the right way to help you stick to your diet plans and live a healthy lifestyle.  This book will help you learn to control the many situations and thoughts, related to eating, that our parents helped to control when we were children. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Long after you have read this book, your self-created wristband with the acronym DIET (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;o &lt;b&gt;I E&lt;/b&gt;at &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;his?) will help remind you of the psychological eating strategies presented in this book.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p font = &quot;arial&quot; align=justify&gt;
Wristbands with the acronym, D. I. E. T.  &quot;Do I Eat This?&quot; inscribed on them can be purchased for $6.00 each. All proceeds will go to the AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION.
