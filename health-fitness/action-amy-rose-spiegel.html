  <title>Action - Amy Rose Spiegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;With whip-smart prose, reminiscent of Roxane Gay and Meghan Daum, Action interweaves Spiegel&#39;s own sexual autobiography with loving advice on one-night stands, relationships, and everything in between.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With whip-smart prose, reminiscent of Roxane Gay and Meghan Daum, Action interweaves Spiegel&#39;s own sexual autobiography with loving advice on one-night stands, relationships, and everything in between.  Action is a book about sex that people won&#39;t feel embarrassed about owning. There are absolutely zero provocatively shaped fruit on the cover, for one. In Action, Amy Rose Spiegel exhorts you to trust yourself and be respectful of others--and to have the best possible time doing the things you search for on the Internet, except in reality. The book covers consent, safety, group sex, gender, and the best breakfast to make for a one-night stand.  Spiegel also includes dissections of threesomes, how to pick people up without being a skeezer, celibacy as a display of autonomy, and, of course, how to clean your room in 10 minutes if a devastatingly lovely side-piece is about to stop by. All told, Action totally doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s weird that you want to try that thing together. In fact, Action is very into it." />
