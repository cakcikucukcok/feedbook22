  <title>Soraya: A Life of Music, A Legacy of Hope - Soraya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;From the moment I met Soraya I knew she was a winner, an amazingly talented and beautiful woman with something very spe-cial. Her total dedication in everything she did and her selfless efforts to help others were and still are an inspiration not only to those of us who have had the privilege to be around her, but also to the thousands of people who still maintain her name and mission. Soraya&#39;s courage to face every challenge is something that I will never forget . . . her words of hope and her music will live on in our souls.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--Ricky Martin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sometimes in life you meet someone special, and you know in that moment that they have a greater view on life . . . Soraya was one of those people. She remains a strong and positive memory for me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; --Bob Waldron, President, Yoplait USA&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Soraya&#39;s music is infinitely intimate and precious, crafted and executed with the love and care of an artisan. There are few complete artists, but Soraya is one of them-- a composer, guitarist, producer, arranger, and singer with a particularly emotive voice. The measure of her worth in the eyes of the music industry was obvious during the 2004 Latin Grammys, when she won the Grammy for the newly created Best Singer-Songwriter category, besting icons like Juan Gabriel, Serrat, and Leon Gieco. Many will remember Soraya as a spokesperson, an educator, and a source of inspiration for so many people who battle cancer. Yet her most lasting legacy is the one she continues to transmit through her songs, her music, and her guitar.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--Leila Cobo, Billboard?magazine" />
