  <title>Black Dog Henry the Hound - Laurence James Kiernan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a parent, you have a duty to read this book. I have heard so many parents say, I cant believe he/she did it. He was so happy. We had a wonderful relationship and life. He had everything he wanted. His friends loved him. He was so popular and had a beautiful girl friend. He was so good at sports. He was the captain of the swim team.
I thought we had a great relationship, but we didnt obviously. Do you want to be this? Do you want to experience this yourself? As a family, distrusting the others usually results when one is lost. This gives my experience and the way everything changes. In my family, the result, which I have seen, is terrible. Therefore, it changes the structure, and the children do not know where they fit in the family. The family turns their mind, and everyone blames each other. The children blame the adults as the leaders of the family. Family complicates those who are reserved. I cant imagine losing my four daughters. Can you imagine losing your child by his own hand? Do you want your family to live like this?" />
