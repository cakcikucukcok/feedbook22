  <title>Finding Jim - Susan Oakey-Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finding Jim&lt;/i&gt; describes Susan Oakey-Baker’s struggle to confront the realities of life after the death of her husband, renowned mountain guide Jim Haberl, the first Canadian to summit the most difficult mountain in the world: K2. For fifteen years they had spent time adventuring together around the world: skiing the Himalaya, rafting in Nepal and mountaineering in North America. In time, they got married, solidified a home for themselves in Whistler, British Columbia, and planned on starting a family. But the future Susan had imagined was not meant to be, and when Jim was killed in an avalanche in the University Range of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park in Alaska, she was faced with a loss greater than anything she ever could have expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jim’s death, Susan spent time retracing the adventures they took together, in a desperate and obsessive attempt to gather and hold on to as many memories of him as she could. She travelled to the place in Alaska where he lost his life; searched the Queen Charlotte Islands where they had first met; trekked to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro where they had journeyed the year before his death; and scoured the hills around their Whistler home for traces of the man she had expected to spend the rest of her life with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of books like Joan Didion’s &lt;i&gt;The Year of Magical Thinking&lt;/i&gt; and Maria Coffey’s &lt;i&gt;Fragile Edge&lt;/i&gt;, Susan Oakey-Baker writes eloquently of her efforts to relive and reanalyze her husband&#39;s death, to defy the pain that such a loss causes and embrace the healing power of mountains, adventure and wilderness as she reimagines her new life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
