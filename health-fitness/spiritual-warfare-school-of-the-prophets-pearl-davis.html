  <title>Spiritual Warfare School of the Prophets - Pearl Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God is calling his church forth to take position as mighty warriors. We are chosen for battle and born to conquer. God has commanded his army to stand fast in the liberty by which Christ has made us free. We are not to be again entangled with a yoke of bondage. God has called you to the kingdom as such time as this to terrify the powers of darkness. We are ordered to go into the enemies camp the harvest is right. The trees are full, see them fall to the ground, they are being devour by the enemy. Where are the laborers? The harvest is ripe but the laborers are few. God has commanded us to go into the highways and compel men to come. Jesus said Son of man is come to seek and save that which was lost. Those who are well need not a physician but those who are sick. Jesus said to the father as you have sent me into the world I also have sent them into the world and have given them the authority to bind and loose on earth and in heaven. We are commanded to go into the enemy territory to bind the evil forces and loose souls into the kingdom of God. Jesus said Except a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things, that whatsoever I command you to teach them to become disciple of Christ. Unless a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God, unless he is born of the water and the Holy Spirit he shall not enter into the kingdom of God." />
