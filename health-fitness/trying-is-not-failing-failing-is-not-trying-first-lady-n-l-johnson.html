  <title>Trying is Not Failing Failing is Not Trying - First Lady  N.L Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;br /&gt; I just want to start by saying &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo;,&lt;br /&gt; for making the decision to pick up this book, open&lt;br /&gt; it, and read the contents. You have made a wise&lt;br /&gt; decision, not because I wrote this book, but if you&lt;br /&gt; have been reflecting on some areas of your life,&lt;br /&gt; you may be wondering where your life is going,&lt;br /&gt; what you actually want to do or stop doing, and&lt;br /&gt; how you want to move forward &amp;ndash; this book can&lt;br /&gt; really assist you.&lt;br /&gt; I want to encourage you today, by saying,&lt;br /&gt; try and read a chapter of this book a day along&lt;br /&gt; with the Bible, just to keep the momentum going.&lt;br /&gt; When reading this book keep an open mind&lt;br /&gt; and focus on what the words are saying to you as&lt;br /&gt; an individual. Most importantly do your best to act&lt;br /&gt; on this learning, as action is the best&lt;br /&gt; reinforcement of learning.&lt;br /&gt; Have you ever wondered what you would&lt;br /&gt; do if you knew you couldn&amp;rsquo;t fail? In this book we&lt;br /&gt; will examine the obstacles to success, and be&lt;br /&gt; careful to remain solution focused: on how we can&lt;br /&gt; overcome some of these barriers. We will also&lt;br /&gt; examine the importance of faith in God, as well as,&lt;br /&gt; the role of confidence and mindsets.&lt;br /&gt; Trying is Not Failing, Failing is Not Trying!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Finally, we will look at the need to make&lt;br /&gt; decisions versus procrastination. I hope that you&lt;br /&gt; will find chapter seven on: &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s stopping&lt;br /&gt; you?&amp;rdquo; a real motivation, as we learn together that:&lt;br /&gt; trying is not failing and failing is indeed not trying.&lt;br /&gt; You can&amp;rsquo;t succeed unless you try. Success will be&lt;br /&gt; forthcoming if you are determined, consistent and&lt;br /&gt; proactive. It will also come once you have made a&lt;br /&gt; decision to never give up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Food for thought:&lt;br /&gt; Procrastination is a killer of dreams, a robber of joy,&lt;br /&gt; a murderer of purpose, and can cause a life of&lt;br /&gt; missed opportunities. Be wise with your life and&lt;br /&gt; who you choose to spend your time with.&lt;/p&gt;" />
