  <title>THE JOURNEY OF THE BLIND ANGEL - Ana Rra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I, Jessie, must share with YOU what happened on this journey, THE JOURNEY OF THE BLIND ANGEL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came into my life overnight. Its thundering sound and strong moves were in deep contrast with my softness and silent wonder. It took possession of me, both my body and spirit, such that it could be seen as a Don Quixote&amp;rsquo;s adventure. Leaving no-connections but black ashes after eight days of sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, the exaltation happened during the nights. The EIGHT-DAYS&amp;rsquo; nights were perpetuated to weeks, months, and then years. These two lives, one lived by day and one by night, brought to me other faces that I did not know about others and myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happened despite the fact that I was reaching my fortieth birthday. Meaning that I had the wisdom of two-thirds of my life if I were to die at the same age as my mother did. It took me off guard. Now, I look back at it, almost amazed, feeling that the ashes are like seals on my pores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could not do much about it. At that moment I forgot all the wisdom about men I had acquired from the many MEN I had known as friends, as co-workers or in other common life relationships&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody had ever imagined that this kind of experience existed. It should be mentioned that at struggling moments, fearing for my life or others, I made a call to powerful people of today&amp;rsquo;s world and of other universes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Colombian-Canadian. My roots are from a farm family, and a Catholic-oriented culture in Colombia, where I lived my first decades. After that, more than a decade in Canada, an individual and multicultural environment. Without forgetting, that one is a developed country and the other is not. It was time to reconnect with my roots. Family Matters. From there, I will figure out my next step, I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the time I was eleven I wanted and had the conviction to be a professional (changing my mind from becoming a singer, doctor, marine engineer, but ended up as a computer science engineer). It sounded easy, a piece of cake. It was indeed nearly twenty years of struggle. The steady and overriding conviction suffered, more than once, from events that made it tremble. Lightning and sun-rays crashed against it, showing me that it could not happen. Still, thoughts of being famous and wealthy were always flashing in my sights, particularly the untested music idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the last minute, and forced by circumstance, I had decided to return to Canada to find my tenants. Yes, to search for the TENANTS. I had lived a short time with some of my siblings and their children. Feeling that I needed a longer time for sharing with them, as was my intention when I first left Canada. SHARING with my family. As important as this was, to escape from dollar-slavery, it was and is the uterus of human degradation. How to blame the homeless people?. In the developed country, I had rented out my apartment to be able to make the monthly mortgage payments. To do this, I had donated a lot things, clothing, and books, and threw away much of my other possessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I promised myself that I would never marry. I was fourteen at that time, and considering the idea that I also might not have children. I already had more nephews and nieces than I could visit and dedicate &amp;lsquo;quality time&amp;rsquo; to. I love children. Today, decades later, I notice how much I as a child knew about feelings. Feelings, which are beyond my control, one of them is called FALLING IN LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;
I resisted the temptation for many years, but I surrendered. So, I broke my promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in British Columbia, Canada&amp;#39;s third-largest province and most westerly. It bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west side. Rainfall is constantly present during autumn and winter. Cloudy-days are also present constantly in winter and spring. &amp;nbsp;Summer is covered by blue sky and sun rays. The population is over four million.&amp;nbsp;The aboriginal people struggle for survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
