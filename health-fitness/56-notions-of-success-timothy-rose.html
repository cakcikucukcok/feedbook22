  <title>56 Notions of Success - Timothy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Success is not becoming a superstar; that is fame. Success is fulfilling and exceeding your personal goals. 56 Notions of Success takes you across its magic compass pointing to results, thoughts, motivations, and actions.
Each point contains fourteen distinct notions of success. The fourteen notions for results confirm time-tested tools proven to gain success. The fourteen notions for thought draw from personal experiences of the authors own success. The fourteen notions for motivation will inspire you onto success through self-empowering principles. The book ends with fourteen notions for actions: practical tools for reaching your own success.
The inspiration to preserve these success notions is interwoven throughout the book. At the time of writing, the author conducted weekly workshops for independent agents setting up life insurance agencies. The book 56 Notions of Success preserves many of the key examples still being used in these workshops. It also contains minor secrets revealed through personal anecdotes." />
