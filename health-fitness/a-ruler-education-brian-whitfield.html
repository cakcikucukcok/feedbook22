  <title>A (Ruler) Education - Brian Whitfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brian Whitfield Jan , 07 , 2010 wrote a book of study in which virtuous lord is teacher and virtuous heir is student. Virtuous lord gives his example introduction and wisdom for the student to revise and apply his or her own preferred examples. This book is meant for the individual that loves to uphold peace and prosperity , but understands war and destruction as a means of survival. Generally for soldiers , officers , prestigious rulers , religious leaders , community leaders , and responsible guardians also. I pray this book helps you sustain , endure , and keeps you obedient to your respected superiors. Also I hope this book builds stronger character in you and stronger commitment to all which you value. 
                                                           Topic 26 : Treasure
I argue treasure is warriors , or that it is a ( Ruler ) most valued commodity esp. on battlegrounds. Virtuous Prince states warriors lead to treasure and treasure leads to warriors , and that it could break a rulers heart to be forced to leave treasure behind. Treasure rules everything around me , because treasure loves treasure. Treasure life , love , and happiness. Abusing treasure , or considered stealing without consent is folly concerning anothers treasure.
                                                          Topic 40 : Rest
I argue rest is peace , or that which keeps the territory comfortable. Virtuous Prince states where there is anger there is no rest , where there is no anger there is rest , where there is laughter there is no rest , and without work it is hard to rest. When no battles are going on learn your energy and reserve it as much as possible. To hate rest your more productive , full of energy , not tired , or that when you hate to rest your more considered a disturbance , in love with war , or blindly out looking for trouble? To love rest your fatigue and tired , or that when you rest your more at peace with your environment and reluctant to war ." />
