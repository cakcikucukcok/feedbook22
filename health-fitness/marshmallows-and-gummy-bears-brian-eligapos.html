  <title>Marshmallows and Gummy Bears - Brian Eligapos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book started out as a way for me to get self-help. Call it therapeutic if you will. The events expressed throughout the book are based on a true story. As I wrote down notes and started a running story line, I started to realize I cant be the only parent out there that has experienced the types of events that I have gone through along the way. Having said that, I strongly believe that if it has helped me, it would prove to be beneficial to others who are in a similar situation. It doesnt even have to be the struggles associated with mental illness. However, if its a circumstance that finds you in the position of being a single parent, you will be okay. Statistics show, youre not alone. Its not easy, but the fact that youre hanging in there and doing the best that you can is extremely important. The love that you have demonstrated towards your kids and the love they have for you will be the greatest reward that youll ever need." />
