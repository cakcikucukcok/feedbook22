  <title>An Absorbing Errand: How Artists and Craftsmen Make Their Way to Mastery - Janna Malamud Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;An Absorbing Errand&lt;/I&gt; uses stories of artists&amp;#8217; lives, personal anecdotes, and insights from the author&amp;#8217;s work as a psychotherapist to examine the psychological obstacles that prevent people from staying with, and relishing, the process of art-making.  Each chapter is devoted to a problem intrinsic to the creative process and illustrates how these very obstacles, once understood, can become prime sources of the energy that actually fuels the mastery of art-making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ultimately, &lt;I&gt;An Absorbing Errand&lt;/I&gt; provides a philosophical, historical, and analytical look at the creative impulse and how certain artists from a wide field mastered their craft. From Julia Child to Charlie Chaplin, Lady Gaga to Michael Jackson, famous painters to established writers, Smith shows us how each overcame the obstacles they faced in the pursuit of their creative visions.&lt;BR&gt;Many people carry within their hearts an aching sense that they have something they want to express through art; or that they will not feel complete until they&amp;#8217;ve brought out some hidden part of themselves. Yet they cannot begin to do the work of bringing their creative idea into the world. Or, maybe they&amp;#8217;ve begun over and over, but they can&amp;#8217;t stay with their labor long enough to finish it. An Absorbing Errand is a supportive companion, an enlightened and compassionate ballast, a guide for anyone who has ever picked up a pencil to write, or a paint brush to paint, or any tool &amp;#151;from chisel to loom&amp;#151; to pursue any serious craft, and then put it down again frustrated, discouraged,  and unable to continue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;An Absorbing Errand&lt;/I&gt; is unlike any book about creating art of any kind, and aspiring and working artists alike will find it both original and invaluable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
