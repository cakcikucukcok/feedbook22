  <title>Remarkable Changes - Jane Seymour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this inspiring memoir, internationally beloved actress Jane Seymour shows how she has learned to embrace and learn from the many changes in her life &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now fifty, Jane Seymour&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;the eternally beautiful star of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and countless other television shows and films&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;is a living testament to the rewards of embracing midlife and its challenges eagerly and gracefully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Remarkable Changes&lt;/em&gt;, she leads the reader through the challenges of those years&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;from the physical changes that come with the territory to the emotional transformations that accompany this passage of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From understanding the stages of change, to making every moment significant, she helps us find the true value in our life transitions, from marriage and divorce to career changes to milestones in the lives of our parents and children. Whether we initiate change in our life or it is thrust upon us by circumstances beyond our control, Jane shows that we should stop coping with change and start actively incorporating it into our lives, using the hard&amp;#8211;won wisdom we? all gained through the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Holding up as an example her own life and the lives of those closest to her, Seymour empowers us to accept life shifts and teaches us how to take even the toughest situations and turn them into strengthening tools. She talks about her own experiences with divorce and remarriage, children and stepchildren, and her new twin boys, and she describes her indomitable mother&#39;s difficult years in a World War II prison camp in Indonesia. Her best friend faced her own challenges when learning to understand her son&#39;s mental illness, and another friend started a grief recovery organization when his wife and son were murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We all need to face the beginnings and endings that make up our constantly changing lives. And this warm, inspiring book shows that we can all learn how to make each change remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
