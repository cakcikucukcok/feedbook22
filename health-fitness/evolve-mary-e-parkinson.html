  <title>Evolve - Mary E Parkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do we evolve our legacy of eating? How do we make better choices to create a better legacy for our children? How did America&amp;rsquo;s health care arrive in the state of crisis that we are in today and how do we eat our way out? We should not need a degree in chemistry, biology, nutrition nor medicine to comprehend what we should be eating. We need simple terms and logic of what to eat and why. Each of us is in a state of continual transformation and &lt;em&gt;Evolve&lt;/em&gt; will challenge your legacy of nutrition, your concepts of prevention and provide a simplistic framework for the evolution of your eating. We each make one choice at a time and with each choice, we choose our path of evolution. In this awakening, comprehensively researched and well-reasoned book, the author considers the nutritional choices that we make through personal stories, lessons learned in history, and factual data. Bringing the larger topic of the health care crisis to a personal level, the author conveys perspectives and potential solutions to the oversaturation of medication, the undernourishment of Americans, the proliferation of disease and the evolution of our health. Readers will not only feel thoroughly engaged, but also will be inspired to eat better and to leave a healthier legacy for their children and the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
