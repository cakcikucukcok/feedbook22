  <title>Wage War on Your Mind &amp; Fight for Your Life! - Meadows Niki, Muserelli Eva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After overcoming a long battle with depression, Niki Meadows was inspired to share how she did it. In this book, Meadows provides readers with a blueprint they can customize to build a life they love. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a quick fix in fact, it took Meadows two years to complete the process detailed. At the time it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a process at all, Meadows was just trying to do everything she could to overcome depression. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until several years later that she was able to identify the key steps she took to climb out of rock bottom. If this can better equip one person to fight their battle, it&amp;rsquo;s completed its intention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Having overcome depression, healed the relationship with herself, and continually cultivate her self-love, Meadows now works with women as a Worthiness and Authenticity Coach to help them do the same. Today, people that meet her can&amp;rsquo;t believe she fought such a hard battle with depression in the past. Meadows is very open about her struggle and seeks to encourage and empower those looking for support to conquer their own battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Whether this is the book for you or not, I encourage you to seek the path that best supports you on your journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.&amp;rdquo; -A.A. Milne&lt;/p&gt;" />
