  <title>Your High-Risk Pregnancy - Diana M. Raab, Errol Norwitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;This useful book gives sound, straightforward advice about prenatal care, analyzing and diagnosing high-risk factors, and describing the tests, medications, and procedures necessary for a healthy pregnancy. The authors offer specific ways to cope with the rollercoaster of emotions and medical issues that arise during this process. Beginning with a general guide to successful conception, the book explains the risks and addresses the most pressing concerns. Throughout the text, the authors check in with the men and women involved, showing them how to explore their feelings about the pregnancy, their emotions toward the baby, and how to build a solid support system. Each chapter contains journaling exercises, which are extremely important given the amount of bed-rest required in difficult pregnancies. Here too are informed discussions of natural birth versus C-section, the use of antibiotics and painkillers, and how to cope with miscarriages and premies. &lt;I&gt;Your High-Risk Pregnancy&lt;/I&gt; is a complete, caring companion during pregnancy and beyond.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
