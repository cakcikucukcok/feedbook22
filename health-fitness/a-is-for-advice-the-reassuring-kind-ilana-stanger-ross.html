  <title>A Is for Advice (The Reassuring Kind) - Ilana Stanger-Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Practical, reassuring, and beautifully written, &lt;em&gt;A is for Advice &lt;/em&gt;provides a brief and compelling reflection on pregnancy, birth, and the early postpartum period for expectant mothers of all kinds--whether you prefer a water birth at&amp;#160;home&amp;#160;or a scheduled C-section in a hospital, whether you believe in painkillers or an all-natural labor, breast milk or formula, this book speaks to you and your pregancy. Written in the approachable and friendly tone of a best-friend blogger but informed by the insight of a Registered Midwife, &lt;em&gt;A is for Advice &lt;/em&gt;seeks to comfort and inspire, providing realistic and soothing advice at a time when most women desperately seek out information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through 26 lesson/letters of the alphabet (C is for Control; F is for Fear; W is for Water), &lt;em&gt;A is for Advice &lt;/em&gt;offers practical and emotional insights into the often overwhelming transition to motherhood. Using a combination of humor, story-telling, research distillation, and personal reflection, &lt;em&gt;A is for Advice &lt;/em&gt;speaks to concerns common to all women as they approach birth and motherhood. Eschewing the &amp;#8220;birth wars&amp;#8221; for a women-centered, feminist perspective, &lt;em&gt;A is for Advice &lt;/em&gt;does not argue for any one type of birth experience, but rather empowers each woman to be her own advocate.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If the book could be summed up in one line it would be, simply, &amp;#8220;be gentle with yourself.&amp;#8221;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160; &lt;/strong&gt;Read it cover-to-cover or in the short bursts available to an expecting mom (each letter stands alone), this book offers a compelling call for well-informed, judgment-free, and forgiving birthing and mothering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small gifty package with a beautful black-and-white illustration program by Iris Gottlieb, this is the ultimate babyshower gift for your best friend, sister, or daughter. &lt;/p&gt;" />
