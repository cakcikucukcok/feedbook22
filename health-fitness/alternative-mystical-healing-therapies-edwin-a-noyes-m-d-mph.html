  <title>Alternative &amp; Mystical Healing Therapies - Edwin A. Noyes M.D. Mph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The lies told in the Garden, you shall not die and you will become wise like God, (become a god), are the foundational pillars of paganism/nature worship.  From these religions many proclaimed healing methods which are not based on known science have evolved.  They are a component of pagan spirituality, not some healing modality accidently discovered.   Such healing practices are the right arm for evangelism in the Neo-PaganNew Age movement.
The devil, by deception, offers his counterfeit system of healing to entice man to give him the honor and worship due only to Jesus Christ the Divine Son of God.  Many are deceived into believing that there is no spiritual danger in partaking of these proclaimed healing practices   
This book exposes the terrible spiritual dangers posed by the New Age holistic health movement, which combines valid healing remedies with various mystical healing arts.  Valuable insights are given herein into the traps of the paranormal from a Christian perspective.  Today there many who are more interested in health at any cost than Gods will at any price." />
