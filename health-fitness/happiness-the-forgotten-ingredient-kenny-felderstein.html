  <title>Happiness the Forgotten Ingredient - Kenny Felderstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kenny Felderstein truly believes &lt;b&gt;Happiness Is The Forgotten Ingredient&lt;/b&gt; in life. He is dedicated to assisting the reader of this book in taking charge of their career and their life and finding the happiness they deserve.  He is not a doctor or therapist.  The information he gives the reader comes from many years of executive management in business and personal life experiences - not just from books. He has come from meager roots to achieve Vice President and President level positions in both small and very large corporations.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;He has changed careers and taken demotions for the sole purpose of enhancing his happiness.  He has made changes and taken risks for happiness, not for money, power or ego. He has overcome divorce, family tragedy, the loss of a son, near financial bankruptcy, never feeling good enough, never feeling he had control of his happiness and nonproductive anger and frustration.  By overcoming these difficult times, Kenny has created a rewarding and happy life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny Felderstein began blogging on the subject of Happiness because he realized he could reach a large multinational audience.  He has a dedicated following in over nine countries.  He has received feedback from his readers that his blogs have made a difference in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is done in blog format.  There are one hundred blogs - each standing on their own merits.  All of his blogs are from personal experiences in his life.  Some are funny.  Some are serious.  Some are emotional.  However, all of them will help the readers realize that they have control of their happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny Felderstein has published three successful books entitled Never Buy a Hat if Your Feet Are Cold  Taking Charge of Your Career and Your Life, The Year of My Death and &quot;A True Leader Has Presence - The Six Building Blocks To Presence.&quot;  He lectures to and mentors people on the reasons people dont take charge of their careers and their happiness.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Kenny Felderstein is a graduate of Saint Josephs University in Pennsylvania and currently lives in Marina Del Rey, California with his beautiful wife Ellen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
