&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is more to life than you are currently experiencing. Turn off the TV, put down the Cheese Doodles, and pick up &lt;i&gt;Choosing Your Power &lt;/i&gt;(you might want to wipe the Cheese Doodle dust off your hands first). Dr. P. explains how to give yourself permission to feel good about yourself, your life, and where youre headed in it.
