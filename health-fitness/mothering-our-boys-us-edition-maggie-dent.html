  <title>Mothering Our Boys (US Edition) - Maggie Dent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Maggie is earthy and real, full of love and knowledge, especially on raising sons.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; - Steve Biddulph&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Maggie&#39;s perspective on raising boys is spot on. She writes with humor and depth, providing insight and strategies for many of the most important issues facing moms. There is a lovely ease to her writing and a powerful honesty. I hope every mother of a son (and everyone else!) will read this book. The future of the world, to a great extent, depends on how we raise our boys.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; - Michael Gurian, New York Times Bestselling Author of The Wonder of Boys and Saving Our Sons&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If we can see the world through boys&#39; eyes a little better, we will make different choices in the way we mother them… and we will find them less confusing, and love them more deeply.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mothers of sons are worried about raising their boys in a world where negative images of masculinity are front and centre of our media, almost every day. Not only that, but statistically our boys are still struggling in many ways.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though we live in a time where we recognise that nothing in gender is fixed, it remains a fact that the influence of a mother on her son is massive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A mother of four sons herself, Maggie Dent draws on her personal experience - and over four decades work as a teacher, counsellor and now author and speaker - to help build understanding, empathy and compassion for our boys.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maggie shares her five key secrets that every mum needs to know and uses the voices of men she has worked with and surveyed to reveal what really matters in a boy&#39;s relationship with his mother and other mother figures.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maggie is one of Australia&#39;s most popular parenting authors and educators, and her seminars about boys have sold out all across Australia and in the UK. She is finally sharing her insights, her reflections, and (as always) her humour around mothering boys to help you be the mum your son needs you to be." />
