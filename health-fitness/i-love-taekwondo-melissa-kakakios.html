      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sam is a little boy who loves and practices the martial art and Olympic sport of taekwondo. Although he lives out in the bush, this doesnt stop him from believing that one day he will be a champion. He imagines himself at the Olympics one day, but first he has many lessons to learn. Taekwondo provides Sam with opportunities to challenge his mind and develop his skills. The attributes of courage, courtesy, honesty, perseverance and self-controlwhich are embedded in taekwondohave to be learned, practised and experienced time and time again in order for him to become a true champion in life. Sam keeps his dream alive by fuelling his love of taekwondo with hard work, positive thoughts and unwavering faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the problems some children experience with bullying, inactivity, obesity and low self-esteem, I Love Taekwondo encourages children to respect themselves and others, dare to dream big and live happy, healthy and active lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Love Taekwondo is the first book in a series that seeks to help transform childrens characters, introduce principles of self-discipline and improve self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
