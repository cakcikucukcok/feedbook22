  <title>Growing up Under the Palm Trees - Emmerson Philippe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing Up under the Palm Trees is about a young Haitian American&#39;s journey advancing through the rough streets of Little Haiti, Miami, Florida during the late 80s to the early parts of the 21st Century. His account starts with his exit out of Haiti amidst a brutal revolution in which he and his family barely escaped with their lives. Upon arriving in Miami, they found another group of challenges in which each member had to acquire skills that would allow him or her to properly assimilate into American life. During those early years, his inability to properly communicate with others led him on a more introverted path that both helped him academically but would later hinder him socially when he entered school. 
Upon entering school, he found much success in the classroom, but still was a social deviant in terms of him making friends and growing beyond the classroom. Although he made great strides coming out of elementary school, middle school seemed to have been a much different challenge that would test his resolve as a student, and allow him to delve deep and find a connection with his past and heritage. High school proved to be a dangerous place for him, but it was there that he experienced the most success and experience love and heartbreak for the first time while graduating a year early. This success translated into him getting accepted into college at a local university and him getting significantly involved in every facet of college life.  
	After one of his professor&#39;s death, he decided to once again graduate early and face the working world. It was during this time that he experienced yet another set of challenges including the death of one of his half-brothers, unemployment, debilitating health, and career exploration." />
