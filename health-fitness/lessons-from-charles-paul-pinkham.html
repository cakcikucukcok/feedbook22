  <title>Lessons from Charles - Paul Pinkham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alone, depressed, hopeless, and unwantedthese were the emotions that defined me in the aftermath of divorce and death that had turned my world upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then into my life bounced an abandoned little puppy, rescued from the shoulder of a busy interstate highway, where he had been thrown from a car. He looked like I felt: discarded and beat up by life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from the moment he bounded through my front door, Charles began teaching me valuable lessons about life, recovery, and finding joy again. From his story, I began writing a new chapter of my own life, one of hope and restoration, healing and forgiveness, love and kindness. His lessons continued as new love bloomed and blossomed, and his story became our story. It is my hope that what Charles taught us will resonate with you, no matter where you are in this crazy journey we call life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
