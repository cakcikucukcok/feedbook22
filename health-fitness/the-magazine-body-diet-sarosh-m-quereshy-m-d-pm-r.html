  <title>The Magazine Body Diet - Sarosh M. Quereshy M.D. Pm&amp;R</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Sarosh Quereshy is a sports medicine physician who received his training from the prestigious Cornell Medical Center in New York City. He has used his medical background in this specialized field, in addition to over two years of extensive current research to devise The Magazine Body Diet and Q-Force Exercise Regimen.
Both of these programs for healthy living apply across the board to all ages, health/physical conditions, and fitness levels. Dr. Q&#39;s comprehensive well-being plan boasts a ZERO PERCENT FAILURE RATE because it is simple and flexible enough to follow for the rest of your life. This amazing program requires LITTLE or NO EXERCISE and NO STARVATION. 
Devotees of Dr. Q&#39;s Plan enjoy its many side-effects: improved appearance (a lean, strong, sexy body) and multiple health benefits (lower cholesterol, improved liver function, decreased blood pressure, better blood sugar control and improved sleep function, to name a few).
Maybe your doctor has recommended that you lose weight for health reasons or you have an upcoming photo-shoot? Perhaps you want to lose your man-boobs, muffin-top or that last ten pounds of post-baby weight? The Magazine Body Diet is a plan that produces permanent results, quickly and efficiently.  You do not have to go on any kind of an extreme diet or push yourself to physical exhaustion at the gym 5 to 6 days a week for hours on end. Simply, take the first step and let this informative guide lead you to a leaner, stronger, healthier, sexier YOU!!!" />
