  <title>Life on Mitchell Road - Cynthia Burse Brandon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;In my emotional but serious short story, Life On Mitchell Road, there are trouble teens who feel unloved, unworthy, unwanted, unfit and unneccessary. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Freeman is a quiet but somewhat lost and impressionable young man who&#39;s crying out for some acceptance among his peers. He meets William a young man with the same problems but a disturbed mind. They&#39;ve tried to fit in but found the world to be much to cruel. And no matter who they turn to for help they get slapped in the face. Now William has devised a plan to see that no one ever disrespects them again.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Freeman&#39;s fought a long battle for social acceptance andsocial freedom. And still he runs into one brick wall after another. Thanks to his new friend Wiilliam, Freeman feels his fight will soon be over. Quiet young people are usually teased and bullied to the point of embarrassment. They are outcast and rarely show any emotion.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;These young teens just need to be accepted. Like anyone else they need someone to talk to. Or the pain, the rejection and the embarrassment will eat them up inside like cancer. And sooner or later this will mentally take its toll, and eventually they will explode.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Today is the day to take final exams. The underclassmen have two weeks left in school. But this is the senior&#39;s last day of classand no one was prepared for what was about to happen. No one knew who, what, when or why. All they knew was something had happened at Mitchell Road School.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Life On Mitchell Road relates to our troubled teens and their struggle thru everyday living.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Freeman realizes that two wrongs don&#39;t make a right. And just because he&#39;s hurting doesn&#39;t nean he&#39;s lost out on life. He virtually becomes the hero.&lt;/P&gt;" />
