  <title>The Scoop on Poop - Anne Ferguson Bm, Mike Cope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Finally ! A straight forward, easy-to-read, entertaining guide to good digestive health. With the assistance of Scoop The Poop, intrepid reporter, this empowering bathroom book will help you make a perfect poo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the perfect poo made of? What are the ingredients to a perfect poo?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Learn the four major building blocks to a perfect poo and how they can make a perfect you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when you dont poo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how failure to eliminate waste is like a garbage strike in the dead of summer. All that trash just sits and swelters on the 98-degree sidewalk. As it rots, ammonia gas builds up, emitting foul odors.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;How do you make a perfect poo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn the secrets to making a perfect poo. Its not as hard as you think, and you should be making peerless poos in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anne Ferguson takes the reader on a comprehensive, stepwise journey to proper digestion, explaining the importance of proper elimination. This book puts focus on the principle of  what goes in must, come out and its relationship to a healthy, functioning body which is the mainstay of a naturopathic approach and disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scoop on Poop, is a great addition to any health-minded household or individual who has an interest in knowing the scoop on proper elimination and how it reflects on our health from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michelle J. Salga, ND (Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine), IVT (Intravenous Vitamin Therapy Practitioner), BHRT (Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapy Practitioner)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a fabulous mix of health knowledge, digestive insight and Annes humour! Everyone should take some time to read this fun, simple and educational tool on healthy digestion! I just love it! &lt;/p&gt;
