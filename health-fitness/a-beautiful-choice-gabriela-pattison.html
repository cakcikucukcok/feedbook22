  <title>A Beautiful Choice - Gabriela Pattison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a parent, when our child gets diagnosed with an illness, we turn to the child within us for help without realizing or recognizing it. What we are really trying to accomplish is to find answers to guide ourselves and our children through the journey of a life-threatening illness. 
A Beautiful Choice provides you with the necessary recognitions, tools, and guidance to find your way during these challenging times. It compassionately shows you the road through self discovery, and starts to open your mind to a new way of life.
Life where you recognize the power within you, find courage to take actions and live life fully in the present moment with all your imperfections, incomplete information as well as with what might seem as unorganized order of events." />
