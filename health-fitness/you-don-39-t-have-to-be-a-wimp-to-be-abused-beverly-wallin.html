  <title>You Don&#39;t Have to Be a Wimp to Be Abused - Beverly Wallin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jane, is a composite character of many women, some fictional and some similar to true life. She is beautiful, strong-willed, intelligent and athletic. No one would suspect that shes a victim of Domestic Violence against Women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane encompasses the types of domestic abuse women suffer. She is brainwashed to be a people pleaser. She represses her true feelings to survive her home and school life. Jane must appear positive and happy to avoid punishment. She is disempowered to assert herself. To avoid the disappointment of her parents Jane lies and steals to get her wants and dreams met. She is screaming inside with her need to be loved unconditionally. Jane rebels by detaching from herself. Her unrealistic world view causes her to be co-dependent, vulnerable and nave, a walking target for domestic abuse against women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end she is empowered to finally get free and to heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for You Dont have to be a Wimp to be Abused (for Women)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallin crafts a brilliant, insightful work. Readers will learn practical ways to deal with their issues. You wont be able to put this book down even if you dont identify with Jane. The Quick Reference Guide really nails the issues. ~ Marlene Worrell, novelist and screenwriter; latest release is Angel in Shining Armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interesting and informative. I like the idea of using a fictional character narrative to explore the various issues surrounding domestic abuse. The technique works well and is preferable to the more traditional methods. ~ Laurence French&lt;/p&gt;" />
