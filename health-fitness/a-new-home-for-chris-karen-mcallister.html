Chris is filled with excitement as he starts his journey, but when he arrives in the big city, he sees things he has never seen before. He is met by his new family, who are strangers, and his excitement soon turns to fear. Will he like his new home and his new family? Will anything ever be familiar again? As the story develops, Chris makes a new best friend, Bonnie, a big brown-and-orange-striped cat, and he grows to love his new home, his new family, and his new best friend." />
