  <title>I Live, You Move On - Lendy E. Demetrius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How does an upwardly-mobile woman of color find the balance between her career, love life and friendships in modern day Manhattan? Man-eater Julissa Longoriez and betrayed wife and mother Nahla Voyas are on a quest to find out just that in I Live, You Move On.
 Between her ambition and her passion, Julissa Longoriez has more on her plate at this point in her life than she ever expected. The quintessential sexy, sultry Latina, she hides behind a faade of detachment to avoid commitment. But when she meets the first man to get past her cool, unaffected career woman veneer, Julissa must admit to herself that what she truly fears is honesty about her past. Will opening up about her secrets open her heart and set Julissa free? Or will it destroy her once chance at love and the man willing to offer it?
After sacrificing her dreams to build the perfect marriage and family, Nahla Voyas is facing a truth she can no longer ignore: her husband has never been as devoted to their life together as she is. As she works to redefine herself as the ultimate role model of sister girl strength for her daughter  - tackling a list of dreams and goals deferred for too long  - a tragic accident threatens to keep her trapped in a loveless marriage. Can Nahla look past her husband&#39;s past indiscretions and find in this tragic turn of events a second chance at marital bliss? Or will she finally learn to love herself more than him for the sake of their child?
I Live, You Move On uniquely offers each woman&#39;s response to life&#39;s challenges, weaving a modern urban fairy tale from their successes and losses, laughter and tears." />
