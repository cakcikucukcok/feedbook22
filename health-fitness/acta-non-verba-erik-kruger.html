  <title>Acta Non Verba - Erik Kruger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do you achieve great things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you create unstoppable momentum in your life and business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ERIK KRUGER is a high-performance coach and founder of the Mental Performance Lab. He writes an email early each morning which he sends to many thousands of subscribers. The aim of his daily message is to inspire people, asking them to reflect and act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with more than 160 thoughtful reflections on what it takes to live a life of action and not words, Acta Non Verba’s purpose is to get people moving, creating, and generating an unstoppable drive in both their business and personal journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The words Acta Non Verba is the sign-off Erik uses in all his emails. This simple Latin phrase, meaning ‘Actions Not Words’, has started a movement. It’s a plea; a call to create your life instead of living it by default, a call to show your intentions instead of merely speaking about them. It’s a call to live to your fullest potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a book to read from cover to cover, in one sitting. Each day there is a new chapter waiting to be read. Put your e.reader on your bedside table, and read a new chapter with your first cup of coffee every morning. Each message is short so you can read it quickly, in the moment, and then reflect and act on it for the entire day. It’s a book that demands action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACTIONS, NOT WORDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, it’s not about the words on these pages; it’s about what you do with them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
