  <title>Mastering Motivation: Motivating Yourself and Others With NLP - Damian Inc. Hamill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Conventionally motivation is thought of as something that is created by exciting pep talks or by the promise of material rewards. More recent research suggests, however, that such approaches may have the opposite effect of what was intended and that there is no &amp;quot;one size fits all&amp;quot; approach to motivation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this eBook, Damian Hamill takes an NLP systemic approach to motivation and presents a model that suggests motivation emerges when we are aligned with whatever it is we are seeking to achieve. A lack of motivation, he suggests, may be a very useful way of communicating that what we are planning to do conflicts with something that is important to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damian guides the listener through a process to explore, appreciate, and, if appropriate, resolve such conflicts, enabling a greater degree of motivation to naturally evolve as a result." />
