  <title>What&#39;s In It For Me?: Know the nutritional value of the fruit you eat. - Wyatt Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone knows that fruits are some of the healthiest foods you can eat. But have you ever stood in the produce section of a grocery store or walked the aisles of a Farmers&#39; Market and wondered just what vitamins and minerals were in the different varieties of fruit on display? Which fruits are highest in vitamin C, or vitamin E, phosphorus or potassium? You may have read labels and tables of vitamins and then can&#39;t remember or know how to apply the information you read. &quot;What&#39;s In It For Me?&quot; removes the confusion of the numbers and information and presents practical information that is easy to understand. And because of the format of the presentation, the information is also easier to remember." />
