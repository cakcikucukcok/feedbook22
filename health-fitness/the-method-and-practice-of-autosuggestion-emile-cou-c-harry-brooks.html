  <title>The Method and Practice of Autosuggestion - Emile Coué, C. Harry Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two Classics in One:
Self-Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion by Emile Coué
PLUS The Practice of Autosuggestion by C. Harry Brooks
Self-Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion.
Coué’s method of autosuggestion is better known today as affirmation. It focuses on a routine repetition of this particular expression according to a specified ritual, in a given physical state, and in the absence of any sort of allied mental imagery, at the beginning and at the end of each day.
Self-Mastery fully details his method and explains how the concept of auto-suggestion works to bring about a desired circumstance. Although stressing that he was not primarily a healer but one who taught others to heal themselves, Coué claimed to have effected organic changes through autosuggestion.
“A work of real and unique value.”
The Practice of Autosuggestion by the Method of Emile Coué, by C. Harry Brooks
From the Foreword: “The method of M. Coué is in no sense opposed to the ordinary practice of medicine. It is not intended to supplant it but to supplement it. It is a new ally, bringing valuable reinforcements to the common crusade against disease and unhappiness.
Induced Autosuggestion does not involve, as several hasty critics have assumed, an attack upon the Will. It simply teaches that during the actual formulation of suggestions, that is for a few minutes daily, the Will should be quiescent. At other times the exercise of the Will is encouraged; indeed we are shown how to use it properly, that is without friction or waste of energy.”" />
