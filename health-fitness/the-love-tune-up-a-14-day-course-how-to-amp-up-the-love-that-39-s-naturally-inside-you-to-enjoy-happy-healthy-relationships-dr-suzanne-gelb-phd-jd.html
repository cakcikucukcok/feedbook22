  <title>The Love Tune-Up: A 14-Day Course. How to Amp Up the Love That&#39;s Naturally Inside You to Enjoy Happy, Healthy Relationships - Dr. Suzanne Gelb PhD Jd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;What if instead of attracting people who don&amp;rsquo;t respect me, I could meet&amp;hellip; the love of my life?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if instead of blowing up whenever my partner annoys me, I could respond with&amp;hellip; patience?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if instead of feeling an increasingly vast distance between us, with less intimacy and sex&amp;hellip; each year brought us closer together?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are important questions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Questions that Dr. Suzanne Gelb PhD, JD has been exploring in her work with men, women and couples &amp;mdash; in her counseling and coaching practice &amp;mdash; for over 30 years, combined.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The answer to every question is &lt;b&gt;Love&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And when Dr. Gelb says, &amp;ldquo;Love is the answer,&amp;rdquo; she&amp;#39;s not trying to be poetic. It&amp;rsquo;s actually very practical.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you know how to treat yourself with love, care and respect, then you tend to attract people who (also) want to treat you with love, care and respect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you are living a happy, healthy life, then you (naturally) form happy, healthy relationships with others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, of course, romantic partnerships involve two people &amp;mdash; not just one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if things are feeling rocky or difficult, or not flowing in the way that you&amp;rsquo;d like, the first relationship to explore and upgrade is your relationship with yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Love Tune-Up &lt;/i&gt;is an invitation to do&amp;hellip; exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With this 14-day course, you&amp;rsquo;ll receive short lessons (plus a few more surprises!) to help you tune-up and upgrade your relationship with yourself. How you talk to yourself &amp;mdash; and how you treat yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons to help you move back into your natural, unburdened state of being &amp;mdash; free of guilt, shame or unresolved anger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons on moving back home&amp;hellip; into Love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re currently single, dating or in a relationship &amp;mdash; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Love Tune-Up &lt;/i&gt;is designed to help you create a happier, more loving relationship with yourself, regardless of your current coupledom-status. It&amp;rsquo;s always the right time&amp;hellip; for more Love!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The basic details:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Love Tune-Up&lt;/i&gt; is 14 days long.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You have access to a new lesson for each day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can go at your own pace and there is no expiration date.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a written version (paperback or digital) and in the future, there will be an audio version of each lesson. So you can read or listen. Whatever you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can start &lt;i&gt;The Love Tune-Up&lt;/i&gt; at any time. But&amp;hellip; why not now?&lt;b&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s always the right time to choose Love.&lt;/b&gt;" />
