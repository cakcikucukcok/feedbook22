      <meta name="description" content="Isaiah 61 
The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captive and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lords favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zionto bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness Instead of mourning and a garment of praise Instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called the oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display of his splendor. They will rebuild an ancient ruin and restore the places long devastated they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations. Aliens will Shepard your flocks; foreigners will work your field and vineyards. And you will be called priests of the Lord, you will be named ministers of our God you will feed on the wealth of nations, and in their riches you will boast." />
