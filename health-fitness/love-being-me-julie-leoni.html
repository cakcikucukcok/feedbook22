  <title>Love Being Me - Julie Leoni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Read this book amidst the laundry, the dishes and the school runs, to move from stress to ease, in simple and heart-felt ways.  Love Being Me is a warm and personal book which shares one woman&#39;s search for meaning and peace in her life after divorce. Julie draws on her knowledge and experience of psychotherapy and meditation and finds ways to put what she knows, into practice, whilst doing the dishes and taking the kids to school.  She writes friend-to-friend, with anecdotes and admissions of failure, flaws, joy and love. She asks questions, offers exercises and invites every one of us to live our lives from the heart, so that we can say &#39;I love being me&#39;, no matter what life brings.  &#39;This book is a wonderfully contemporary restatement of ancient wisdom. It&#39;s profound, funny and at times courageously self-revelatory. Anyone looking to further their life should read it&#39;. Michael Sclater, Psychotherapist" />
