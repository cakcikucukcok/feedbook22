  <title>The Passion Generation - Grant Skeldon, Ryan Casey Waller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Millennials have disrupted almost every major industry. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a parent trying to raise them, a pastor trying to reach them, or an employer trying to retain them, they&amp;rsquo;re disruptive. As the largest living generation, millennials are one of the most studied but misunderstood groups of our day. And the chasm between the generations is only getting wider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaker and founder of the Initiative Network Grant Skeldon pulls back the confusing statistics about millennials to reveal the root issue: it&amp;rsquo;s not a millennial problem, it&amp;rsquo;s a discipleship problem. Millennials are known for their struggle to hold jobs, reluctance to live on their own, and alarming migration away from the church. And now our culture is feeling the results of a mentor-less, fatherless generation. But how do you start discipling young people when you struggle to connect with them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by a millennial, &lt;em&gt;The Passion Generation &lt;/em&gt;will guide you beyond the stats of what millennials are doing to the &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;they&amp;rsquo;re doing it and &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;we can all move toward healthy community. With wit, compassion, and startling insights, this book shares stories and studies drawn from Skeldon&amp;rsquo;s years of working to bridge generational gaps. In his signature conversational style, Skeldon offers researched strategies that will spark healthy connections, and practical methods that will help you disciple the millennials you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is your guide to understanding the millennials in your life who are seemingly reckless but far from hopeless, for the future of the church that depends on them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
