  <title>A Successful Senior Year Job Search Begins in the Freshman Year - Bob Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All college students would like to graduate with good jobs in their fields of interest, jobs that pay well and effectively launch their careers with desirable employers. This book shows students how to achieve their employment goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The What - What exactly can be done to ensure employment success?&lt;br /&gt;The How - How are the steps, actions and results achieved?&lt;br /&gt;The Why - Why are these steps, actions and results necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most good jobs, grades alone are no longer enough. The best employers want students to demonstrate their capabilities in an array of environments and situations. Therefore, knowing what to do is important. However, students also need a system that lays out the steps that can be followed during each semester of college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When students perform the activities and produce the results that employers need, want, and expect of the best candidates, their employment possibilities will improve dramatically. That is what this book is all about. It will enable more students to compete effectively in the job market.&lt;/p&gt;" />
