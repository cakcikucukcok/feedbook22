Chen, David Tabatsky</i></b> | RX for Hope provides a thorough insight into the aspects of oncology that are often neglected by the modern cancer care establishment despite being instrumental and often successful tools for a segment of cancer patients who havenâ€™t been willing to accept the bleak prognosis offered to them. From emphasis on how chemotherapy administration schedule may affect patient outcomes to a broader attention to the effects that one's own immune system has in controlling cancer, this book makes sense ...<br /><b><i>Rx for Hope: An Integrative Approach to Cancer Care ...</i></b> | RX for Hope is a book that is long overdue! It provides a rational basis for an enlightened approach to cancer that honors science, nature, the patient, and last, but not least, the physicianâ€™s code to use all rational means to promote health, and alleviate unnecessary suffering. -- Mark Gignac, ND, FABNO<br /><b><i>Rx for Hope: An Integrative Approach to Cancer Care ...</i></b> | Chen and Tabatsky have provided us with an insightful treatment roadmap for patients who have been diagnosed with cancer. Chenâ€™s results should give patients and clinicians pause and reason to review his methodology. Using the newest and best version of chemotherapy delivery, RX for Hope gives patients more hope for better outcomes.
