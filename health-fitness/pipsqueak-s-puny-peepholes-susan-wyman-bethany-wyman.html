  <title>Pipsqueak’S Puny Peepholes - Susan Wyman, Bethany Wyman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pipsqueak is a little, handicapped mouse who lives in a pipe with holes that has a view of a garden, a tree and a knoll. His thoughtfulness and non-judgmental opinion of others makes a huge difference in the lives of his neighbors. As he strives to bring them beauty, joy, or to encourage the best in each character, they find greater happiness. He demonstrates the difference one caring individual can make in a community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sneak a peek in on how he ponders the needs of a little neighbor boy: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
On the east he saw a nearby hill &lt;br&gt;
With a little farm and a boy named Will, &lt;br&gt;
Who would often fume at the smallest matter, &lt;br&gt;
And would get irate at his sisters chatter. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Pipsqueak wondered why this boy &lt;br&gt;
Always seemed so glum, he had lost his joy. &lt;br&gt;
So he pensively pondered how he might &lt;br&gt;
Bring a tad of fun and a bit of delight &lt;br&gt;
To the grumpy lad with the scowl so sad.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
