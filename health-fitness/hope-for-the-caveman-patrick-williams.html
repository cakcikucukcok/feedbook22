  <title>Hope for the Caveman - Patrick Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Men throughout the United States and beyond have adopted a feminine perspective on what it means to be a man. Without realizing it, they have made a terrible mistake.
Instead of meeting women halfway, men have yielded their natural roles and are walking around emasculated. As a result, society has begun to break down, and men everywhere are hungry for the reemergence of an authentic masculinity.
This guidebook offers solutions so that men can learn who they are and cultivate their masculine identities. Important areas of research include
	differences between the male and female brains;
	case studies portraying why misunderstandings occur between the sexes;
	ways that men and women can best contribute to society;
	strategies to get to know yourself better as a man.
If you sense something is wrong with yourself or the men around you, then listen to your instincts. Take steps to fix your natural compass and help others find their way out of the wilderness. By embracing knowledge, there is still &lt;i&gt;Hope for the Caveman.&lt;/i&gt;" />
