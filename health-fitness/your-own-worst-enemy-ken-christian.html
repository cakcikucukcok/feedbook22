  <title>Your Own Worst Enemy - Ken Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you suffer from any of the following?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Procrastination &lt;li&gt;Wide swings of mood and self-esteem &lt;li&gt;Ambivalence in making decisions &lt;li&gt;Dreaming big, but never following through&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you love isn&#39;t living up to his or her potential -- and suffers from even one or two of the above feelings -- here is a program that can help. &lt;em&gt;Your Own Worst Enemy&lt;/em&gt; is the first book devoted to the problem of adult underachievement, a problem stemming from common behavior patterns that can manifest itself in almost every walk of life -- from twentysomethings stuck in dead-end jobs to outwardly successful businesspeople who can&#39;t help feeling they&#39;ve missed their true calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Your Own Worst Enemy,&lt;/em&gt; Dr. Kenneth Christian details the telltale signs of what he calls &lt;em&gt;self-limiting behavior&lt;/em&gt; -- everyday habits that can seem harless (like taking unchallenging jobs) or even worthwhile (like setting absurdly high standards), but that over time can send high-potential people into a tailspin of dead ends and frustration. He identifies underachieving types, from charmers, who substitute congeniality for effort, to extreme risk-takers, who casually gamble their future away, to best-or-nothings, who refuse to play if they can&#39;t win. And he offers practical 15-step guide to help underachievers shake off their old habits and start taking an active hand in their own future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with persuasive case studies and useful advice on everything from overhauling workspace to remaking self-image, &lt;em&gt;Your Own Worst Enemy&lt;/em&gt; will help underachievers everywhere visualize their goals, break through their barriers, and start realizing their unlimited potential.&lt;/p&gt;" />
