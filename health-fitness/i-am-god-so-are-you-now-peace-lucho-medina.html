  <title>I Am God. so Are You. Now, Peace. - Lucho Medina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you look at the world, it seems so vast yet complicated to understand. Its people, its forms of governments and its systems of governments. Its beliefs, forms of beliefs and systems of beliefs; all created by man and/or the rule of man over another man; when all we needed was to understand that there are no systems of government as there are no systems of beliefs without its people, as there are no rich corporations or anything else without its people. People are the most important element on this part of the universe, because nothing would matter if we did not exist, and because we exist everything matters, and because it matters the rule of man has been taking advantage of its people, because its people were too ignorant to understand those simple facts. All this has been going on for thousands of years and if we the people do not stop this ignorance, we will continue to live like this forever. Change the Charter of the United Nations; as soon as we change this, we can kill world hunger in three years and live in peace immediately. It is time for the people to understand knowledge, and with knowledge we can change all systems of beliefs as well as all systems of government. All you have to do is seek for knowledge, and with knowledge we can all conquer the universe, live forever, and live happily, rich and in peace. &lt;br /&gt;
