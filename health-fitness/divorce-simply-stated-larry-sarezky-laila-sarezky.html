      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive, easily understood divorce roadmap is supplemented with a veteran divorce attorney&amp;rsquo;s advice and rarely discussed strategies for working with and saving money on divorce lawyers, maximizing settlements, avoiding unnecessary battles over children, avoiding common mistakes, taking advantage of tax code benefits, and a host of other topics. Among many other things, readers will learn where to find the &amp;quot;Quality Divorce Lawyer Bargain Basement,&amp;quot; how to be proactive and save money by &amp;quot;being your own paralegal&amp;quot; and secrets of legal fee billing that can make a lawyer charging a higher hourly rate actually cost less than a colleague charging less per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;THIS BOOK IS A MASTERPIECE!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Only Larry Sarezky could have written a book that contains all the divorce essentials plus priceless strategies for success and savings that you won&amp;#39;t find anywhere else!&amp;quot; &lt;/em&gt;raves Joanie Winberg, CEO of the National Association of Divorce for Women and Children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;????&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Renowned for his compassionate work in the family law field, divorce lawyer/mediator Larry Sarezky explains all of the divorce basics in a bite-sized volume that soothes and even entertains as it educates.
