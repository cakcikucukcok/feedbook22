He has the uncanny knack of identifying our insecurities, helping us view them from a different angle and transforming them into foundation stones for building new confidence. Whether you want to learn to ‘talk like TED’, present your best side at a job interview, or simply want to stand out from the crowd – this new book offers simple, clear and practical guidance. Like his previous books, this is another example of why Dr Rob Yeung stands out from other psychologists and coaches.” &lt;b&gt;Malcolm Green, Creative Chairman at advertising agency Green Cave People&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
