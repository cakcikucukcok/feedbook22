  <title>My Baby &amp; Me - Sam Faiers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For Sam Faiers life as part of the TOWIE cast, living it up Essex style, partying the night away is a distant memory but she wouldn&#39;t change it for the world. Since becoming a mum to Paul Jnr her life has taken a magical turn although at times it can be just as tiring and worrying too...
Now Sam invites her fans, fellow mums or mums-to-be on an unforgettable journey through motherhood.
Charting the highs and lows, she opens up about what being a mum is really like - from those treasured first cuddles and baby&#39;s first smile to dealing with leaking nappies and getting your body back in shape. Told in her no-nonsense, down-to-earth way Sam reveals that while having a baby is the best thing that has ever happened to her, caring for something so small is tough and the pressures put upon modern day mums can be even tougher.
As funny as they are emotional, Sam&#39;s experiences in this intimate read will offer comfort and advice to others, including her own healthy diet and fitness tips, while also opening up fans to a whole new side of Sam Faiers that even she didn&#39;t know before." />
