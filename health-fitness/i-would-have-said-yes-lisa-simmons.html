  <title>I Would Have Said Yes - Lisa Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If God asked your permission before a blessing or hardship, how would
you answer? Most would say yes to the blessing and no to the
hardship, especially if it involved our children. Thankfully, God does not
ask; rather, he gives us the gift of hindsightto look back and say yes to
the hardship that made us who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggle produces more strengths than weaknesses, more courage
than fear, and more resolve than complacency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookstores are filled with incredible stories of courage and overcoming
insurmountable odds. No one wants to read about a person who was
born, went to school, made average grades, got an average job, had an
average family and died an average death concluding with an average
funeral. We probably know lots of people like that, but there are no books
about them. No, we want the stories of the average overcomers. We
want to hear about the men, women, and families, just like ours, who
have faced their own Goliath and won, because we want to believe, we
too can muster the umph to make it through our own difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Would Have Said Yes&lt;/em&gt; chronicles an average family with above average
determination, who are blessed by an incomprehensible and
awesome God to see extraordinary miraclesone day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
