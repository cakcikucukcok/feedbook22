  <title>Selah in the Storm: Turning the Winds of Trauma - Captain Ana Donovitch, Dr P. Richard Verbeek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the deck of a sun-kissed sailboat off the coast of the Florida Keys, to the fluorescent-lit hallways of the trauma unit, this true story takes you on a suspenseful adventure of a husband and wife team as they leave everything to pursue their dreams of a sailing school. In the moments of a sunset, TRAUMA hits them not at sea, but on the coral gravel of the roadside. Ana shares the dissonant whispers we all have inside of us when we face life-threatening winds. Most of the time &amp;ldquo;life-changing&amp;rdquo; events happen to other people. We see them on the nightly news or trending topics on social media. But what happens when those other people become you? How do you respond when the storms of life crash upon your perfectly scheduled dreams? For those struggling to change the direction of their lives, Captain Ana Donovitch&amp;rsquo;s story of love, perseverance, and faith provides a compelling reason for examining ones own existence&amp;mdash;and embracing a newly defined life amidst a season of crisis. Selah in the Storm serves as an encouraging guide, revealing the complexity of trauma and how to support loved ones who are in the midst of recovery. Ana&amp;rsquo;s voyage inspires hope, humor, and the realization that no matter what the circumstances, we always have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
