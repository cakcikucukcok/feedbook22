  <title>Broken Chains - Randy Nurmi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Broken Chains: Principle to Overcoming Addiction is written for the individual who is caught in a lifestyle of bondage to sin and fear. It is also designed for anyone who has a loved one struggling with sins of this type and have a desire to educate, assist, and support him according to Gods Word. This book does not focus on motivational methods, but instead focuses on the foundational truths of Gods Word and its total sufficiency for solving all the problems facing man. This books purpose is to build hope for both the struggling addict and those who desire to help him through practical principles of faith, hope, and love through Jesus Christ. Individuals who are lost in the valley of addiction frequently ask God to remove the painful trial and its consequences for selfish reasons. Nevertheless, this time of trial, tribulation, and revelation of their true nature and character can be grasped as an opportunity to explore and expand their newfound faith and freedom in Christ.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The hope for these lessons would be to build an understanding and confidence for tackling everyday issues and provide encouragement to persevere as trials are overcome and victories are achieved on an every day basis. Success in overcoming the battle of addiction will depend on the individual acknowledging Christs ability alone to set him free from bondage to sin and fear, thereby breaking the chains of addictions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After 20 years of suffering, being full of pride and arrogance, lost in a dark and lonely world, and having the experience of trying time and time again to change myself through people, places, and things, I finally had a solitary but failed attempt at suicide. Christ Jesus was finally allowed to pour down His Mercy upon me and I was given the gifts of His Grace, Faith, Repentance, and Redemption and I was changed into a new man that was created according to God in true righteousness and holiness.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It was after this event that I received my calling from the Lord and He gifted me with a tremendous healing of the mind and the ability to remember His Holy Scriptures. I have sought to make Christ Jesus my Lord known to all men as I have come to know Him ever since. I have had the privilege of having the Lord educate and equip me for the last 25 years as a Pastor. The Lord has used numerous individuals, various Biblical courses and trainings, drug and alcohol education, and time of my own suffering in Christ to expand His purpose and plan for my life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 12:6-7: The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. You shall keep them, O Lord, You shall preserve them from this generation forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
