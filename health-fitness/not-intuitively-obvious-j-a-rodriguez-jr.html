&lt;P&gt;&lt;IFRAME src=&quot;http://www.google.com/talk/service/badge/Show?tk=z01q6amlqaqas2rgtimje81ianfcec1a2196qvp5i0q0rcrcmef37eeulqn3j7ikrj68i7hob27sn24s42b2ntv08fi4uqols39hsaj2l7nmc2qaft8gvioe1721kio6e2lg67pch2cbpbvlpdo7t83umsh788ia4trmgq59f3marslr9f2dqb467srbp8agot31p4dqpfumsk70vh6es960fvmbg&amp;w=200&amp;h=60&quot; frameBorder=0 width=200 height=60 allowTransparency&gt;&lt;/IFRAME&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Not Intuitively Obvious: Transition to the Professional Work Environment&lt;/B&gt; is a book directed at one goal: to provide you with the knowledge to excel in the professional work environment without the requisite of devoting many years learning from mistakes.  This priceless knowledge and eventual wisdom is not intuitively obvious and is offered to you from the memoirs of seasoned professionals, who have learned these lessons through years of experience, trials, tribulations, and hardships.
This book will teach you how to attain expectation fulfillment and manage the organizational perceptions that guide your professional destiny and is written from two perspectives: (1) a senior management perspective that details management thought processes and expectations of employees and (2) an employees perspective that sheds light on the reasons why some professionals rarely advance up the corporate ladder while others ascend successfully.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Your challenges, situational circumstances, and your conditions will be different; nonetheless, the concepts of integrity, ethics, perception management, performance and expectation fulfillment, respect for others, and respect for your company are everlasting. Apply the approaches described in this book, and you will increase your chances of succeeding in your professional endeavors. Rodrguez dispenses well-timed advice during difficult economic times, while also including a thought inspiring workbook. Informative and engaging, this book will help guide the new professionals destiny towards success by offering the keys previously only available to the seasoned professional.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
