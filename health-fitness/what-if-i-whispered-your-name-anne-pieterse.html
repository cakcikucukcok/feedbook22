  <title>What If I Whispered Your Name? - Anne Pieterse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if, you brought me a white rose
And placed the petals around my heart;
And then promised me
We would never ever part?
~ Whisper, by Anne Pieterse
In 1998, Anne Pieterse and her husband took their family on a beach holiday. Tragically their youngest son Kristo was swept away one day and they never saw him again.
Numb with pain, Annes own grief and the betrayal of those closest to her dragged her on a downward spiral into a soul-destroying depression.
It was a long journey through to the other side of grief in which she also had an affair and dramatic encounter with those who endured the 2004 South Asian Tsunami. But after much soul searching Anne discovered the source that would propel her back into a positive appreciation of life, love, nature and self.
Rich with poetry and vivid descriptions of her life, Journeying Beyond Grief is a moving account of Annes heartache, how she faced her demons and moved on.
Powerful, challenging and inspiring, What if I whispered your name should motivate and encourage others undertaking a similar journey." />
