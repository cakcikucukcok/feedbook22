  <title>The Cankerworm - Daniel Dube</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Competing in a 100 metres long race thrilled me
during my school days. I did not always fi nish
fi rst in the race, but the interesting point to me was
that, I always crossed the fi nishing line no matter
what. I used to observe some disappointment on my
fellow competitors whenever they fi nished the race
behind others. They complained about the weather
or just blamed themselves as being useless runners.
What they did not realise was that, we were all winners
because we all ran and crossed the fi nishing line. This
mentality helped me to believe that limitations did not
come from anyone but myself. No one was ever forced
by anyone to pull out of the race, that decision came
from an individual. Failure in anything is a matter of
choice. In my book The Cankerworm, I have identifi ed
the root causes of debt, distress and discontentment
that lie within and how they can be overcome. Doing
nothing is not an option. All issues in this book are real
and nothing is factious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God Bless&lt;br&gt;
