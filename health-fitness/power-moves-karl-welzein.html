  <title>Power Moves - Karl Welzein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet Karl Welzein, aka Captain Karl, aka @DadBoner on Twitter&amp;#8212;the Midwest&amp;#39;s most beautiful loser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karl Welzein is really lookin&amp;#39; forward to the weekend, you guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His job is a drag and his wife kicked him out, but that&amp;#39;s okay. She wears granny panties and is constantly dropping wads of cash at Target, and his son cries all the time. Now his &amp;#34;temporary&amp;#34; roommate, Dave, ate all the Totino&amp;#39;s pizza rolls. Again. Karl Welzein is sick of this. So sick of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power Moves&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the hilarious decline of Karl Welzein on his journey from life as a Dockers-and-golfshirt-wearing dad to a ponytailed party maniac who spits out his life philosophies like a modern-day Charles Bukowski (if he preferred to get drunk at Applebee&amp;#39;s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A middle-aged Michigan native, Karl may be overweight, prone to questionable fashion and culinary choices, oblivious to his drinking problem, a poor excuse for an employee, obsessed with the restroom, and a terrible husband, father, and friend . . . but in his heart he means well. He&amp;#39;s just like a lot of us&amp;#8212;he loves the USA, Guy Fieri, bold flavors, Bob Seger, and thinking he looks jacked in a tight tee and Maui Jim sunglasses. Karl is an everyman and like no other man on the planet all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Twitter feed @DadBoner, Karl finally tells his full story. He shares his wisdom on fitness (1. Look at a pic of Stone Cold Steve Austin. 2. Do &amp;#39;shups &amp;#39;til you look like Stone Cold. 3. Cut off your sleeves), diet (Eat only the filling of the Taco Bell Beefy Melts for maximum flavor and low-carb health), fashion (Wearin&amp;#39; boots with jean shorts says &amp;#34;I like to keep cool, but I&amp;#39;m ready if the action gets hot&amp;#34;), work life (If you don&amp;#39;t have a job that makes you want to kill yourself, you don&amp;#39;t deserve to drink until you want to die), and the bliss of the perfect weekend (beers, brats, and babes&amp;#39; chest beefers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But above all, this is a story about America&amp;#8212;the real red, white, and blue America of today. Welcome to Karl&amp;#39;s world. Reading this book is the ultimate Power Move.&lt;/p&gt;" />
