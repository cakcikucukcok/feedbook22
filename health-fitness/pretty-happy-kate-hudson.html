  <title>Pretty Happy - Kate Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like everyone else, Kate Hudson is constantly on the move, with a life full of work, family, responsibilities and relationships. In&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Pretty Happy&lt;/em&gt;, Kate shows how she honors her relationship with herself through exercise, making the right choices about what she eats, and constantly going back to the drawing board and starting fresh, instead of holding herself to unrealistic standards of perfection and giving up when she falls short.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In almost every interview she gives, Kate is asked the same questions: What do you eat? How do you stay so fit? What workout do you do? What&amp;#8217;s your secret? Well, the secret is that the sound bites the media loves so much don&amp;#8217;t tell the story, and the steps you need to take to have a healthy, vibrant and happy life can&amp;#8217;t be captured in a short interview. The key to living well, and healthy, is to plug into what your body needs, understanding that one size does not fit all, all the time, and being truly honest with yourself about your goals and desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the Four Pillars of Health to enhance well-being,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Pretty Happy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;shows the benefits of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cultivating an Intuitive Relationship With Your Body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating Well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awakening Your Body through movement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Miracle of Mindfullness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of questionnaires to help you assess your Body Type and your stress levels, advice about cleanses and keeping your diet and body balanced, and plenty of interactive Drawing Board exercises,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Pretty Happy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a beautiful, insightful, and personal look at health from the inside out, an authentic plan for an authentic life from a woman who truly lives what she speaks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
