  <title>Living Your Life Purpose - Sheelagh Maria Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When author Sheelagh Maria Wright began her journey with the angels, she wasnt looking for them and truly had no idea they existed in the real world. It was the birth and near
death of her youngest son that changed her views and her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Living Your Life Purpose&lt;/i&gt;, she shares her story of near tragedy, heartbreak, and then a slow, but magical climb upward. She offers practical, real-life methods to help guide you on your path to your lifes work, to help yourself and others in a much broader way. Sheelagh Maria teaches how angels can help, but she also discusses how you can help yourself. She addresses such topics as how to connect with the angels, how to raise your vibration, and how to work with angels to heal issues with money, relationships, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written with the help of Archangel Michael, &lt;i&gt;Living Your Purpose&lt;/i&gt; presents practical information to help you understand why situations are the way they are and what you can do to make them better. It communicates the message that each person has the ability to work with their gifts to make their world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
