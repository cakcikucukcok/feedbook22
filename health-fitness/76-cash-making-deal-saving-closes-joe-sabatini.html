When you really listen and hear what your customers have to say, you will create a bond with them that will build the rapport and trust with them that is critical to close your sale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Where the book really delivers is with the chapters on the 76 Closes. In the introduction, the author advises that if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to read this book in its entirety, you can skip to this chapter on sales closing techniques, and still reap terrific benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
