When you really listen and hear what your customers have to say, you will create a bond with them that will build the rapport and trust with them that is critical to close your sale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Where the book really delivers is with the chapters on the 76 Closes. In the introduction, the author advises that if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to read this book in its entirety, you can skip to this chapter on sales closing techniques, and still reap terrific benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

Not one, but two closes are dedicated to this customer. Sprinkled throughout this invaluable chapter are Catch All Closes that can be used in a variety of situations when you are having trouble determining which strategy to employ. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Becoming a highly effective sales person takes passion and a burning desire to make a connection with your customers as well as knowledge of how to close deals. With your passion and the excellent information in this book on how to build a connection with customers and close car sales, you will be ready to take the lead in any sales situation and rise to the top of your sales floor in any market.&lt;/p&gt;" />
