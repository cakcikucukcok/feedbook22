  <title>The Spiritual Protection Prayer - AnnaBel Silvers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Spiritual Protection Prayer
In the name and through the power of the blood of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, Holy Spirit take  control of our circumstances,situations, and conversations, through faith as we surrender our wills to You for this day.
All praises, honor, glory  are given to our Father, God, whose love and  presence,we have entered for He is worthy, mighty, and awesome to be praised.
First Stage, by surrendering your  will to Jesus, who is Lord and seated at the right side of our Heavenly Father, you will relinquish control of any situation or circumstance for an entire day.  The Holy Spirit who lives inside of you because you believe that Jesus Christ is your Savior has been given permission to control your  life. You will no longer be in charge because the Holy Spirit searches all things, yes, the epitome of the Heavenly Father, God, Himself.
Second Stage,now that your life is prioritized, you may think all of Hell has been released on you.  Why is this? Satan knows that you  will begin to learn  to have power over him, as well as his minions. It is God&#39;s responsibility as our Heavenly Father  to help you..now! He has been waiting for such a time as this. Satan is angry with you and  will now indefinitely try to destroy you.  However, you must remember, greater is He Father  (God)
in you  than he (Satan) is in the world. You will learn how  to live and deal through the power and the guidance of the Holy Spirit with your adversaries.
Third Stage,each and every day, you must commit and submit yourself  to our Heavenly Father in the name and through the blood of Jesus Christ- through His Word. God only promises protection one day at a time. God knows the beginning and ending of your  life- You Do Not! Jesus came to seek, save and  protect us one day at a time from being eliminated by the adversary. You will learn what God&#39;s Holy Spirit has to say to you on a daily basis.  Once you start reading God&#39;s Word, it will increase your  desire to want to study to find out what  God&#39;s will is and what He is all about.  You will learn to trust Him. Your life with His Word will speak to each and every one of your situations, regardless of what circumstances you are under. Aren&#39;t you glad about  that?  Praise God!
Fourth Stage, if you do not know how to believe that the prayer will work or somehow feel inadequate that your faith isn&#39;t strong enough, pray  to our Heavenly Father in the name and through the blood of His Son,Jesus Christ, to increase your faith and belief.  Difficult situations and circumstances will occur anyway. You will experience anxiety and despair because you are making non-spiritual choices in human flesh.  The Holy Spirit will not and cannot coerce your  will.  Why not surrender your will to an Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent Heavenly Father? He already knows all about you. You will be delighted to make Him your Lord.  He is faithful to the end.  He loves you.  You will  learn how to become obedient and  renew your  mind daily. Praise God!
Now through placing your  trust in God, through the power of the blood of JESUS CHRIST, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, your life will blossom with spiritual and  physical delights. His promises of what is best for you will materialize. It is beyond your imagination and scope of vision of what His will for your life will become over what you believe it should be. You will delight to be obedient and a servant to God&#39;s will.
Remember, if you have never been through anything, how can you teach others? We are our  brother&#39;s keepers. That is why Jesus came to save and give us life more abundantly.You will have grace for the pressures of the world, mercy for your failures as a human being and to keep both your heart and mind from pride, God&#39;s Peace. Hallelujah
You Are The Righteousness Of God In Christ Jesus" />
