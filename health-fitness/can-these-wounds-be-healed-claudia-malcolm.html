      <meta name="description" content="The power of God has added such richness to my life. Fear used to have dominion over me. I was a slave to my own mind! Oh but once you encounter the love of God you cannot remain the same. I now have a wealth of peace, wisdom, knowledge and understanding that I had never known before. God healed me both spiritually and naturally. He set me free from depression, low self-esteem and a painful and horrific past. Only Gods divine healing can provide such deliverance. His spirit and His word empower me and allow me to enjoy my new found freedom in Christ.
