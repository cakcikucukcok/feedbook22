  <title>Ethics for Trustees - Jane B. Lorenz, Marguerite C. Lorenz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written by two longtime Professional Fiduciaries, &quot;Ethics for Trustees&quot;, A Guide for All Who Serve as Trustee, is intended as a guideline for everyone who serves as a Trustee of a Trust; Experienced or inexperienced; Attorneys, Fiduciaries, CPAs, Family Members and Friends, etc. Quotes and concepts have been drawn from personal experience, from the Professional Fiduciary Association of California (PFAC) Code of Ethics and from the most recent California Probate Code (2011). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review by an experienced Trusts and Estates Attorney:&lt;br&gt;
Ethics for Trustees is an excellent guidebook that draws together important resources and reference materials.  It covers some topics few other writers have addressed, and the authors draw on wealth of personal experience.  The writing is clear and concise.  It is a valuable addition to my professional library. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review by an Independent Financial Advisor: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are already serving as a professional trustee or considering taking on this role for the first time, we recommend this book. Serving as a trustee is a challenging responsibility.  This book will help you understand what is expected of you and how to best meet the role of trustee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Authors:&lt;br&gt;
Jane B. Lorenz, CPA, CLPF has been practicing as a CPA since 1975 and started serving as a Professional Trustee around 1990. &lt;br&gt;
Marguerite C. Lorenz, CTFA, CLPF began working with Jane in 2003 and has been serving as a Professional Trustee ever since. &lt;br&gt;
This book is a labor of love. They know from experience the challenges facing todays Fiduciary, whether amateur or professional. Many professional Fiduciaries operate as sole proprietors, without partners or staff . Jane and Marguerite have benefitted so much from their partnership and business model, they feel good about sharing some of what they have learned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Readers:&lt;br&gt;
Everyone who is in the Estate Planning Process can benefit from a better understanding of what their Successor can and should do. The documents alone do nothing.  The selection of the appropriate Successor Trustee is vitally important, as this is the one trusted to fulfill the Estate Plan provisions. How can the right Successor be selected if the one choosing is not familiar with what the job entails?  Reading this concise volume gives the reader just what is needed. Before one accepts the role of Trustee he/she should understand the liability, the ethical issues and the depth of responsibility.   We believe that reading this book may prevent family upset and financial disaster. &lt;/p&gt;" />
