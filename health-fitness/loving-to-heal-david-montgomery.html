  <title>Loving to Heal - David Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Loving to heal is better than fighting to fix.David Montgomery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading David Montgomery&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Loving to Heal&lt;/i&gt; is like floating down a cool, gently flowing stream on a warm day: I felt buoyant, supported, exhilarated, and refreshed. His blend of medical science and spiritual wisdom leads to altered perspectives, enrichment, and contentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effortlessly and gratefully, I got out of the stream at a different place than I went in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Rau Stocker, author of Many Faces of PTSD: Does Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Have a Grip on Your Life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clarity and purpose of this masterful work stands as both testimony and guide to our individual quest to be all we can be in this one precious life. &lt;i&gt;Loving to Heal&lt;/i&gt; serves as an essential how-to manual for care givers of all genres, personal and professional, and its message carries immeasurable benefit to the caregiver and cared-for alike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane Lehr Eckert, PhD, counseling psychologist, life coach, energy medicine practitioner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book to all caregivers. As a matter of fact, I cant think of a single individual that would not benefit from this valuable resource!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Phillips, DC, certified Heal Your Life coach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dave administers the cure of healing thoughts and wise words with the carefulness and skill of a master healer and soul guide, which he is. This book is pure love, and the prognosis is lasting joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Katz, MA, author, vision-quest guide&lt;/p&gt;" />
