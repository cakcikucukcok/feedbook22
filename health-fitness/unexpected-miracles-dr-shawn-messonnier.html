  <title>Unexpected Miracles - Dr. Shawn Messonnier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Those soulful eyes that look up at you at the end of a rough day. The soft paws that knead into your lap and tell you with that you are &quot;theirs.&quot; Much more than a companion, more beloved than our nearest and dearest human family. Our pets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-three percent of all US households have them. Owners spend untold amounts of money on food, toys, even Christmas presents for their pets. And they don&#39;t stint when it comes to their pet&#39;s health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shawn Messonnier has been a veterinarian for more than fifteen years. Once a conventional practictioner, he&#39;s embarked on a crusade to help pet owners keep their treasured furry friends healthy and happy, treating each patient not as a disease but as a unique living entity. Dr. Messonnier brings the reader into his waiting room and introduces them to some remarkable animals...and the courageous owners who never gave up on their pets. Using case studies and higlighting diseases that commonly afflict our pets, Dr. Messonnier shows us the integrative methods he has developed to help these creatures not only survive the maladies they were originally diagnosed with but in many cases go on to live long and healthy lives.  &lt;i&gt;Unexpected Miracles &lt;/i&gt;will change the way you think about your  pet&#39;s healthcare forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
