  <title>The Art of Focus - Christina Bengtsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do you find that wonderful place of focus and complete presence? What can we achieve if we are more focused &amp;ndash; at work, in our relationships and in our own thoughts? To be focused is not hard, rather, it&amp;#39;s a pleasure. What&amp;#39;s hard is to &lt;em&gt;become &lt;/em&gt;focused. This book will guide you in the art of going from unfocused to focused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus is so much more than achievement. In a longer perspective, focusing is the ability to, throughout all the different possibilities and distractions in life, dare to choose and to stick with your choices. To be able to see the value in what you&amp;#39;ve got, even though you want more. A life with focus doesn&amp;#39;t aim at accomplishing more &amp;ndash; it&amp;#39;s about being just as good as you already are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christina is strongly convinced that the ability to focus is not only vital in specific, critical moments, but in life in general. In a world where we are always online and up-to-date, Christina will give you the tools to understand and practice the art of focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christina Bengtsson is a Swedish shooting world champion, lecturer and officer in the Swedish army.&lt;/p&gt;" />
