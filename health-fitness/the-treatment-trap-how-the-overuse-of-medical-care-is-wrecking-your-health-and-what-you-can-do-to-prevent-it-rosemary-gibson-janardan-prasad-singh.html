  <title>The Treatment Trap: How the Overuse of Medical Care is Wrecking Your Health and What You Can Do to Prevent It - Rosemary Gibson, Janardan Prasad Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;With health reform enacted by the Congress and signed by the President, the subject matter of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Treatment Trap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a compelling component in the national debate. Taking advantage of Rosemary Gibson&amp;#39;s knowledge gleaned from extended experience in the field of medical care and Janardan Singh&amp;#39;s similar knowledge but from a financial perspective, the authors explore the most neglected issue in American medicine today: the overuse of medical care, including needless surgery and other invasive procedures, out-of-control x-ray imaging, profligate testing, and other wasteful practices that have become routine among too many American doctors. Their combined reporting and analysis concentrates on the human aspects of this disturbing trend in health care, with personal experiences that reflect poorly on hospitals as well as physicians. They show how money spent for questionable and even useless care is diverting major funds that could be better used to treat patients who are genuinely sick and sometimes cannot afford the extravagant charges of the American health-care system. Their suggestions for reforming the delivery of health care, and their cautions to individual consumers about how to deal with situations they may encounter, make &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Treatment Trap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; essential reading for medical care consumers, health-care professionals, and policymakers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
