  <title>Journey’S End - Victoria Brewster, Julie Saeger Nierenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In Journey&#39;s End, many and varied collaborators write about death, dying, and the end of life. We attempt to describe real life issues and circumstances, and we discuss ways to proactively deal with them. Useful training, resource, and reference material is also included.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Death, dying, and end of life are topics many prefer to avoid. This book suggests that we benefit from having frank discussions, living life to the fullest, and planning for our own journey&#39;s end, whenever that may be. Everyone who is born eventually will die, whether or not we want to embrace that fact.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;****&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Though few of us know when we will die, we and our family or friends can be well prepared. We can have discussions and create written directives for what we want, if we are unable to verbally state them ourselves. Do we want life support? Do we want interventions that may or may not have any benefit to our quality of life if we are in the hospital or in an accident? Do we want to be involved in planning our funeral, memorial, or celebration of life?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The submissions within are from professionals in the field of death and bereavement support and from laypeople, all of whom share stories of dying family members, friends, clients, and patients. Julie and Victoria, the coauthors of this book, also share stories from their personal and professional experiences. Journey&#39;s End is a broadly comprehensive book about death, dying, and the end of life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
