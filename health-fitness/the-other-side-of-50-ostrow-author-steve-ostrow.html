  <title>The Other Side of 50 - Ostrow Author, Steve Ostrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This manuscript that you are reading is not a book in the traditional sense of
the word. It is rather a compilation of thoughts and experiences I have had and
various treatises that I have felt compelled to write over the last few years.
It is because of my desire to share these observations that I have decided to put
them together. They all served to codify my thoughts and feelings and convey
what I personally believe in areas of health of body, mind and spirit.
Because some of these articles were written at different times, you may find
certain truths repeated from time to time. Please forgive this and edit them
out; it is my feeling that they serve to reinforce that which has helped me to
arrive happily at three score and ten. I still refer back to this book as a resource
and find its validity for me to be sustaining. If it helps you to have at least one
happier day, it will have fulfilled its purpose." />
