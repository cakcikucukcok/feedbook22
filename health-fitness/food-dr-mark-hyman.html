  <title>Food - Dr. Mark Hyman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Dr. Mark Hyman sorts through the conflicting research on food to give us the skinny on what to eat.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Did you know that eating oatmeal actually isn&#39;t a healthy way to start the day? That milk doesn&#39;t build bones, and eggs aren&#39;t the devil? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Even the most health conscious among us have a hard time figuring out what to eat in order to lose weight, stay fit, and improve our health. And who can blame us? When it comes to diet, there&#39;s so much changing and conflicting information flying around that it&#39;s impossible to know where to look for sound advice. And decades of misguided &quot;common sense,&quot; food-industry lobbying, bad science, and corrupt food polices and guidelines have only deepened our crisis of nutritional confusion, leaving us overwhelmed and anxious when we head to the grocery store. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thankfully, bestselling author Dr. Mark Hyman is here to set the record straight. In &lt;i&gt;Food: What the Heck Should I Eat?&lt;/i&gt; -- his most comprehensive book yet -- he takes a close look at every food group and explains what we&#39;ve gotten wrong, revealing which foods nurture our health and which pose a threat. From grains to legumes, meat to dairy, fats to artificial sweeteners, and beyond, Dr. Hyman debunks misconceptions and breaks down the fascinating science in his signature accessible style. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; He also explains food&#39;s role as powerful medicine capable of reversing chronic disease and shows how our food system and policies impact the environment, the economy, social justice, and personal health, painting a holistic picture of growing, cooking, and eating food in ways that nourish our bodies and the earth while creating a healthy society. With myth-busting insights, easy-to-understand science, and delicious, wholesome recipes, &lt;i&gt;Food: What the Heck Should I Eat?&lt;/i&gt; is a no-nonsense guide to achieving optimal weight and lifelong health." />
