  <title>Stop Painful Parenting: Tales from Our Side of the Mat - Paul Prendergast, Carol Davis, Lcsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I opened my first karate school twenty six years ago, I would never have thought I would be dealing with parents who grew marijuana, had fist fights in my lobby, or moms who cheated on their husbands with other moms. I never thought I&#39;d deal with a mom so drunk she pissed her pants while waiting to pick up her child, or a boy who drew pictures with his own &quot;poo&quot; on the walls of my bathroom. My instructor never taught me how to defend myself against these types of attackers. It is my hope that by reading this book people will be more conscience of their words and actions when in the presence of their children or other people&#39;s children. People that become parents, guardians, coaches, teachers, mentors, or who influence children will become more aware how important their role is. Parents must understand if they want to see a change in their child, they must be the change they want to see." />
