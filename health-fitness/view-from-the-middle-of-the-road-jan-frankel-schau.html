  <title>View from the Middle of the Road - Jan Frankel Schau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every day in mediation offices around the world, parties come together to tell their unique story as it relates to a conflict in their lives.  In a single, prescient day, they expect to end their pending litigation.  Sometimes the resolution requires money.  Other times it requires an apology, an explanation or an agreement to put the conflict behind the disputants and move forward in peace.  Sometimes, it just requires an impartial set of ears, an open heart and a willing third party to lead the way with dignity, decency and humanity.  Such is the life of a mediator.
The mediator is the glue:  the compassionate ear that can listen deeply and find the connections between the two stories.  While lawyers are trained to fight for the rights of their clients, mediators are trained to look for the validity of both points of view.  It is, indeed, a different perspective.
View from the Middle of the Road is a highly entertaining collection of mediation stories based upon a year of self-reflective analysis by author and prominent Los Angeles mediator, Jan Frankel Schau.  The stories are intriguing, endearing and sometimes infuriating.  The author takes the time to describe her birds eye view and illustrate specific Mediators Tools used by her in each dispute.  Students of mediation, disputants and their counsel and Judges will find these tools incredibly useful and insightful.
Where parties have a seat at the negotiating table and can be fully heard with compassion, an open-mind and an open heart, the implications for peace-making extend far, far beyond the litigated case.  That is Jan Frankel Schaus View from the Middle of the Road:  A Mediators Perspective on life, conflict and human interaction." />
