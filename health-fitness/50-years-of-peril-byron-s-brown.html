  <title>50 Years of Peril - Byron S. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Byron Brown has written an excellent semi-autographical message that resonates with the reader. His excellent details in explaining his story, his journey, his troubles and his ultimately successful outcome all within the backdrop of a memoir of respect and admiration for his father is yet another
masterpiece accomplished by the author. Mr. Brown laments in the story the loss of his father in a tragic accident. Although no fault of the senior Mr. Brown, the tragic event led to many perils and what-ifs for the son. Yet, in Fifty Years of Peril: One Day of Illumination that Made the Difference, Byron Brown writes fearlessly in telling his story. This project was designed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the death of Mr. Samuel George Brown, Byrons father. It is indeed an honor and a tribute to the man that Byron missed while growing up. For the reader of this story, you are in for  a treat. Stephen J. LaBrie, MBA, Howard University." />
