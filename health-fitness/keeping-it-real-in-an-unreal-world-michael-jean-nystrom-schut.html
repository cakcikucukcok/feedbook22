  <title>Keeping It Real in an Unreal World - Michael Jean Nystrom-Schut</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;&amp;#8230In
this book, Keeping it Real in an Unreal World, Michael Jean Nystrom-Schut
examines the reality of illusion (or the illusion of reality?). He talks about
how we can come to pursue our best efforts at finding something that resembles
a path through the foggy haze of an earth-dwellers life, and the fuzzy twists
and turns and convolutions of existence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;If
our voyage is one of expectation, our reality will become just that. Its a
perceptual thing; how we each perceive it is a highly individual matter. If you
keep an open mind, Michael&#39;s promise is that rewards will come out of your
enthusiastic reading participation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Dont
assume you know anything whatsoever about real life; it goes better for us when
we think of it like that. In reality, each day we start out new, and each new
day presents itself with an entirely new set of illusions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;In
sorting out the illusions, we have the chance to make things happen in our
lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;The
book is presented in five sections. To begin with, in Section One the whole
matter of reality and illusion is examined. The next section talks about the
individual self, and what reality means to him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;The
third section explores reality close to home, in the lives of our mind, and
with our friends and family. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Section
Four moves into the outer world, where a global view of reality is addressed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Finally,
in the last section (Five), Michael takes on the great and perennial
metaphysical questions, doing his best to apply the human notions of God and
Universe to the world of the thinking self. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Michael
admits he is only sharing thoughts on how he narrowly see things. You will
hopefully have your own spin on reality, different from everyone else in the
world. Keeping it real comes in many shapes, sizes and colors. Each of us looks
at it uniquely, and what you are about to experience in this book is merely one
tiny sliver of reality perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;When
you are finished reading the book, it is Michael&#39;s hope that you will have
given more consideration to the matter of whats real and not real for
yourself. And that you will take valuable living information from it.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Reality.
Its a funny thing. How we negotiate our way through it goes a long ways
towards whether we adapt or fail in our experiences and encounters with life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Enjoy
your journey, both through the book, and through life!&lt;span
