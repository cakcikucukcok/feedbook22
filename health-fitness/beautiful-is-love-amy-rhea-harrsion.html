  <title>Beautiful Is Love - Amy Rhea Harrsion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The love that Jacob and Naomi Willem know is relentless, protective, strong, and filled with surrendered hurt.  In the ever changing growth of self and understanding, comes a life filled with mistakes &amp; forgiveness, and ethically challenging decisions that prove the Willems devotion &amp; self-sacrifice.
  Jacob &amp; Naomi Willem met in Omaha, NE, and soon married just before Jacob accepted an offer to college at MIT, in Cambridge, MA.  Naomi, a young artist, was eccentric and full of passion, an attribute that Jacob, the adventurous, brilliant, tall &amp; handsome-type, was completely drawn to.  
  When Jacob accepted a position near Glacier Point Peak Pass to be Head Engineer at a nuclear warhead facility, the Willem&#39;s were excited about their new future.  With Naomi questioning the possibility of reuniting with her lifelong friend, Rose Carson, they anxiously started their new lives.  After Naomi had a miscarriage of their first child, and Jacob had faced his temptations, they figured all the hard stuff was behind them.  So, in the summer of 1992, the young Willem&#39;s moved to Washington State, near Darrington.
  Fifteen years later, they found themselves in a world of confusion, explosions, bloodied cover ups, and illness.  They became proficient in telling lies.  
  Naomi questioned how they could ever remain together as she quickly felt the implications from a rapidly crumbling marriage.  However, when Rose came back into their lives, life as the Willem&#39;s knew it had changed, and Naomi would do anything to fight to keep their love alive.
  She whispered aloud, &quot;Beautiful is love:  Even if it is questionable.&quot;" />
