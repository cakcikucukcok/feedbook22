  <title>Morality and Rules of Happiness - Thomas Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;&quot;A man’s power of increasing happiness depends both directly and indirectly on his fitness for the occupations of his life.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;
The  object of these papers is to show what sort of moral law is likely to  arise, and what law appears to have arisen and to be in progress of  formation, when the guide of conduct is the increase of happiness —  individual happiness, and the happiness of those around us, with due  regard to the proper apportionment of altruistic and egoistic happiness.  I have not examined such questions as: What is happiness? What kind of  happiness is worthiest? and so forth. I have taken, as included in the  term &quot;happiness,&quot; all the various forms of pleasurable emotion of which  the human race is susceptible, while all the various forms of painful  emotion to which we are exposed have come naturally into consideration  as all involving greater or less diminution of happiness. With the  development of the human race, or of any part of the human race, in one  direction or in another (for development is multiform), we find that  ideas about pleasure and pain become modified in various ways. And it is  a special part of our subject to consider how the lower forms of  pleasure, those related first to the physical gratification of self, and  next those related specially to self but otherwise of higher type, give  place gradually to the higher gratifications arising from altruistic  relations. But, apart from such considerations, our whole inquiry is  into the development of conduct by the natural operation of those laws  which influence the development of happiness.&lt;/span&gt;
