  <title>The Human Condition - Craig Downey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this next book, in the self-help series, I began to examine all of these subjects that basically relate to the human condition and those things that we really cannot learn from or get advice from anybody onto allow us to fully understand the workings of the body mind and inner self and our place in the world from deeply internal and external perspectives.
The subjects cover all of those that provide or disallow us to fully experience life, and as with many other techniques, it is always about working around the edges to then get to the core of the issue in a process of reduction. To allow us to establish understanding that requires less maintenance than a fixed routine to reach a naturally organised state whereby inside issues move with paths of least resistance getting to the eventual state I like to refer to as a contentedness. 
The book is basically about well-being, getting a better experience out of life, and most of all, getting to the ultimate state and this contentedness. This is a very wide subject and basically is a state of mind that allow us to order everything you want to achieve in life, and all things that you have done to date it allow you to get out those skeletons and really air everything from the past so it does not create blockages in our thinking or prevent a oneness or most of all, prevent us from cringing every time we think of that event.
So as is the way, lets start this journey, and hopefully by the end of this, you are not only fully prepared to overcome these issues but, most of the way through this subject, with a thorough understanding to again take on the world." />
