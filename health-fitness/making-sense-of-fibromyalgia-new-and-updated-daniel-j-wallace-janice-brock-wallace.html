  <title>Making Sense of Fibromyalgia: New and Updated - Daniel J. Wallace, Janice Brock Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Six million people in the United States meet the criteria for fibromyalgia, which is a disorder characterized by a combination of pain, fatigue, and related symptoms. On average, these patients see about four doctors before they are correctly diagnosed, and many are convinced they have a life-threatening illness such as an advanced stage of cancer.  About $600 billion is spent annually in the United States to diagnose or manage chronic pain, including litigation fees, and it is estimated that fibromyalgia patients run up $20 billion in medical expenses annually. Despite these alarming numbers, there is a lack of understanding and a dearth of reliable information about fibromyalgia for patients.  This fully updated edition of Making Sense of Fibromyalgia distills complex concepts and symptoms into an easily understandable narrative. Daniel J. Wallace, a leading rheumatologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and Janice Brock Wallace, an expert medical writer, have updated the original classic resource, which has sold over 100,000 copies since 1999.   Making Sense of Fibromyalgia provides clear answers to common questions, explains findings from the latest research, and discusses treatment options for complex symptoms. Detailed information is provided about topics such as who gets fibromyalgia and why; how stress, hormones, and your immune system interact and relate to fibromyalgia; what conditions are associated with it; why and how you might be misdiagnosed; how to overcome fibromyalgia; and how to understand your prognosis. The authors share all there is to know about the syndrome as well as how our understanding of it has changed over time. This comprehensive companion covers the entire spectrum of issues for those suffering from fibromyalgia, as well as their families, friends, caretakers, primary care physicians, and other health professionals." />
