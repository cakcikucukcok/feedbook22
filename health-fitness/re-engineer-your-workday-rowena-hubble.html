  <title>Re-Engineer Your Workday - Rowena Hubble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;How can you spend less time in the office and be a better employee, leader, friend and family member as a consequence? Is it possible?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We live a fast-paced, demanding life; many of us are constantly busy, often short on time, and running behind. We often feel buried in things to do and drained of the capacity to do them. The busyness routine often results in us sacrificing important areas of our life, such as family, friends, physical and emotional health, in exchange for sheer hard work.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Drawing on her experiences in corporate life, author Rowena Hubble, who is also the mother of two, shares her story on how you can achieve the perceived nirvana of life-work balance. She explains how you can create time for work, home, family, health and the community.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Re-engineer your Workday  Create time for life&lt;/i&gt; will provide you the tools and techniques to make positive change to your workday. You will learn how to achieve better results in less time and have the time to do all those things outside of work that are important to you. It is possible to have it all.&lt;/P&gt;" />
