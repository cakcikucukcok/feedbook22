  <title>The Follicle Chronicles - Roberta P. Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God is life, and what is life without experiences and experiences without going through good and bad changes? Everyones lives are filled with these experiences. Being a blessed stylist for thirty-plus years gives me the opportunity to share my world by writing about them, which birthed The Follicle Chronicles. It is a series of stories inspired by God, customers, family, and dear friends. I felt that writing these stories could possibly inspire help and even change someones life for the better. Without pain theres no pleasure, without hate love cant prevail, and without sorrow, joy cant come forth. So with an open mind, sit back, relax, and buckle up because the ride of life is about to take you into the unknown. Enjoy continuously!" />
