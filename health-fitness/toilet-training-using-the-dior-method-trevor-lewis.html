  <title>Toilet Training Using the Dior Method - Trevor Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DON&#39;T WASTE TIME AND MONEY BUYING OTHER BOOKS or so-called potty training devices, when 1000&#39;s of parents found that THE &#39;DIOR METHOD&#39; TOILET TRAINING BOOKLET WAS ALL THEY NEEDED!  Hi, I am a New Zealand Behaviour Specialist, with many years of study and experience behind me, I wrote this toilet training booklet in frustration and despair by how many Parents I came across who had struggled for months, in some cases years, to toilet train their child.  * Learn why you SHOULDN&#39;T use potties! * Toilet training for NIGHTS as well as days * Wees and POOS in the loo! * Covers lots of &quot;What ifs?&quot; * Strategies suitable for almost any child and parent!  I have designed the booklet to be helpful for Parents of typical children, and for those with a child with autism or an intellectual disability.  &quot;Fantastic Booklet, I highly recommend every parent with toddlers buys one of these. I am highly impressed, and my little boys are onto day two of toilet training with no accidents! Thank you!&quot;" />
