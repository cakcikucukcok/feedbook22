  <title>SOCIAL MEDIA: NEW MENACE TO MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS : How To Manage The Distractions And Effects Of Social Media On Relationships - William Appiah, Dorothy Appiah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The advent of social media has brought several advantages into society. It has for example improved communications. However, the downside which is subtle is that it is creating more distractions in marriages than can be expected. Couples do not have time for interpersonal communication and intimacy. The resulting effect is pushing them sometimes to have affairs due to lack of attention, intimacy, and show of love. If couples do not get intimate, do not have time to talk and listen to each other, then they will be creating problems in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book, &lt;em&gt;Social Media: A New Menace To Meaningful Relationships,&lt;/em&gt; is written to inform married couples about the dangers of too much attention to social media to the detriment of improving their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some relationships over rely, for example, on sending text messages to the extent that, even at home, some couples prefer to send text messages to their spouses instead of talking to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book, which focuses on &lt;em&gt;How to Manage&lt;/em&gt; The&lt;em&gt; Distractions And Effects Of Social Media On Relationships, &lt;/em&gt;details the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;effects that social media has on relationships. It also details the health effects on individuals and provides solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The failure of individual Christians to prioritise their marriage at the expense of using social media does not help in promoting the marriage. The good book encourages us to let our light shine before men so that they may see our good deeds and give glory to our Father who is in heaven. Our marriage is the only one that others may see and be encouraged to stay married. It is important for couples to give much attention to their marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to miss out on the relevance of social media in this modern age. But remember that having a happy and fulfilled marriage devoid of the distractions of social media will help sustain your relationship for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advent of social media has brought several advantages into society.
