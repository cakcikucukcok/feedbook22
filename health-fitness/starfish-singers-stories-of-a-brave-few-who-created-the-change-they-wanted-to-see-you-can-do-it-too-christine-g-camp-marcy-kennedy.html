  <title>Starfish Singers: Stories of a Brave Few Who Created the Change they Wanted to See. You Can Do it, Too - Christine  G Camp, Marcy Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Within every society and every generation, there are things that need to change. Often we wait, hoping for someone else to bring about that change because it&amp;rsquo;s easier and safer to follow rather than lead. But if everyone felt that way, change would never happen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are seven stories of brave women, past and present, who dared to fight stereotypes and oppression to change their world. You can do it, too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Starfish Singers are women like Amanda Jolley, a creative genius who designed a life-changing program that is empowering at-risk students to break free from generational violence; Virginia Woolf, a first-wave feminist who despite a debilitating illness used her eloquent writing to confront gender inequality; Bella Guerin, who stepped into history as the first woman in Australia to gain a Bachelor of Arts degree, proving that women have brains; and Andrea Musulin, a police officer on a mission to create a generation with the mindset that children have the right to feel safe; and more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In these stories you&amp;rsquo;ll discover:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;How to use your talents to help others find their voice, sense of belonging and hope&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;What motivates people to discover their callings and follow their visions&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;That it&amp;rsquo;s not too late to change your world&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;" />
