  <title>Rays and Rains - Aparajita Bose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You are a potter. I am a potter. We are all potters. The life we have got is the clay. 
We are all potters, building our lives, building the early life of our children.
There are rules, thousands of them, to build this life, to make it perfect.  They form the potters wheel. 
But, just as you would be more comfortable shaping your own pot with your own hands, and keep the wheel aside, you would likewise love to shape your life or your childs life with your experiences, your thoughts that visit you, your intuition and the mix of delightful as well as not-so-delightful stories and thoughts and experiences shared by fellow-potters  because these together are your hands.
In this journey of life, we pass through rays and rains - the happy and not-so-happy experiences - some experiences with near and dear ones and some with acquaintances and some experiences that are not ours but as real as ours, because they are experiences of people, as real as us, though not known to us.
And as we keep building the pot, we exchange our thoughts with people who too are shaping their pots with their hands. These are thoughts about us and also about our children, about what we see and what we hear and what we feel about ourselves as we move from being people to being parents, from being not-perfect to being trying-to-be-perfect for the sake of the children and finally to being just ourselves" />
