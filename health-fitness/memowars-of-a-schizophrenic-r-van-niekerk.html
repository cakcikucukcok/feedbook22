  <title>Memowars of a Schizophrenic - R. van Niekerk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I hear voices in my head, they come to me, they    understand, they talk to me, they  understand, they talk to me and this is what they say:  I am  the guided one.
Let me relate to you a story of a boy between the age of 5 and 8.  Whose favourite program was bible stories. He use to watch this every Sunday, he never missed it almost like most people do with 7de laan now-a-days. Every Sunday the story was about a   different prophet like Moses, David, Noah,  Abraham and Jesus the son of Mary. I remember every       Sunday when  the boy watched that program he use to think I wonder what it would be like to be a prophet, to make the blind see, to speak to different people&#39;s intellect, to proclaim the oneness of  God the Creator, the One the Only, Firm Establish on the Throne of Authority. I think that was his biggest dream to work for the One the Only, the Creator, the Merciful, the One we all call God,  Whom we all take for granted. Little did he know that the road he choose was not going to be easy, little did he know  there would be some people who is going to love him, the message that he would preach and  there would be others who would hate him and try to     discredit, destroy and maybe even kill the poor little boy, kill him for speaking  the truth from the Bible and the Holy Quraan. 
So tell me on what side would you be? Would you love him or hate him? How and where do you find your Creator?" />
