  <title>Crawling Out - Casey Morley, Nancy Hooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How does a child know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; What is acceptable or unacceptable?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; Normal or abnormal?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; That children aren&amp;rsquo;t slaves?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; Good or bad?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; That women aren&amp;rsquo;t beaten?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do they get out of something they don&amp;rsquo;t know they&amp;rsquo;re in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crawling Out is a true account of Casey Morley, a child raised in a dysfunctional family filled with abuse, domestic violence, and alcoholism that continued well into her adult life. This story will awaken you to the truth about children robbed of their innocence, childhood, and their birthrights. The toll abuse takes on their lives often sets them up to repeat history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey&amp;rsquo;s story chronicles years of coping with, and crawling out from, abuse&amp;mdash;working hard to break the cycle to end generations of dysfunction. Watch her as she deletes what she was taught, and fights to shed fifty-plus years of shame and guilt that weren&amp;rsquo;t hers to carry. Through each struggle, you&amp;rsquo;ll witness Casey&amp;rsquo;s pain, admire her strength and courage, and feel the depth of a mother&amp;rsquo;s love as she fights to make a better life for her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey has defied the odds and overcome a deep sense of worthlessness, unmasked the secrecy many victims carry, and learned to forgive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With awareness, as a society, we have the ability to end domestic violence. Crawling Out is that first step.&lt;/p&gt;" />
