  <title>The Running Life - Michael Dove, Donald Buraglio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Writers like Donald and Mike work at the grassroots level to promote and support our sport. Their love of running shines through every page of what they write. They have a unique perspective on The Running Life and make us smile and gain insight at the same time. Whether you are an experienced runner, a novice, or even a non-runner this compilation of articles will inspire.   --Amby Burfoot, Editor at Large, &lt;i&gt;Runners World Magazine&lt;/i&gt; and 1968 Boston Marathon winner
&lt;p&gt;
As a resident of Pacific Grove, Im just like all the other runners on the Central Coast. We eagerly await the Thursday edition of the Monterey Herald so we can see what Donald and Mike are thinking and saying about The Running Life. Its great that this book will allow a wider audience the opportunity of reading these great columns.--Blake Russell, 2008 Womens Olympic Marathon
&lt;p&gt;
Im out in Buraglio and Dove territory every year for the Big Sur Marathon. Its great to swap stories with Donald and Mike, run, and enjoy the magnificent Central Coast. They are both very knowledgeable and their articles cover every aspect of our sport. A fun read for sure.--Bart Yasso, Chief Runner, &lt;i&gt;Runners World Magazine&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ive always been an instinctive runner. I love to run and feel the flow. Donald and Mike capture all I love about running in their articles. They know the spirit as well as the technical side of running. I recommend this series of articles for anyone. You will really capture and understand why we love &lt;i&gt;The Running Life.&lt;/i&gt; --Nelly Wright, Pacific Grove, California, 1984 Womens Olympic Marathon" />
