  <title>Your Health Destiny - Eva Selhub, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An internist and clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School fuses Eastern practices with cutting edge Western medicine to help you connect body and mind to transform your health today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of her decades-long career, Dr. Eva Selhub has discovered a fundamental truth: health, happiness, and strength are often a direct result of the affirmative choices we make, regardless of whatever genetic or environmental setbacks we face. When our bodies get sick, we often feel out of control&amp;#8212;a cycle of fear that leaves us feeling vulnerable and helpless, desperate for medication or tests that will make us well. But illness shouldn&amp;#8217;t make us afraid. We do have control over our wellbeing, contends Dr. Selhub, and we can make choices that can positively influence any health issue, big or small, acute or chronic. It&amp;#8217;s all about perception&amp;#8212;how you view yourself, your resources, and your circumstances. Drawing on findings in the emerging field of epigenetics, she reveals how we can bolster the mind-body connection and actually change the way our DNA operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Your Health Destiny&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Selhub teaches you how to pay attention to your body&amp;#8217;s signals, to understand what these signals mean, and to make the right choices that will bring amazing results to your health, now and for the future. You will discover ways to prevent disease from happening or getting worse; and even find that you can reverse the disease process all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have more power than we think. &lt;em&gt;Your Health Destiny&lt;/em&gt; shows you how to harness it to improve your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
