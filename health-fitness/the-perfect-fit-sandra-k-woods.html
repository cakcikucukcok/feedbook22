  <title>The Perfect Fit - Sandra K. Woods</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do opposites really attract?
Why doesnt my partner understand me?
What can I do to make this relationship work?
The Perfect Fit, by Dr. Sandra K. Woods, explores and answers these questions and more. Woods proposes the existence of two basic temperament types that are opposite and complementary in nature: one of Being, and one of Doing. She discusses the underlying dynamics, the traits common to each temperament type, and the attractive forces that bind the two together. 
She also proposes a simple neurochemical template upon which these basic temperaments are superimposed. Examples from everyday life are used to illustrate natural differences in the imprinting of psychic feeling, which can and does lead to natural differences in perception and communication. The author describes and defines qualities common to all feelings, as related to fitting, bonding, weight, and contagion. Finally, a consideration of the five stages of marriage is discussed within the context of these basic differences. Common pitfalls are examined along the way. 
With some solid grounding in understanding the differences between these two basic temperament types, it is indeed possible to have a mutually fulfilling relationship, as partners work to understand, trust, and accept each other.
In The Perfect Fit Dr. Sandra Woods, based on her understanding of the brain and her long experience as a professional, has created an engaging presentation of the nature of human temperament.  Starting with a clear and very readable exposition based on neuroscience and the chemistry at work in the brain, she leads us to an understanding of the spectrum of personality types from Be-ers, who literally live for the moment, to Do-ers, who carefully plan their actions with an eye on the future. Wonder why you are an impulse buyer?  Or, wonder why you take forever to decide on a major purchase?  This little gem of a book will help you understand who you are.
