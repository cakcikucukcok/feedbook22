  <title>I’Ll Have Mine Straight Up - Heidi Heath Garwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ELEVEN YEARS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shhhhh!  Enough on the years. I am not collecting years, just days. 4017 days on my sobriety birthday, July 12, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time I checked, we are all on the same day&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year leading up to my sobriety birthday in July looked strangely like the six months leading up to the day I stopped drinking. From January to July in 2004, 
I was not sober much of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We received the news this year that my husband had a rare form of thyroid cancer requiring surgery and two types of radiation. During that same time, my mother died suddenly of a heart attack. I went through the loss of several other friends and their memorials tightly packed together right after my moms deaththen recently, my only nieces death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didnt drink through any of what has happened this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing in this life that we can experience that a drink wont make worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking through the emotions of it all is hard. People said I would feel better when I got sober. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am feeling my feelings better because I am present. Stuffing the feelings by drinking was keeping me in denial and stuck. I feel better  because I am not checking out. Feelings are not facts. The feelings pass. Growth happens. I can move on and live.&lt;?p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I am living all of this life straight up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can too. I pray that for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
