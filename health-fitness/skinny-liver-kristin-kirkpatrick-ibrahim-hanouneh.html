  <title>Skinny Liver - Kristin Kirkpatrick, Ibrahim Hanouneh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Based on the latest research, &lt;em&gt;Skinny Liver&lt;/em&gt; is an authoritative,  easy-to-follow guide not just for your liver, but for your whole body.&lt;/b&gt;              &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The liver is the seat of our overall health and wellness and the health of nearly every organ is intimately connected with our liver. A healthy liver is essential to a fully functioning body, but our modern sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits can truly damage the liver--and damage our health overall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A silent health crisis is impacting one-third of the American population---nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Because its symptoms often don&#39;t manifest until the liver is seriously compromised, many people are not aware that they are at risk. Did you know that if you have fatty liver disease, you are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease (heart attack and stroke), and potentially several devastating conditions such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer? Did you know that fat is as dangerous as alcohol to the liver?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Award-winning dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick and hepatologist Dr. Ibrahim Hanouneh have teamed up for a life-changing program that will help you achieve optimal health. &lt;em&gt;Skinny Liver&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s four-week program shares the steps you can take to get your liver health back on track, with everything from exercise to healthy eating and other lifestyle changes--along with delicious liver-friendly recipes. &lt;br&gt;" />
