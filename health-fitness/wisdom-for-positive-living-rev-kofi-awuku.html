  <title>Wisdom for Positive Living - Rev. Kofi Awuku</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is a platform suitably afforded to humans for meaningful survival by their potential. Since nothing happens in a vacuum, the journey to meaning eventually cannot begin except when there is information, pieces of information for awareness and guidance and to avoid danger and to take prospective steps. This is knowledge, and it is useless except when there is that energy or quality to convert it into specific results; that is wisdom. In a simplistic definition, therefore, knowledge is having information about something, and wisdom is the ability to use information or knowledge to achieve desirable results in whatever respect. 
In human existence, knowledge and wisdom importantly became the sole applicable instruments for strategic living. These remain the architects, engineers, builders, and decorators of human existence by the propulsion of cognitive excellence, but people have not profoundly endeared themselves to these values. 
The default, crystallizing as ignorance, accounts for most of the poor and miserable survival of people. Most humans will not be trapped in many unfortunate but avoidable issues of life if these priceless values are anchored. This material reveals their matchless power as these remain all-time doers, keys for preservative living and greater upward adjustments." />
