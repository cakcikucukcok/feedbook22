  <title>Someday - David E. Lash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been around people who mentally wear you out with their negativity? Or are you caught up in negative thoughts about the outcome of your life and the relationships in it? Do you feel as though youre floundering, with no hope of a better life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author David E. Lashs &lt;em&gt;Someday: The Excuses We Tell Ourselves&lt;/em&gt;, aims to get you to look at yourself honestly and to understand you are exactly where you are supposed to be based on your belief system. Change your belief system,  change your life. Lash is no stranger to the struggles of the everyday individual. He isnt super-financially rich, doesnt have an island home, or anything over the top like that. A self-employed, middle-class entrepreneur, he faces the same life issues most of us do daily. Divided into two parts, &lt;em&gt;Someday&lt;/em&gt; is meant to be a quick, daily read. Youll learn what forces and influential people shaped the author as a young boy. Some may sound familiar. Lash shows you the importance of being a proactive rather than reactive person. He shares six principles to becoming a proactive person, how to build on those pillars one at a time, and how you can benefit from adopting those elements and embracing change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change can be scary. But as youll discover in &lt;em&gt;Someday: The Excuses We Tell Ourselves&lt;/em&gt;, it can bring you the life you desire. You dont have to settle for a lesser life that leaves you unsatisfied and wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
