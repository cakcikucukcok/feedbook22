  <title>A Journey Through Dementia/Alzheimer&#39;s Disease - Geraldine  McCall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nora Scruggs McCall was a deeply religious woman who never lost her faith that God was always in control, and that everything would work out as it should. Even as her dementia progressed, she continued working as a volunteer grandmother. She also continued attending church services at Mount Calvary Baptist Church every weeknight and on Sundays. As Nora goes into decline, the task of taking care of her falls to her second eldest daughter, Gerry. With power of attorney, Gerry must try and unite her siblings John, Jessie, Jeannie, and Carolyn, in agreeing how to handle their mother&#39;s declining health, and eventually how to settle her estate. A Journey Through Dementia/Alzheimer&#39;s Disease is Gerry&#39;s story as she struggles to take care of her mother and resolve her divided family&#39;s conflicts. It is a story that will undoubtedly resonate with anyone who has cared for a family member suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s or dementia." />
