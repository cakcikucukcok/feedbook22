  <title>Thriving in a 24-7 World - Michelle Kaeser, Peter Jensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where the demands we face as professionals, parents and students has grown exponentially, yet the amount of hours in a day has stayed constant. Many people turn to time-management strategies to keep up with the growing to-do list. But time is finite, and its outside of our control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy management, on the other hand, is within our control. Its about striking a balance between moments of high performance and periods of renewal. Getting enough rest and recovery, leveraging our stressors and enjoying the presence of our loved ones are positive actions connected to energy management. In Thriving in a 24-7 World, author and high performance expert Peter Jensen shows you how to manage your energy to not only perform better but also live a healthier and happier life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jensen tells the fictional story of sixty-eight-year-old sports psychologist Ken Coghill and how he introduces the world of energy management to an elite basketball team, high performers at an IT firm and callers to his weekly radio show. Thriving in a 24-7 World imparts critical skills that lead to resiliency and excellence in environments where pressure and the need for high performance are equally present. Based on considerable research, Jensen offers guidelines to leading more enjoyable, less stressful lives without sacrificing achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thriving in a 24/7 World is another coaching masterpiece produced by Peter Jensen that helps us frame, manage and maximize the impact of our&lt;br /&gt;
precious life energy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Rick Hansen- Man in Motion, CEO, The Rick Hansen Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyone with the mental and physical energy of a chef should read this book. Dr. Jensens light &amp; witty style gives a recipe for success!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Michael Bonacini- Oliver Bonacini Restaurants, MasterChef Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beautifully written. As you read it you will feel as if you personally are sitting with Peter and listening while he explains, inspires and just generally shares his wisdom about how you can leave behind old habits of being a thermometer, and fi nally be the thermostat you want to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Julian Barling, PhD- Borden Chair of Leadership, Queens School of Business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Peter Jensen has created an easy read with a lot of substance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
