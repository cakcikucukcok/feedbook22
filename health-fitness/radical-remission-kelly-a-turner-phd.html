Turner, founder of the Radical Remission Project, uncovers nine factors that can lead to a spontaneous remission from cancer&amp;#8212;even after conventional medicine has failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While getting her Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkley, Dr. Turner, a researcher, lecturer, and counselor in integrative oncology, was shocked to discover that no one was studying episodes of radical (or unexpected) remission&amp;#8212;when people recover against all odds without the help of conventional medicine, or after conventional medicine has failed.&amp;#160; She was so fascinated by this kind of remission that she embarked on a ten month trip around the world, traveling to ten different countries to interview fifty holistic healers and twenty radical&amp;#160;remission cancer survivors about their healing practices and techniques.&amp;#160;Her research continued by interviewing over 100 Radical Remission survivors and studying over 1000 of these cases.&amp;#160; Her evidence presents nine common themes that she believes may help even terminal patients turn their lives around.&lt;/p&gt;" />
