  <title>Water Under the Bridge…Rises - Natasha Owens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Water under the BridgeRises is a short story about three friends who succumbed to the temptation of hasty decision making. When a pregnant Marilyn accidently discovered that her husband, Dominic, the man she loved very much, had an affair with her best friend, Gwendolyn, she completely severed their friendship and clung to her married life. 
Marilyn kept her knowledge of the affair from Dominic and worked very hard to achieve the perfect family life, while Gwendolyn not wanting their friendship to end, reluctantly moved on leaving that point in her life behind. 
A quarter of a century later, time would not allow the separation to continue. They all must face what they had done and come to terms with it. With conflict avoidance as the persevering factor that gave reason for their past decisions, will strength, serenity, and wisdom be the remissive factor that brings them to the other side of the proverbial bridge?" />
