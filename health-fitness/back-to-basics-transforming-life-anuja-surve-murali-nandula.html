  <title>Back to Basics - Transforming Life - Anuja Surve, Murali Nandula</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Close your eyes and look at the number of opportunities that exist in the world.
Everything that you are interested in, you can do. We all have passion and the potential to realize them.
If Education is the manifestation of perfection already in man, why do we not see people realizing their full potential? Is there something wrong with the education or are we not learning enough?
Is there an obstacle that is stopping us from realizing our potential? 
The journey is what this book is all about.
It is about looking at each stage of life, looking at what is stopping us from realizing our potential and breaking the barrier.
Welcome to the journey of understanding ourselves by going back to the basics and transforming life, forever." />
