  <title>What Every Man Really Needs! - Ira Epstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Men do not diet. They only want to lose weight if and when it becomes a problem for them physically or medically. Men believe they are never going to die or get seriously ill, so in their minds, what is the point. The major problem with diets is that they all cater to the idea that losing weight quickly is a worthwhile goal. The majority of these fad diets are just re-creations of older diets that have failed. These diets are also built around women&#39;s physiology and completely ignore the specific nutritional needs of men. The American Medical Association and The American Dieticians Association both agree that in the long run these diets are unhealthy and could lead to serious health problems, especially for men. The other problem is lack of exercise. Men need to exercise to maintain their bone and muscle mass and to burn unwanted calories. One of the best exercises for men is sex. The health benefits are many, and it is something men will do any time the opportunity is presented. It is said that, &quot;a women can use sex to get what she wants, but a man can&#39;t because sex is what he wants&quot; And in order for men to be able to have a greater intimate relationship and reap the health benefits from a more active sex life, they must learn how to communicate better with their significant others." />
