  <title>Triumph of the Spirit - Essie Thibodeaux-Lyles, Lionel Lyles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most formidable tasks that an individual faces today is to learn this simple truth: That is, life is a journey of self-realization. &quot;Getting&quot; thoughts create barriers that prohibit understanding. An affected person is unconsciously misled to believe that the only reality that exists is the one experienced by the five senses. As such, spirituality is reduced to a mechanical affair, where the soul is bound and heaven is perceived as being a distant place that is unexperienceable until after death.
&lt;P&gt;
The message contained in this book illuminates the idea &quot;heaven is a choice, and it can be experienced NOW.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
To claim this miracle for self, it is necessary to re-work the thoughts in the mind. Those that create what is not wanted must be &quot;let go,&quot; and, as a mother bear protects her cub, one must guard the thoughts allowed into the mind. Taking personal responsibility is at the heart of this self-work. 
&lt;P&gt;
This personal revolution is a process. Any courageous enough to claim it can expect to create the following: intimate social relationships, responsive political systems, schools that teach children Who They Are, and loving families." />
