  <title>Win Her Love Fast In Less Than 30 Minutes Without Saying A Word Even If You’re Timid, Broke And Ugly. - Williams Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Several years ago I knew a woman who had a very real problem. She couldn&amp;#39;t get past the second or third date with a guy without him showing up for the fourth date with a ring. Essentially, every single guy she agreed to go on a date with-pretty much without exception-fell in love, fell hard, and knew very quickly that he&amp;#39;d be foolish to let this woman go. So this was a rare woman indeed. And guys sensed it. They all WANTED to marry her. No &amp;quot;freedom loss&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cutting their nuts off&amp;quot;. They DESIRED a committed relationship with this woman...and FAST.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was beautiful, talented, fun to be around, earned multiple six-figure incomes, and was of impeccable character. She seemed 21 though her chronological age was 35. And she was also humble and utterly blind to social pretense. In her mind, all she was ever doing on dates was being her smiling, affable self.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But begrudgingly, she knew she had to do what she had to do. So she did what I refer to as &amp;quot;Charm Throttling&amp;quot;. Seriously, she began to ratchet back the &amp;quot;shock and awe&amp;quot; of her overall sharpness a few notches when she started dating a guy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, by no means did she change who she was at her core. Not at all. Rather, she simply held a few of the more impressive cards in her deck in reserve for a while.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you find yourself face to face with a woman of fantastically exceptional quality, you may very well find that she behaves toward you in a similar manner. So &amp;quot;heads up&amp;quot;, there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I have a better reason for bringing all this up. And that is that I fully expect YOU to have to learn this lesson for yourself in the very near future because it&amp;#39;s not exactly a gender-specific one. You may even need to figure it out RIGHT NOW, yet you don&amp;#39;t even realize it yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the deal. Granted, the vast majority of guys out there will spend their entire lives begging for a date with even mediocre women. Of the minority that remains, most will be thrilled to end up with a great woman...ANY great woman. But just like the woman I just told you about was a rare, exquisite gem amongst a sea of women who wonder why their boyfriends (if any) hang around for years without marrying them, you have the ability to be an AMAZING MAN who stops even the sharpest women dead in their tracks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Women actively COMPETE to WIN guys like that. And you guessed it: Those are the guys who have TOTAL CONTROL over their dating lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know what you&amp;#39;re saying. &amp;quot;Williams, that&amp;#39;s got to be fewer than 1% of all guys.&amp;quot; Granted. But also remember that over 99% of all guys are too bullheaded to ask for directions. And even when guys DO ask for directions when getting better with women, they end up learning how to &amp;quot;pickup&amp;quot; strippers or something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So simply by being here, I&amp;#39;d say your odds are pretty good. By even THINKING about the goal of attracting and building relationships with the world&amp;#39;s sharpest women, you could be in the top 1% of that 1%. And no...that&amp;#39;s not an overstatement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So once again I&amp;#39;m going to appeal to your sense of ambition and greatness. I want you to BELIEVE you are capable AND ready to attract the highest quality women on Earth. And when you start putting into practice the &amp;quot;Big Four&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m so fond of harping on (confidence, ability to inspire confidence, character, and masculinity) you will indeed start seeing phenomenal occurrences on first and second dates. Some would call it supernatural, even&lt;br /&gt;
