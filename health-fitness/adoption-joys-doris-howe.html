  <title>Adoption Joys - Doris Howe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The softer side of the abortion debate  In contrast to the front line war of words that emanate with most protest views, Doris takes us behind the scenes into real life drama. The stories contained in this book will make you smile, cry, and find a place in your heart for hurting people that are usually blurred out of the media headlines. As a Pastor, I appreciate the caring way she approaches the issues and the caring hands that she reaches out with to touch hurting hearts. 
Pastor Rudy Bond

Doris has gathered a treasury of hope and joy surrounding the adoption process, including Scriptural encouragement and honesty about the fears and challenges involved. This book is a testament to the hand of God with even the least of these. 
Sara Maynard is a Texas attorney, specializing in representing children. She is Board Certified in Juvenile Law. 
ADOPTION JOYS, THEY EXPECTED A MIRACLE, explains Gods plan for unplanned pregnancies through moving testimonies of families who have experienced the joy of adoption. As the mother of two adopted children and one adopted grandson, I found myself rejoicing with the families through their stories. This book will be an effective tool to encourage couples to consider adopting children to complete their family. Birth parents will also understand the joy their baby will bring to the adoptive couple; and, perhaps, cause them to consider releasing their baby for adoption. God patterned adoption by adopting us into His family through His Son Jesus hrist. May this book challenge birth and adoptive parents to allow children to experience Gods unconditional love through the gift of adoption.
