  <title>How to Build an Enduring Marriage Teacher&#39;s Manual - Karen Budzinski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If asked to list the most important things in life, most people would not list their material possessions over their relationships. Although relationships are as varied as the people involved, the tools we utilize to build and strengthen them are always the same. This Teachers Manual will assist you in teaching the tools to enjoy marathon relationships as contained in the book &lt;i&gt;How to Build an Enduring Marriage&lt;/i&gt;, and its companion workbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid common obstacles that hinder successful communication&lt;br&gt;
Identify destructive habits that are eating away at marital happiness&lt;br&gt;
Prepare to get through problems without danger or injury to your relationship&lt;br&gt;
Achieve true intimacy, love, and friendship with your husband&lt;br&gt;
Hold onto joy through the ups and downs of life together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your marriage cannot work unless you do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to invite you to take a journey with me while we study and apply ourselves to live out our priorities. It is a journey designed to leave excuses behind as we apply ourselves to an extreme relationship workout. We are going to lift the ideals we have settled for in our relationships to new standards, set aside pre-conceived ideas, commit to develop and apply new skills, and take a look at some of the priorities we have unintentionally allowed to slacken. As we dedicate ourselves to these tasks, results will follow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
