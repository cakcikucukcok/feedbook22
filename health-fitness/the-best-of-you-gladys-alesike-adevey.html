  <title>The Best of You - Gladys Alesike Adevey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gladys has over ten years experience in marketing, sales, and customer service, which has enabled her to achieve the highest sales in Hewlett Packard (hp) 1st Launch Photo Smart Kiosk in London. She received her diploma in psychology with distinction; she has a BSc in accounting, MSc in business management, and a Prince2 Project Management Practitioner Certificate.
She is a member of the Association of Project Management and the Chartered Management Institute.
She is a project manager and currently working with the Institute of Consulting on how the Olympic Legacy might be used to stimulate economic growth and social well-being in the UK.
Gladyss experience in the Market Place, Profit Organisation and Non-Profit Organisation makes her uniquely gifted to teach people that becoming the best they can be is far more possible than they think.
The Best of You teaches you to understand a more meaningful way of living a purposeful life. It helps you attain the power to recognize that you do not always need to have resources before you become the best of you. 
The Best of You motivates you to start making commitments and teaches and encourages you that wherever you are in the journey of your life, you have a choice of making it beautiful and the ability to have a more constructive mental power.
Do you just spend years hurt, wondering in silence what life has for you?
Are you scared of a fresh start or know what you want but do not know how to get it?
Do you just live and grow and accept what life throws at you?
NOTE
Your choices today determine your tomorrow and you make your life through the power of choice.
(Kathy Smith)
We change the world not by what we say or do, but as consequence of what we have become.
