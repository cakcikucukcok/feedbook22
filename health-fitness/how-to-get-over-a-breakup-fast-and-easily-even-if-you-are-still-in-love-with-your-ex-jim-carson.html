  <title>How to Get Over a Breakup Fast and Easily- Even if You are Still in Love With Your Ex - Jim Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Do you believe it when people say getting over breakups is one of the hardest things in life? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Do you feel lost without the person you recently broke up with? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Do you wish there was an easy way to feel better?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Countless people just like you have experienced the heartache that accompanies the loss of a relationship. Getting over breakups is never without its ups and downs - but there are things you can do to make the process a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know how it feels to go through a breakup depression. You feel really hurt and numb inside, you don&amp;#39;t feel like doing anything and somehow life seems to have very little meaning besides eating, drinking, and sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still, just like having a bad cold or fever, please remember that this too shall pass. And the only thing you can and need to do right now is to do the best you can to be good and kind to yourself, as you move into and through the pain of losing someone you love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your heart will mend and heal. It&amp;#39;s one of the wonders of the human spirit. And you truly will feel more human and alive as a result of going through this emotional experience. I guarantee it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, to help you with &amp;#39;how to &lt;b&gt;get over breakup&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;depression &lt;/b&gt;and move on with your life&amp;#39;, here is a &lt;b&gt;new book&lt;/b&gt; that will help you overcome any breakup and&lt;b&gt; become happy once more&lt;/b&gt;" />
