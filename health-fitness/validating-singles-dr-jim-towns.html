      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;VALIDATING SINGLES is an essential guide to healthy single life that is based in profound biblical truth and can revolutionize the churchs understanding in affirming singleness.

This book has developed such a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are single and Christian, you face certain problems that come with the territory such as frustration in identity, sexuality, and professionally. You may feel a wilted identity amid a landscape of happy successful couples. If so, you will be pleased with this workcrammed full with pragmatic ideas, deep-felt experience and nuggets of spiritual insights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has a plan for your singleness. You are not single just to bide time until the day you get married. Amidst extremes of celibacy versus marriage in Christian culture, there is todays proliferation of sexual non-commitment and a biblical stance. Whether you have a temporary or permanent gift of singleness, God wants you to discover fulfillment while you are single. Validating Singles presents strategies for living as a single. This insightful book will help you, whether never married, widowed, or divorced, to understand Gods desires and plans for your life as a single. &lt;/p&gt;" />
