  <title>Circumstances - Bj Binning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Circumstances is a book about choices, families, relationships, a mother, a child, a husband and a wife. It asks the ultimate question: Are you happy with your choices in life and the circumstances that those choices have allowed?  As a child, Bella is beautiful shy and emotionally abused. She endures a childhood that presents many unfortunate events which she would not wish on anyone.  One day she realizes that she needs to make a choice and she does------the choice to embrace her circumstances and take the lessons learned with her to the next stage of life. You can make a choice to live with your circumstances or just do nothing and wither away!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because of her acceptance of her past, she becomes a force to be reckoned with.  She starts out losing one of the most precious people in her life----her father, and still yearns for that father-daughter relationship.  Decades later, she repeats her mothers life and then comes to the realization that she made her own choices which brought these circumstances. She chooses to live with them, to accept them for what they are and to use them as a basis for her future." />
