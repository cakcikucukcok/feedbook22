  <title>Unlatched - Jennifer Grayson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From an environmental journalist and mother of two young breast-fed children comes this searing, insightful look into the breastfeeding controversy and puts &amp;#8220;common knowledge&amp;#8221; about this most natural of processes to the test by breaking down the complex cultural, corporate, political, and technological factors that have transformed the way people think about breastfeeding and the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the rise of infant formula in the early twentieth century, breastfeeding has gone from a basic biological function to a never-ending controversy and hot topic in the media: an Instagram photo of Blake Lively breastfeeding her daughter gained 367,000 likes and was posted across media sites from &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Us Weekly&lt;/em&gt;. A photo of an Argentinian politician breastfeeding her 8-month-old during a session of Parliament quickly went viral, drawing a mix of support and criticism. Target&amp;#8217;s breastfeeding policy, allowing women to nurse in any area of the store, was recently shared on Facebook to praise from mothers across America. Clearly, this is a topic that constantly makes headlines and sparks heated discussion throughout the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Growing up, Jennifer Grayson thought nothing of the fact that her mother had not breastfed her. It wasn&amp;#8217;t until she became a mother herself that she realized she had missed out on a natural, profound, and incredibly important experience, one that she became determined to give to her own children. Her curiosity about breastfeeding soon turned to passion, leading her to launch a worldwide search for knowledge and stories of breastfeeding. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From biblical times to eighteenth century France, from modern-day Mongolia to inner-city Los Angeles, Grayson explores the personal stories of breastfeeding women throughout history around the world. Along the way, she takes readers behind the scenes at a lactation research laboratory, interviews controversial breastfeeding figures including Dr. William Sears, and shares her own personal experience of extended breastfeeding her preschool and toddler daughters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlatched &lt;/em&gt;is a thorough and fascinating study of one of the most contentious issues affecting society today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
