  <title>Neddy and Little Roy Go to Town - Brian D. Brookover, Dani Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Neddy is a small but precocious seven year old who wears sunglasses due to his light sensitive eyes.  He and his larger than average size twelve year old cousin, Little Roy, are best friends who enjoy adventures together in their idyllic hometown.  On a sunny day in May, they take a walk through downtown in order to mail a package containing a birthday present for Neddys grandmother. But when Neddy and Little Roy arrive at the post office they find that they have lost the package and have no idea how to locate it. Fortunately for the boys, one of the leading ladies of the town, Mrs. Mamie Mercer, comes to their rescue. The town is nearly turned upside down when Neddy and Little Roy, aided by Mrs. Mercer and friends, search for the missing package but during their adventure, the boys learn the importance of responsibility, teamwork and perseverance." />
