  <title>The Healing Power of Doing Good - Peggy Payne, Allan Luks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom has always held that when we help others, some of the good we do flows back to us. That satisfaction has always been thought to be largely emotionalfeeling good when you do good. Now important, widely discussed research shows that helping others regularly produces significant health benefits as wellin fact, it has effects similar to those many of us experience when we exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost impossible to read this book without wanting to do good. Both for those who are already volunteering and for those who are considering it, this valuable personal guide tells you how to choose an activity thats right for you, how to maximize the health benefits, and how to overcome the main obstacle to getting started: lack of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Healing Power of Doing Good&lt;/i&gt; reaffirms and explains that when we care for others we care for ourselves. It is an important book for those suffering from chronic health problems as well as the health conscious, anyone interested in how our mind affects our body, and people in the helping professions. And it reminds us that never has there been such a need for caring as there is today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
