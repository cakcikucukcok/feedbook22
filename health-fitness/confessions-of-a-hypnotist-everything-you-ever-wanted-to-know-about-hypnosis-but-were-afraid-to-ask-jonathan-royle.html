  <title>Confessions of a Hypnotist: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Hypnosis but Were Afraid to Ask - Jonathan Royle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CONFESSIONS OF A HYPNOTIST by Top Television &amp; Media Hypnotist and International Celebrity Mind Therapist Dr. Jonathan Royle  BSc is subtitled: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Hypnosis But Were Afraid to Ask and the title pretty much says it all.
For many years now most Industry Experts have regarded Hypnotherapy by Dave Elman as the Handbook for Hypnotherapists and anything by Ormond McGill as must study reading for Stage Hypnotists, However at long last that has all now changed with the release of Confessions of a Hypnotist by Dr. Jonathan Royle - BSc
This encyclopaedic course available in both Hard Back and Paper Back formats is an amazing compilation of many of Royles Ebooks including The Professional Art of Stage Hypnosis, Hypnotherapy &amp; Complete Mind Therapy  - The Lazy Mans Guide To Stage Hypnotism  Make A Million From Hypnotherapy  Hypnotising Animals for Fun and Profits  Hypno-Tricks How To Be an Instant Hypnotist  Theres No Such Thing As Hypnosis and many others!
Not only have all of Royles previous works been compiled into one volume, but all of the information has been completely updated and extensively added to making this without doubt the most comprehensive Home Study Training Course on all areas of the Hypnotic Industry ever written or released to the general public.
Indeed many of the Secrets, Ploys, Methods &amp; techniques revealed within the pages of this course have never appeared in print or any other form of training course before, indeed they have been jealously guarded by the Most Successful hypnotists for years, but here for the first time Royle has decided to lift the lid and reveal the True Secrets of Hypnotic Success which can change your life and your clients life forever!
To detail all of the mind-blowing secrets, ploys. And tried, tested and proven to work in the real world of Hypnosis &amp; NLP techniques that this combined course contains would take hours, so here are just a few brief examples of the contents:  
A brief example of the Hypnotherapy, NLP &amp; CMT Contents:
	What hypnosis is about and how it works.
* How the human mind works.
* Rapport, observation, recognition, and leadership skills. 
* Principles of verbal, physical and reverse psychology.
* Hypnotherapy, Advanced Hypnotherapy, Hypno-Analysis and Creative Visualisation.
* Inductions for the consulting room
* Standard phrases for hypnotic inductions and how to deepen the hypnotic trance. 
* How to identify the trance states and awaken clients. 
* How to deal with abreactions and hard to awaken subjects.
* Hypnotherapy scripts for stopping smoking, weight loss, skin problems, and confidence building.
* Psychotherapy and how to tackle advanced problems such as acute depression and sexual problems.
* The use of hypnosis for past life regression.
* Shortcuts to alternative medicine.
* How to increase your hypnotherapy business and income.
* How to earn money from stress management and motivational training.
* The Fast Phobia Cure Treatment Known as Neuro Associative Conditioning (NAC)
* The Complete Mind Therapy (CMT) session structure. 
Many people have gone on to become successful hypnotherapists after taking this course. Take this opportunity and you too can enter this wonderful and rewarding occupation.
&quot;Thanks for the training, which was excellent value for money and has provided me with a career for life which I enjoy immensely!&quot;
