  <title>Love Me - Donna Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive written this special little book as a place that will guide your feminine self to be more confident and to live an empowered life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were living in a world driven by business, and its often difficult to slow down to love yourself and nurture your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling with anorexia and depression, I was slowly recovering to repair and restore my brokenness, and I am sharing what I now know to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have forgotten how truly awesome you are, then the words contained in this book will help you remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is required is that you tell yourself how amazing you are, and to help you out, I have placed in my book a short heartfelt story and positive affirmations you can say to yourself each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be confident in your own skin, to feel more alive, then talk to yourself with love and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesnt cost anything to say nice things about yourself, and your body, mind, heart, and spirit will heal as a result of you spending a few minutes each day speaking with compassion and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do this, new doors will open up for you, new possibilities will arise, and you will discover whatever you need is already within you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am nurturing my inner child. She frequently wants to come out and play, and when she does, I love her and her childlike ways. She is beautiful, and she teaches me what I need to know.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;You have ancient knowledge of wisdom inside of you, and your heart is ready to hear your soft and gentle voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to spend as little as twenty minutes a day, expressing my powerful words to ignite the little child within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that you are loved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
