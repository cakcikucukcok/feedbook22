  <title>5:2 Vegetarian - Celia Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 5:2 Diet, also known as The Fast Diet, is gaining momentum worldwide as thousands of people who try it see how effective it is for weight loss and improving their general well-being. Many books about the diet focus on fish and meat and ignore the fact that as a vegetarian you are perfectly placed to follow the diet with amazing low-calorie vegetables. This book makes fast days interesting, fun and painless. Everything here is nutritious and vegetarian, with many vegan-friendly recipes. Most recipes are also gluten-free. The fast-day meal recipes are all super quick (30 minutes or less), accessible, satisfying, and nutrient-rich, yet all under 300 calories. If youre cooking for non-fasters, there are suggestions for multiplying and bulking out the meals for family members. With an introduction to the 5:2 lifestyle, advice on how to stock your kitchen, and easy and delicious fast-day recipes for breakfast, snacks, main meals, flavour bombs, drinks, weekly meal planners, calorie charts and plenty of fasting tips, this is the book to change your life, for good." />
