  <title>Rock Hard - JoZie Di Maria</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If there&#39;s one woman who rocks harder than anyone it&#39;s JoZie DiMaria. Gorgeous, outrageously fit and heavily tattooed, DiMaria has worked as a dancer with - and a trainer for - some of the biggest names in rock music. Having toured with legendary bands like Mötley Crüe, Papa Roach and Jane&#39;s Addiction, she has lived a life that most people could only dream of. &lt;br&gt;But DiMaria soon found that staying in top shape on the road was tough; performing long shows at packed stadiums late into the night, combined with endless hotel stays, poor nutrition and constant partying was gruelling. So DiMaria decided to take control and develop her own fierce fitness routine so that she could rock hard and train hard at the same time. &lt;br&gt;Rock Hard: A Backstage Pass to Staying Fit on the Road the Rockstar Way is both an outstanding fitness guide and a nostalgic behind the scenes account of JoZie DiMaria&#39;s incredible life on the road, training rockstars from Tommy Lee (Mötley Crüe) to Billy Morrison (Billy Idol) and Josh Todd (Buckcherry). Her easy to follow routines prove that you can work out anytime, any place - airports, offices, hotels, no excuses! - building a strong and healthy physique, inside and out, while developing a positive approach to body image. Beautiful paintings of her rockstar gym buddies accompany hand-drawn illustrations of work out moves, making it easy and lots of fun to train along with her, DiMaria&#39;s Rock Hard is a fitness book worthy of any rock God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
