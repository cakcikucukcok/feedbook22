  <title>Creating Balance - Alene Baronian, Kiley Field</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Balance: A Self-Reflective Book to Bring More Energy, Productivity, and Balance Into Your Life&lt;/em&gt; consists of eight chapters covering motivation, nutrition, planning/purchasing/preparation, exercise, stress, mindfulness, sleep and goal setting. As you progress through the chapters, you begin to understand where you are and how, if needed, you can improve that aspect of your health. Most chapters have journal entries to help you reflect on that topic on ways you can improve based on where you are. For each individual, that will differ. Where you are may differ from other readers and that&amp;rsquo;s where you can customize this book for yourself. This book is not about perfection. It&amp;rsquo;s about improvement, even if it&amp;rsquo;s the tiniest bit. That tiniest bit will help you in ways that you may not be able to see because there is no lab work, scale or assessment. However, over time, those tiny changes become bigger and will make a positive impact on your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend that you complete this book one chapter at a time. You may think that you&amp;rsquo;re doing well with one aspect of health, but after completing that chapter, you may be surprised to find that you have room to improve. Remember, we are all a work in progress, and Creating Balance gives you tools to simplify that effort. We hope you enjoy working on your health and creating healthy habits. We look forward to hearing your health success stories.&lt;/p&gt;" />
