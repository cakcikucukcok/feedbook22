  <title>Marriage Beyond the Bed - Paula Artis, Tommie Artis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marriage is a beautiful thing. The purpose of this book is to show and encourage the readers. After the wonderful wedding day and the honeymoon is over, the couple have to be willing to invest in each other to enjoy marriage beyond the bed.
We must always remember that in a relationship, we both bring fears, insecurities, and baggage from our cultures and environment. We must leave these things in the past and move forward to unite to become one. Every marriage will have disagreements, challenges, and difficulties. This is part of the process to help us communicate effectively and grow with understanding.
Everything in life is secured by its foundation; marriage is no exception. Your foundation must be built to support your marriage as a lifetime investment. There are different forms of communication; choose what is best for you and your spouse. There must be a determination between both partners; this is their lifetime commitment, and they must refuse to allow anything or anyone to separate them.
Each one must have something to bring to the table. Acknowledge your expectations for each other, work hard to do your part, and your marriage will last beyond the bed and the honeymoon.
Tommie and Paula encourage you to rekindle the marriage flame and keep it burning hot. You can love and be loved again. You can begin again!" />
