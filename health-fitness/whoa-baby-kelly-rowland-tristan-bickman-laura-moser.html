  <title>Whoa, Baby! - Kelly Rowland, Tristan Bickman, Laura Moser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;When global pop star Kelly Rowland became a mom for the first time, giving birth to her son Titan, she felt the most incredible love she had ever experienced. But after spending nine months so focused on the baby growing inside her, she was caught completely off guard by how much she had changed. Like many first-time moms, she was not ready for what had happened to her body and for so many overwhelming new thoughts and emotions. She wondered:&lt;i&gt; Will I Ever Walk Again? Will I Ever Sleep Again? Are My Boobs Always Going to Be Like This?&lt;/i&gt; Rowland had questions about everything from postpartum bleeding, skin and hair changes, and dealing with aches and pains to getting back in shape and sex after baby. She also weighed the larger notions about what she wanted out of motherhood and the rest of her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a good thing that Rowland&#39;s longtime OB/GYN Dr. Tristan Emily Bickman was right there to answer every single crazy question that popped into her head. Nothing fazed Dr. Bickman and she provided Rowland with the answers she so desperately needed, telling her over and over that, in the months after a woman gives birth, nothing is exactly strange, but nothing is necessarily normal either. It&#39;s all just part of the &quot;miracle&quot; of birth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Whoa, Baby!&lt;/i&gt; Rowland and Dr. Bickman team up to share this reassuring information with new moms everywhere. Often hilarious and always down-to-earth, Rowland and Dr. Bickman cover every surprising challenge that new moms face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
