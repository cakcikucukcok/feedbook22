  <title>The Stranger in My Bed - Patricia Marie Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;South Lyon was a tiny, quaint town where everyone knew everyone else and their business. So what went on behind closed doors stayed behind closed doors. Author Patricia Garcia was a terrible student. She had a very hard time grasping what the teacher was trying to get across to her in class. When she entered high school, that was the very worst time for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tried very hard, but she just could not take it in. She struggled through high school. When it was time for her to graduate, she was not sure she was going to make it. Her father was so angry at her that he sent her mom over to talk to the principal, to see if she was indeed going to graduate. Her mom was told she would graduate but not by much. The abuse started, and you will see just how she lived through it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Her childhood was the beginning of all of the abuse she endured and how she finally broke the cycle of hurt. &lt;/p&gt;" />
