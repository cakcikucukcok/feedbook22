  <title>Enlightenment Through Entitlement - Nicolas Vale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book is an evolving theory about the human condition and the true nature of reality.  The theory states the laws of human energy dynamics that include the premise that all human stress, depression, anxiety, and conflict come from the perceived unfair or unequal exchange of human energy.  The theory put forth utilizes the laws of physics from the physical realm and translates these same laws into human beings and human behavior.  The theory clearly states that all human behavior is one hundred percent defensive, protective, selfish, self-centered, self-serving and is done so the human in question can avoid, relieve, reduce, or eliminate all forms of conceivable human suffering (self-destructive and suicidal behavior explained).  The more we feel threatened and consequently suffer, the more selfish we become.  There are no such things as selflessness, sacrifice, martyrs, or heroes because everything a person does or thinks about himself or herself has the subconscious and/or conscious goal of relieving suffering.  Everything is a defense against suffering.  The theory/philosophy presented in this book explains why people act the way they do, and why life is a brutal, fierce competition for scarce, finite, ultimately impersonal, ultimately impartial, and ultimately neutral human energy.  All inevitable stress and conflict come from the entitlement people feel for this powerful invisible force (human energy), and there just isnt enough to go around to satisfy each persons unique entitlement issues.  Even though this book talks about an inherent order to human beings with regards to energy, it is a very spiritual book meant to help people make sense of their lives and take the mystery out of why things happen they way they do.  Once the reader becomes enlightened (aware) to the true nature of reality, only then can the human species evolve to a place where we can talk about what we are experiencing here on earth accurately.  The final frontier for mankind is not outer space as many people will have you think.  The final frontier is the acceptance of a hierarchical structure to mankind, selfishness, self-interest and entitlement as a truth and a natural, normal part of human existence.  The theories presented in this book will change the way you view reality forever.  It is to your advantage to understand reality.  This book is where science, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and spirituality overlap. &lt;/P&gt;" />
