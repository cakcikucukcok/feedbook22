This is the main reason why coconut oil is considered for so many medical conditions especially in the treatment of diabetes. In a person with diabetes, the body is unable to utilize sugar which is used for energy due to a decrease (or total lack of) insulin. Insulin is secreted by the pancreas and it helps move sugar that is derived from foods, and transports it into cells for energy.
