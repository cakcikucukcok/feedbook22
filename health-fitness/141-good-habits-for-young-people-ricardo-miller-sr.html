      <meta name="description" content="You were born to lead and designed to win in life, but in order to win you must decide to win. Life is grafted with principles and laws that govern the world. If you follow those principles, you can win. 
What you see and hear becomes what you continue to ponder and process all day. These become your dominant thoughts, the focus of your creative capacity and thus continuing reality. Unfortunately, your friends and family are tuned into the same channels, so your conversations propagate and reinforce these attitudes. 
This book was written for those who want to be achievers.; to do more, grow, learn, be better and live richer and fuller lives.
These principles have changed my life and the life of hundreds of children I have ministered to over the years." />
