  <title>Imagining and the Transformation of Man - Neville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If one is looking for answers to the meaning of life and how to make a happier, richer existence (e.g., relationships, finances, health), then Nevilles teaching from personal experience, testimonies from students, and his amazing visions paralleling and explaining the mysteries of the Old and New Testament will answer those questions.
Learn his techniques, unleash your power to create, believe in your imaginary acts, and no power in this world can stop the desired results from appearing in your world. Its the only creative power, one that everyone is operating moment to moment. Learning how to direct it deliberately is essential to producing loving, positive changes in ones life.
These 1963 lectures also begin a nine-year odyssey of discovering the deepest meanings of six visions of the end that had unfolded in Neville (19591963). The visions are the signs that this long journey as limited man; the terrible opacity and contraction is over, that the purpose of human life has been completed; man has endured and overcome six thousand years of amnesia plus the fires of experience and has emerged victorious. Hes been transformed by his inner being (I Am or God) back into the divinity he truly is and always was." />
