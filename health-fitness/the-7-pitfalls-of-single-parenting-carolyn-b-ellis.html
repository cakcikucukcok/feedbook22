  <title>The 7 Pitfalls of Single Parenting - Carolyn B. Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content=",P.Life and love can take unexpected turns, and &lt;i&gt;The 7 Pitfalls of Single Parenting&lt;/i&gt; offers hope and clear guidance for its readers. Building authentic, loving relationships is the greatest gift we can give our children, and this important book shows you how to do just that.&lt;br&gt;
Barbara De Angelis, Ph.D., #1 New York Times Best-Selling Author&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that divorce takes a toll on children. Often caught in the crossfire between parents who are hurt, angry, and devastated, children unwittingly become the victims of toxic emotional overload. In her simple yet powerful guidebook for single parents, divorce coach Carolyn Ellis offers practical, innovative advice on how parents concerned about the impact of divorce on their children can avoid the seven most common single parenting mistakes, ultimately helping their children thrive after a marriage ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from her own experiences as a single mother of three children, interviews with other single parents and divorce experts, and in-depth studies on personal development, Ellis provides insights and tools that illustrate to parents how their children can flourish after divorce. By identifying the seven self-defeating pitfalls that often occur in the aftermath of divorce, Ellis encourages parents to put the needs of their children first, teaches how not to parent from guilt, and shares practical ways to avoid living in chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explained with compassion, humor, and wisdom, &lt;i&gt;The 7 Pitfalls of Single Parenting&lt;/i&gt; guides divorced parents to find their own path in life, develop parenting resilience, and, in the end, improve the emotional health and well-being of their children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
