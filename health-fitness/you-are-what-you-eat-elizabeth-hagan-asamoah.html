  <title>You Are What You Eat - Elizabeth Hagan Asamoah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Words and images just like nutrients have the potential to impact the well-being of an individual positively or negatively, based on the type of words or images a person keeps feeding themselves with. The self-esteem, confidence, spirituality, morality, and physical and emotional health of an individual are highly influenced by the kind of information one feeds on. Through the words of our mouth, we can create our own worlds and dictate the direction we want our lives to go. Words are said to have spirit and are alive, so we must be very careful how we use them. There is life and death in the power of the tongue. 
You Are What You Eat: The Power of Words and Images was written for all ages, but especially for the youth, those in their formative years, adolescents, and young adults, and even young parents. The book addresses some interesting topics like the following: 
Positive and negative confessions 
The impact of spoken words on our destinies 
Dealing with verbal abuse 
Look out for Elizabeth Hagan Asamoahs first fiction, The Taboo." />
