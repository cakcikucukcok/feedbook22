Leah Kobzan grew up the youngest of five in an interesting family dynamic and endured an emotional and physical burden living with an auto-immune disorder, specifically Crohn&amp;#39;s disease.

Constant medical appointments, never-ending tests and procedures, and attempting a completely alternate route to better her life and cope with her illness led to a new path. Being labeled disabled and attempting an approach not recommended by our routine medical professionals she faced off against the unknown.

Growing up she had a normal childhood with many ups and downs like most people, but the entire time Leah was unaware what was happening and worsening inside her body. Experiencing pain started from a young age and consistently masked every symptom, so while not having the knowledge to seek medical attention unfortunately resulted in her health deteriorating for many years.&lt;br /&gt; Leah lives her life feeling a connection to those who are facing medical intervention and treatment or in those who are trying to understand and manage their everyday pain. She empathizes with those who struggle to find the motivation in wanting to make healthier choices and improve their personal life; we are all connected in some way and Leah feels there is compassion, hope and insight through each one of our personal stories. She has met many people who are suffering and we all have unique journeys, some that are through living with illness. Share in Leah Kobzan&amp;#39;s experiences and what is has taken to live well with Crohn&amp;#39;s disease and ultimately be happy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
