  <title>Be Loved for Who You Really Are - Judith Sherven, James Ph.D. Sniechowski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Based on their 14 years together as relationship trainers working with over 100,000 singles and couples, Judith Sherven and James Sniechowski have developed a truly new and original way to approach relationships. &lt;i&gt;Be Loved for Who You Really Are&lt;/i&gt; describes how differences between partners can be a source of understanding and intimacy, enhancing rather than destroying a relationship. Readers learn to recognize the process of understanding differences, and what is necessary to keep lovemaking and romance alive for a lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be Loved for Who You Really Are&lt;/i&gt; outlines a natural and predictable path that love requires, called the arc of love. Within this arc are four inevitable passages that enable the reader to better understand the challenges and pitfalls they will encounter, and to not confuse conflicts and tough times with disaster or failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of a &quot;passage&quot; is used because as love evolves between two people it requires that they face into and grow through a number of challenges. Those challenges are necessary for them to mature in the wisdom of their love and intimacy and in the day-to-day relationship they are co-creating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four passages are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*A Glimpse of What Is Possible, the wonderful time of falling in love when you actually see the perfection of your partner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The Clash of Differences, when your love is tested through the inevitable conflicts that emerge from your differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The Magic of Differences, when those very same differences allow you to be respected and loved for the person you truly are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*And The Grace of Deep Intimacy, when the passionate wonder of the beginning is now yours, through and through, and your love touches everyone you encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most relationship books, which are written primarily for women, &lt;i&gt;Be Loved for Who You Really Are&lt;/i&gt; speaks to women and men equally. Judith &amp; Jim underscore the fact that men are just as hungry for this kind of life-changing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout &lt;i&gt;Be Loved for Who You Really Are&lt;/i&gt;, Judith and Jim provide inspiring examples that show how love lives between people, and that differences can actually be the key to the deepest connection being together has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
