  <title>God Has a Plan - Shirley Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I believe this book declares what is happening in the spirit realm to activate the &quot;spiritual antenna&quot; of those in and outside the churches, and how God will gather His people together and pour out His Holy Spirit upon them to do His Will, in His Way. God wants an &#39;army&#39; of ordinary people to play their part in His Final Battle for Souls. Security in God is vital, as is Faith to keep following Jesus -without being deceived and growing cold towards God. God wants to release His people into a SECOND ACT OF JESUS&#39; RESURRECTION POWER to do His amazing works of Grace and Mercy.  He wants us to be aware of the spiritual signs, which will continue to increase prior to Jesus&#39; return, so that we are ready for when He does RETURN for HIS SPOTLESS BRIDE HIS CHURCH!  Therefore, God wants us to STOP and LISTEN to Him!
Personally, God has spoken to me since 1991 regarding &quot;The Final Battle&quot; and has gradually revealed more and more of His plans, but I firmly believe there is very much more revelation to be received by God&#39;s people and that this is only just the very beginning. The purpose of these revelations is to give vision and to give spiritual insight into the days and times in which we now live.  It is to inform all people about the urgency of these times by alerting their spiritual reception to what God is planning to do in the coming days.
In order for people to understand these times they will need to allow God to &quot;give birth&quot; in their hearts to HOPE, FAITH, LOVE, COMPASSION and VISION with an EXPECTANCY that God will do ALL that He says He will do.  My prayer is that these revelations will encourage and give assurance of GOD&#39;s LOVE for ALL PEOPLE and, also, give warnings and opportunities to others to receive JESUS, GOD&#39;S ONLY SON, as their SAVIOUR and LORD.  Therefore, this book is a LETTER from GOD&#39;S HEART addressed to those who:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
	KNOW JESUS, who have been born of His Holy Spirit and are seeking to put His will first in their lives.
&lt;br&gt;	HAVE KNOWN JESUS, but have lost contact with Him through disappointments, disillusionments, pain, hurt, rejection etc.
&lt;br&gt;	HAVE KNOWN JESUS but who have fallen prey to lethargy and comfort, having been deceived that following Jesus means only to follow Him and live in the blessings (the good times), and not following Him in the &quot;crucifixion&quot; times (faith-building times), for during these times character growth and maturity can take place.
&lt;br&gt;	HAVE KNOWN JESUS, but have fallen asleep and have become &quot;spiritually dead&quot; no longer able to hear the voice of their Shepherd calling them to come to Him.
&lt;br&gt;	LEGALLY PRAISE HIM with their &quot;head&quot; and not with their &quot;heart&quot;, as they are missing the point, missing out on their personal relationship with Jesus and missing out on fulfilling their potential and purpose in Him.
&lt;br&gt;	HAVE HEARD ABOUT JESUS and believe in Him, and that He is the only Son of God, but do not see the need or urgency or relevance of receiving Him as Lord and Saviour of their lives.
&lt;br&gt;	HAVE NEVER HEARD ABOUT JESUS, and about the Good News that was given to all mankind when Jesus died for ALL of our sins and arose from the dead on the third day, thereby being in a position of authority to remove ALL sin and opposition from the lives of all who will turn to Him in true repentance and with sincere regret for their wrong doings, however big or small, so that they can receive His Forgiveness and His Healing and Saving Love into their hearts and lives.
&lt;br&gt;	MAY BE either complacent, financially secure, poor and needy, sick and dying, abused physically, mentally, emotionally, sexually, or those who may be the perpetrators of this abuse, those who are desperate and despairing, longing and groaning for moral and upright attitudes within our Nations, for which problems and difficulties JESUS IS the only answer.
&lt;br&gt;	MAY BE plotting evil against those who follow Jesus, to turn from their course while there are still opportunities available to them.
