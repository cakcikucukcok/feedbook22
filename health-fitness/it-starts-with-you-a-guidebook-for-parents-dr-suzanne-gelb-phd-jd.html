  <title>It Starts With You—A Guidebook For Parents - Dr. Suzanne Gelb PhD Jd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;My daughter just won&amp;rsquo;t cooperate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The tantrums have gotten out of control.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;He promises to do his chores, but then he doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s having trouble making friends at her new high school.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying everything I can think of&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m at my wit&amp;rsquo;s end!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;re a parent, chances are you&amp;rsquo;ve made at least one of those statements during the past year &amp;mdash; or possibly something similar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Suzanne Gelb, PhD, JD, a psychologist and life coach who has worked with parents and families for 30+ years combined, and also an attorney who has worked in the area of family law, understands parents&amp;rsquo; frustrations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Year after year, she has heard stories about tough spots, melt-downs, tantrums, and just about every hair-pulling situation imaginable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two decades &amp;mdash; and more than a few transformational success stories &amp;mdash; into her career, Dr. Gelb has consolidated her knowledge into a guidebook for parents:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;IT STARTS WITH YOU.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book doesn&amp;rsquo;t outline a &amp;ldquo;revolutionary&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ground-breaking&amp;rdquo; parenting philosophy. Rather, just the opposite. It&amp;rsquo;s a refreshingly simple guidebook on how to raise great kids by setting a great example that your children would naturally want to follow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Dr. Gelb explains, &amp;quot;Parents set the tone for their household. If your child is acting out, first, it&amp;rsquo;s wise to look towards yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;IT STARTS WITH YOU&lt;/i&gt; urges parents to get back to basics &amp;mdash; starting with your words, your actions, your role modeling; the messages that you knowingly (and unknowingly) expose your child to, every day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Relatable stories about parents and children&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tips on how to set age-appropriate rules and consequences for children of all ages, including teenagers&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Worksheets to organize and track family chores and responsibilities&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Guidelines that can help you resolve dozens of tricky, sometimes uncomfortable scenarios (from public tantrums to curfew-breaking to texting at the dinner table to navigating major life events, like illness or divorce)&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inspiration to strengthen your mind, body, and life &amp;mdash;forgiving your own parents, releasing the past, becoming a stronger, more positive role model for your children: a family leader who&amp;rsquo;s worthy of admiration and respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Readers have called this book &amp;ldquo;game-changing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;incredibly effective,&amp;rdquo; and the message rippling through the pages of &lt;i&gt;IT STARTS WITH YOU&lt;/i&gt; is one of hope and empowerment:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It is never too late to become the person, parent, and role model that you want to be &amp;mdash; and that your child needs and deserves.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your child is looking to you and counting on you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It all starts with you.&lt;/b&gt;" />
