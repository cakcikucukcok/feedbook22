  <title>Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Think and Grow Rich&amp;quot; is probably the most famous success book of all time. It was written by Napoleon Hill in 1937 and has sold over 15 million copies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Think and Grow Rich&amp;quot; examines the psychological power of thought and the brain in the process of furthering your career for both monetary and personal satisfaction. This is one of the all-time self-help classics and a must read for investors and entrepreneurial types.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The premise of the book is simple:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Riches begin with a state of mind. If we want to get rich, we must first change our minds so that we become, as Napoleon Hill calls it, money conscious. He says that we must literally THINK ourselves rich. The term riches by the way could mean any form of wealth like money, happiness, healthy relationships, business success etc..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book offers the How-To of the aforementioned concept. It shows us how we must think to become money conscious. It shows us how to think ourselves rich, how to control our minds and our thoughts so that we can become rich." />
