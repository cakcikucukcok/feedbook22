  <title>Pregnancy Is a “Real Mother!” - Jeffrey L. Zweig Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Want a book that is more personal than other books on the subject?
Want a book on pregnancy that is easy to read?
Looking for a book that is a tell all about pregnancy?
Want to laugh and be amused by a book on pregnancy?
If so, Pregnancy a Real Mother is the book for you.
It is one of the most fascinating and captivating books published on the subject in over 20 years.
The title of the book says it all: a book with its own personality written by an Ob-Gyn who has delivered over 8,000 babies over 40 years of practice experience.
Dr. Zweigs goal in writing this book is to answer all the questions about pregnancy that are typically asked on a daily basis. The book starts out on the same journey of pregnancy that the expectant parents begin: from the positive pregnancy test to labor and delivery to newborn care. All the technical information is presented but this book is different from all other books on pregnancy with:
1. Over 100 pictures of patients and nurses during their pregnancy, labor and postpartum
2. Anecdotes of real events that are tied to the information being presented
3. Doses of humor to keep the reader smiling and giggling
You will enjoy reading the medical explanations of most of the Old Wives Tales near the end of the book. Old Wives Tales are followed by Old Obstetrician Tales: 25 separate stories of actual patients with different pregnancy-related situations. These real life stories will intrigue you, make you laugh, bring you tears of joy and make you think." />
