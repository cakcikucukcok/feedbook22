  <title>Universal Angel Star - Phyllis Charity</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am thirty-eight years old and the mother of three lovely boys.
I had my first major spiritual awakening in 2004 when I started to see orbs. I then made a connection with my angels and spirit guides, and my spiritual journey has progressed and deepened over the years.
I write inspirational poems from peoples Angels and loved ones in spirit.
I am a Reiki Master and offer Reiki workshops. This work has been an amazing journey for me on many levels.
I am now offering spiritual awareness workshops with a goal of helping others to connect more with their earth and spiritual journeys and to help them breakthrough the illusion of life 
The gift that I am always so grateful for is the energy shift photos. I work on the same principle as a trance Medium and use a normal digital camera. When doing readings or workshops, the client allows his or her loved ones energy to come through them and we see the loved ones face in the photo. This is very magical and blows me away every time I do these photos. I can never 100% guarantee we will get a result but normally we are very lucky and the universe gifts us with some magical and memorable experiences. Again my job is to help people break through the illusion of death, which is projected on planet Earth. The photos have helped many people deal with the grieving process and helped them heal on their journey. It will never replace their loved one, but many find peace and comfort in knowing their loved one is safe and well, sending them love and will always be by their side in spirit.
From doing the workshops we sometimes get photos of spirit guides and other Universal Energies, which is also a magical experience. What the people have experienced in their meditations throughout the day come through on the camera at the end of the workshop. This gives them more confidence and belief as others can see the magic as well in the photos.
 All of my work is based on my own life experiences." />
