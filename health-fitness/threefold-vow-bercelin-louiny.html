  <title>Threefold Vow - Bercelin Louiny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The subtitle A Marriage amid the Adversities of Life and Its Redemption suggests that Threefold Vow aims at marriage and family. However, the target audience of Threefold Vow is much wider. I am very confident that it will be a tremendous blessing, especially if you fall into these categories:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are struggling with an addiction. Perhaps you have tried many times to escape from that bondage, but unfortunately still find yourself ensnared by it.
Your marriage is on the brink of divorce, and you feel like there is no way out.
You are or were incarcerated and perhaps see no meaning to life.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dont fit in these categories, you will be reminded that the Prince of life is still in the business of speaking life into dead situations.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, if you were thinking of getting a copy of Threefold Vow, I urge you to do so. For God wants you to have an abundant life. Enjoy your reading!&lt;p&gt;" />
