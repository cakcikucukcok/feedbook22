The book illustrates how the communication tools that consumers use every day: digital records, email, the Internet, and smartphones are enabling technologies that help patients empower themselves to take charge of their health care, communicate with their clinicians, monitor their chronic conditions and collaborate with their health care team for better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 2014 update to the original 2011 edition reflects changes to the Affordable Care Act and underscores the breakneck pace of change in both healthcare and technology. It is a comprehensive, accurate and useful healthcare guide, chock full of statistics, surveys, anecdotal stories including a list of key points and documented sources that close each chapter. Kirkus Indie Review, June 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books eleven chapters cover everything from managing healthcare costs and records to understanding how preparing for a doctors visit has changed over the years and what your legal rights are as a self-advocating patient. The concepts in each chapter are introduced and reinforced with real-life stories that are appropriately suited to each topic. These illustrative stories make the concepts memorable and empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
