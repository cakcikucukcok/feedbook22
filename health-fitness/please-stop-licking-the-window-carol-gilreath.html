  <title>Please Stop Licking the Window - Carol Gilreath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book describes the difficulties a family encounters as they live through a heartrending journey with a son who has chosen a life of addiction. Many families will be able to relate to the scenarios within their own lives. It is written with an interesting twist of nursery rhymes revised to describe a young mans attempt at life. Don&#39;t be surprised to read that Cliff could jump over the moon or that the Son came down and washed the devil out. In this account of a familys attempt at normalcy, one realizes that a life guided by Christ will never be normal, because He specializes in the unbelievable. The faith of a mother, the grace of the Lord, and the undeniable hold of addiction are all rolled up in this story of a boy who always seems to be just beyond the window.&lt;/p&gt;" />
