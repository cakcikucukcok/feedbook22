  <title>Blueprints - Terry Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Blueprints is a book of poetry dealing with everyday emotions whether it&#39;s Love, relationships, breakups,and a host of other feelings that we as humans experience from time to time. Blueprints is only to show its readers that there is hope. No matter how bad a situation may seem, it can and will get better. Most poems in this book comes from my own experience and going through the life that I&#39;ve lived, letting my readers know that you are not alone. One of my favorite Poems in this book is Changes, and when you read it you will know why.
    The name Blueprints is self-explanitory. I chose this name because it forms a bond around everything written inside. We must blueprint our life now, otherwise in the future we will be left wondering how, when, or what happened. Blueprints can save a life from pain and unhappiness. Just as a house is built, there are Blueprints and a plan so that construction can begin on a solid foundation. That way when it&#39;s complete, or, &quot;At The Top&quot;, it&#39;s much harder to fall down because it was Blueprinted. Blueprint your life now as I have Blueprinted this book and remember. It&#39;s never too late.
    This book isn&#39;t to make it&#39;s readers distrust their Loved ones, but only to let the truth be told.
Everything happens for a reason so the book Blueprints is here to comfort its readers that have experienced the same thoughts and feelings as it&#39;s writer. I hope all  the readers of this book can understand the poems in it because they come directly from my heart, so I&#39;m sure someone somewhere will be helped. I ask that you enjoy this book and share it with your Loved ones and friends because Poetry is the backbone of books. So again, enjoy, and let the words flow through your heart just as they came from mine." />
