  <title>One Best Hike: Yosemite&#39;s Half Dome - Rick Deutsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This is the only guide for hiking to the top of Half Dome - the signature landmark of Yosemite National Park, CA. It provides a history of the original Indian inhabitants of the area. The unique geological formations are explained. The focus of the book is to provide information on safe hiking practices to complete this extremely strenuous hike of 16-miles round trip that is climaxed by a harrowing 400 foot vertical ascent to the top of the 8,842 foot high granite monolith with the aid of a pair or steel cable banisters set at 45 degrees incline. Included is an extensive trail description with photos and narration of 16 points of interest.&lt;BR&gt;   &lt;br&gt;The author has completed this hike over 30 times and is a recognized expert source of information about the hike. This is not a topographic map intensive guide; rather it tells historical vignettes to interpret the hike so readers identify with events of the mid 1800&amp;#8217;s. He relates the story of the interaction of the Miwok and Mono Paiute Indians with the hordes of white invaders during California&amp;#8217;s Gold Rush. The reader is aware of how Yosemite developed after the white man&amp;#8217;s &amp;#147;discovery.&amp;#8221;  The explanation of how odd geologic formations arose from ancient magma flows provides the reader with an understanding of what happened to the &amp;#147;missing part&amp;#8221; of Half Dome.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;br&gt;The full day hike up to the top of Half Dome is one of the most popular in the country. It is not easy. The book prepares the reader for the adventure with an extensive discussion of the equipment required, the training needed and a detailed &amp;#147;walk through&amp;#8221; of the entire trail. Photographs and descriptions of salient features take the apprehension out of doing the hike. Sections with descriptions of 16-Points of Interest &amp;#150; waterfalls, historical areas, flora and fauna, drinking water sources and the actual cables provide readers with the &amp;#147;real deal&amp;#8221; information to safely prepare for and complete this &amp;#147;bucket list&amp;#8221; Adventure. Readers are given specific information on the gear needed. This includes a boots/foot care, use of hiking poles and a summary of water filter usage clothing selection and food suggestions.&lt;/div&gt;" />
