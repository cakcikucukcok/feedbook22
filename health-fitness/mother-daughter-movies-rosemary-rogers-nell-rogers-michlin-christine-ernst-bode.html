  <title>Mother-Daughter Movies - Rosemary Rogers, Nell Rogers Michlin, Christine Ernst Bode</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nobody has a perfect mother. And, despite what some pushy moms would have us believe, nobody has a perfect daughter, either. It&#39;s sometimes hard to communicate with each other, but what can you do?  Should you turn to Dr. Phil, psychotropic drugs, a hit man? No! Here&#39;s the solution: It&#39;s so simple, so obvious, so painless---the movies!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on more than twenty years of watching movies together, real-life mother and daughter Rosemary Rogers and Nell Rogers Michlin offer plot synopses, cast reviews, and behind-the-scenes gossip for more than one hundred of their all-time-favorite movies, including invaluable ratings you won&#39;t find anywhere else, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Bonding Potential: Looking for serious mother-daughter time? Try one of their top picks, like Terms of Endearment, Freaky Friday, or The Joy Luck Club.&lt;br&gt;*Hunk Factor: Hannah and Her Sisters may only rate a 1 (Michael Caine and Woody Allen have other important qualities....), but School Ties, with a shirtless Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Brendan Fraser, gets a well-earned 10.&lt;br&gt;*Hankie Factor: Because sometimes we all need a good cry.&lt;br&gt;*Squirming in Your Seat Watching a Sex Scene with Your Mother/Daughter: Trust us, you&#39;ll want to know ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wise and witty, &lt;i&gt;Mother-Daughter Movies&lt;/i&gt; offers a fresh perspective on life&#39;s most important issues---from family conflict to surviving high school to understanding when tweezed eyebrows can totally change your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
