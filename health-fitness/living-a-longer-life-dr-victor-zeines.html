  <title>Living a Longer Life - Dr. Victor Zeines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are so many books out there telling us how to eat healthy, live longer, lose weight, and make yourself look ten years younger, that you can go dizzy browsing the shelves of your bookstore trying to figure out which one to buy. As both a holistic dentist and nutritionist for many years, thats one of the reasons why I decided to write this book; to help cut through all the confusion and offer readers a common sense guide to feeling great, looking great, losing weight, and adding years to their lives. This book will point you in the right direction. It is an easy-to-follow roadmap to achieving the excellent quality of life you desire, and is based on my own years of writing and lecturing about nutrition and dentistry. It also utilizes many of the concepts and courses offered at the Institute of Natural Dentistry which graduates some of the nations best holistic dentists. Let me add that all the alternative modalities mentioned in this book are perfectly safe. They are time-tested techniques that over the centuries have been proven to promote health and healing without any undo side effects. Of course, they should be used only in addition to your regular medical care." />
