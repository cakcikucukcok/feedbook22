  <title>Praise Dancing in the Rain in the Midst of My Life&#39;s Storm - Christola Deloris Witherspoon-Brayboy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Description
Praise Dancing In The Rain In The Midst Of My Lifes Storm, (Little Things Makes A Big Difference) is intended to be an easy and gentle read, yet strongly effective.  To you that read my book, I resign my liberty and I tell you my secrets. I will share with you the little things in my life that made a big difference.  I am sharing my secrets with you and it is my sincere hope that you will tell someone. There have always been a certain feeling of power attached to the keeping of my secrets along with reciprocal bonds between my secrecy and emotions.  Keeping my secrets made me an individual and now telling my secrets voluntarily forges a link with others and helps me become a better person. 
What you are about to read are secrets that I have jotted down in a journal, on sticky note or just carried around in my heart and head. My secret speaks of my hopes, dreams, love, gratitude and great passion for life. I share the stories of my lifes storms, my abilities over my disabilities, victory over defeat, advantages over disadvantages, and my desire to live a well live life over an unlived death. I am truly grateful and blessed from all the small things that made the big difference in my life. It is the experiences and learned lessons from the small things that I have learned how to praise dance in the rain until I can soar above my lifes storms.  The little things are enormously significant. Each time I experience something I write it down in my journal and I ask myself two questions; What have I learned from it, and how can I use what I have learned to immediately improve my life?  
 The content of this book is also the result of a quickening, energy and desire that translated from my heart through my head and now into this book. It offers inspiration, as well as spiritual, emotional and personal empowerment.  It speaks of daily occurrences in my life, real life situations with others, humor and scriptures. This book imparts a message that Life is full of ups and downs, trail and tribulations, and challenges and struggles, which are called the storms of life.  These storms presents opportunities, new levels of growth, new possibilities, wisdom, inner strength as well as  an  invitation for lips and heart to sing, arms to be spread as wings for soaring and feet to dance a graceful dance throughout the storm with the part of life that is stronger than the problem being faced.  
Every storm has a season and can be a result of Gods divine will as well as his permissive will. The storms in our lives provides the environment in which God  reveals himself  and where He wants us to learn to trust Him by taking Him at His Word.  God does not always send the storm; however he will allows us to go through them for growth. He wants us to dance in the rain and soar above our storms as eagles.  
The Bible declares in Isaiah 40:31: But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.(KJV).  
The eagle has long been a symbol of strength, power and majesty, they face storms fearlessly. They are of the few birds that do not fear or attempt to escape the storm.  They simply use the storm to lift them higher, they adjust their wings feathers for maximum altitude and they are able to fly high above the storm.  The eagles eyes are protected by a clear membrane that protects their vision, which allows them to see clearly as they fly at high speed and when they are in a storm. That is exactly what God wants our experiences in the storm to be.  God wants us to learn to face storms with vision instead of emotion.  He wants us to keep a clear vision and maintain the right perspective in our storms by letting our problems and challenges cause us to rise higher and higher. God wants us to envision victory over our storms.  Eagles are constantly cleaning their feathers, pulling out any that are ruffled or damage" />
