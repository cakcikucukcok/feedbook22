  <title>Hope for the Divorcee: Forgiven and Moving Forward - Angel Casiano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pastor Angel Casiano&amp;#39;s happy eighteen-year marriage ended when his beautiful wife died of cancer. Lonely and angry at God for his loss, he jumped into a second marriage. For the next two years, he was miserable and became a man he didn&amp;#39;t know or like. Then he found himself in a position he never thought would happen to him&amp;mdash;divorced.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The negative stigmatism of divorce within the Church made him question whether he had toppled into the abyss of unforgiveness. Was his life now over, and was he now condemned to go through the rest of his days alone because he made the mistake of marrying the wrong person? Did he dare to hope he could move on happily after divorce?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Join Casiano as he shares the good, the bad, and the ugly of his story, using complete transparency as he openly admits to his desires and sins committed in his journey to find happiness. Join him as he takes you into the Bible to hear what the God of the universe has to say on this controversial topic. Join him as he scripturally proves that there is indeed hope in the aftermath of divorce and that you too can live a joyful life, despite your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
