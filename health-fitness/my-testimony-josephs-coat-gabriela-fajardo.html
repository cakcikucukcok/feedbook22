  <title>My Testimony Josephs’ Coat - Gabriela Fajardo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book was inspired by my experiences as a Christian, and I pray it will be a blessing to you, the reader, in your walk with the Lamb of God, our Lord Jesus Christ. The book has things like dream experiences and visions, which I had in intense prayer and fasting. They have built my faith in God and in the reality of God, the supreme being. It is roughly up to date with my most powerful experiences. The Spirit of God is like living water, which does not get stuck in one place but rather is new every day. Also, I believe the longest chapter of my book is Chica from Heaven Major Downfalls, which I took my time to explain my current life situation and what I have gone through even though I have this amazing gift. Above all things, reader, I motivate you to keep on persevering in everything that is good and just (your goals and aspirations), because it eventually gives fruit and brings forth happiness and peace and an abundant life, which Jesus Christ promised we shall have in his kingdom. To him be all the glory and honor forever and ever. Amen." />
