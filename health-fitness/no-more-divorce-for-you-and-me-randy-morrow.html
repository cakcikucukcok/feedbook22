  <title>No More Divorce for You and Me - Randy Morrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a MUST READ Page if You Want to
Understand How the Book is Written&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this book not to be perfect but to
be helpful. The best way to understand the book
is to think of each chapter as an individual story
or lesson learned. In fact, the best way to use it
is to either a) just open up to a page; or b) look
at the index to find the subject for which you are
looking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing in this book is theory, I actually experienced
everything. I am one of those people who
failed their way forward in life until I finally
became the person of whom I am proud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have intentionally not gone into minute detail
because I want you to read it, think about it, and
come to your own conclusion(s). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who has written a book has always held
a place of awe with me. Because of my own experiences
and highly limited beliefs, it never dawned
on me that I could write a book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all changed when I came down with a dose
of cancer and started throwing off all the anchors
holding me as a person, down. All of a sudden the
book was just for me; it didnt have to look or feel
a certain way; and I didnt care if a single book
was ever sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to be an author! And here is the
result. I sincerely hope you enjoy and learn from
my own journey through the years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt; Experiences are good and bad, &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;just that. They are something&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;I went through, learned from, &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;and survived. However, by&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;sharing these experiences and&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;allowing people to learn from&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;them, I give them value. &lt;/center&gt;
