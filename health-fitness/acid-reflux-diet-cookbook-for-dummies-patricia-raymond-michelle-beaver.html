  <title>Acid Reflux Diet &amp; Cookbook For Dummies - Patricia Raymond, Michelle Beaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Get rid of GERD for good&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is your heartburn making you dread meal times? No matter how delicious a feast is before you, the prospect of that burning pain, nausea, and even vomiting can be enough to make you turn away. Heartburn is a symptom of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, commonly called acid reflux, and the pain is caused by stomach acid damaging the tissue in your esophagus. It&#39;s more than a minor annoyance—GERD is a precursor to esophageal cancer, and it affects over 50 million Americans. There are medications to treat GERD, but what most sufferers don&#39;t realize is that a few simple lifestyle changes can help your medication work better—or get you off medications completely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acid Reflux Diet &amp; Cookbook for Dummies&lt;/i&gt; is your roadmap to ending GERD for good. In it, you&#39;ll find lifestyle and diet modifications that prevent symptoms from occurring in the first place, as well as explanations about the mechanism of the condition and how and why these modifications help. The book contains over 70 practical recipes, plus tips on navigating grocery stores, restaurant menus, and the holiday season. You&#39;ll gain valuable insight on the small, easy changes that can make a big difference, and get answers to questions like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Is your posture and sleep position working against you?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Can chewing gum really help or hurt?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What supplements may work just as well, or better than, prescriptions?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How does eating more often help prevent symptoms?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;ve tried every treatment available and still haven&#39;t found relief, or are hoping to avoid prescription medication completely, &lt;i&gt;Acid Reflux Diet &amp; Cookbook for Dummies&lt;/i&gt; is a clear, comprehensive guide to getting rid of GERD.&lt;/p&gt;" />
