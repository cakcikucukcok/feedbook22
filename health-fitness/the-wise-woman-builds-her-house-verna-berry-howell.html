  <title>The Wise Woman Builds Her House - Verna Berry Howell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a day and age when couples live in meaningful relationships without a legal or religious contract of marriage and when the divorce rate among those who choose to marry hovers between 50 and 60 percent, a book on marriage may seem to be an anachronism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Mrs. Howell draws on her experience of two successful marriages that spanned more than fifty-eight years. She offers her sage and insightful advice to anyone contemplating going into matrimony, to those considering getting a divorce, or even more tragic, to those who continue to live in a union that is not fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage was instituted by God, not by mankind. Biblical principles teach us how to achieve productive, satisfying, and long lasting marriages. This book is an analogy of a physical house and a wedded relationship. Many couples put more time and thought into building their dream house than they do in building their marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader will examine the laying of the foundation through the framing of the structure. In architecture, each step is predicated on the successful implementation of that specific part of the build that came before it. It is imperative that careful attention is given to each part in order to attain the dream result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widowed again, with a twinkle in her eye, Mrs. Howell states, Im looking for number three so I can start a new house.&lt;/p&gt;" />
