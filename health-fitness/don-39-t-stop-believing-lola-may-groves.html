  <title>Don&#39;t Stop Believing - Lola May Groves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book &quot;Don&#39;t Give Up&quot; was written to help other young people who are sad and feel alone.  The main character is a girl who experiences these emotions and fought to make a better life for herself.
With the help of two best friends she makes it through high school.  Katie takes the bull by the horn and goes to community college and works at the same time  I wanted to show young adults that they have to make the change in their lives and only they can do it.  Believe in God and in yourself.
Katie finds a job that she is very good at after college and prospers.  She start to gain friends at the clinic where she works and starts to enjoy life more than she ever thought possible.  But she made it happen and didn&#39;t rely on others to make the changes.
Remember that happiness is always in sight as in Katie case she gets married and settles down to a very happy life with her long time boyfriend." />
