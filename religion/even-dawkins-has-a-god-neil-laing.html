  <title>Even Dawkins Has a God - Neil Laing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkinss &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion &lt;/em&gt;is one of the most serious attacks on religion in recent times. A number of highly capable authors have countered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neils reply is different from most. He finds areas of agreement with Dawkins over a number of his assessments of religion while exposing his erroneous understanding of the nature of God. He shows that Dawkinss attack on God is irrelevant even though he successfully demolishes what he imagines is the Christian god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Neil tries to equip Christians to come to an informed intelligent position, to lose their fears of science, and to see its wonderful strengths. He challenges the assumptions made particularly by the New Atheists in imagining that faith is a childish approach to origins and furthermore that their own views are similar to some religions so that they virtually have a god themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tackling thorny topics like the meaning of faith, miracles, morality, and righteousness, Neil honestly appraises Christian views, tries to debunk misconceptions about these topics, and shows that science and faith can be mutually enhancing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
