  <title>I’Ll Take God - Irene M. Tomkinson Msw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ill Take God-Hold the Religion is compelling, funny, raw and wise.  This Jewish girl loves what this Catholic girl wrote and the way she wrote it.  I came home to parts of my own story in a new way.  We all have a relationship with this experience called Life.  Irene challenges us to live our experience by choice  not by default. 
Nancy Slonim Aronie  Author, Founder Chilmark Writing Workshop, NPR Contributor.
For anyone grappling with separating religion and God, or religion and spirituality, Ill Take God-Hold the Religion is a must.  This amazing human being sharing her wisdom and experience from her own spiritual journey has helped me discover and learn to live from my still small voice. Yes, I have found my own deep sense of KNOWING.  At 72, I am finally learning to trust myself.
