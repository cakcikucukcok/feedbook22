  <title>Encountering Jesus: Praying the Commands of Christ into Your Life - Norval Hadley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you long for an encounter with Jesus? Then &quot;follow Me,&quot; He said.   Following Jesus means also that we are to &quot;obey all that I have commended you.&quot; But the commands of Jesus are not just another set of rules. They are principles for living that if followed, will take you into a powerful encounter with Jesus.   But without His help, following His commands is impossible to do. That&#39;s where prayer comes in. Learning to pray the commands will give you the enablement to obey the commands of Christ.   Encountering Jesus groups the commands into three categories: Upward (relating to God), Outward (relating to others), and Inward (relating to self). A devotional study of each command is presented, followed by suggestions on how to pray it into your life.   Useful for personal, group and family study, Encountering Jesus has 30 short chapters, making it an excellent month-long prayer initiative for a congregation to do together." />
