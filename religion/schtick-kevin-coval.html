  <title>Schtick - Kevin Coval</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;li&gt;For nearly 2 decades, Coval has held a rare position among Jewish literary writers, maintaining a humorous and loving take on Jewish culture that&#39;s also vocal in criticism of prevailing Jewish-American politics in support of Israel. Coval has garnered attention from Jewish outlets such as Heeb, which named Coval one of the &quot;Heeb 100&quot;; the Jewish Daily Forward which praised his &quot;redefining what makes a Jewish story&quot;; Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture which published many of his poems on Palestine; Jewcy; and Tikkun Magazine which supported Coval after being disinvited from 2 major Jewish conferences, for his stance on Israel. This is his first work to date dedicated entirely to the Jewish American experience.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;li&gt;Readers will encounter many familiar figures: Lenny Bruce, Sid Caesar, Allen Ginsberg, Joan Rivers, Barbara Streisand, Sammy Davis Jr, Roseanne Barr &amp; others make appearances in Schtick, alongside poems that underline the meaning behind moments in Jewish-American pop culture, such as Sammy Davis Jr.&#39;s conversion; Don Rickles roasting of Ronald Reagan; Jennifer Grey&#39;s nose job; the supposed anti-Semitism that ended Rev. Jesse Jackson&#39;s Presidential campaign.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;li&gt;Israel&#39;s 2010 assault on Gaza produced a new wave of &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; Jewish-American activism, as documented in The Nation: http://www.thenation.com/article/american-jews-rethink-israel&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
