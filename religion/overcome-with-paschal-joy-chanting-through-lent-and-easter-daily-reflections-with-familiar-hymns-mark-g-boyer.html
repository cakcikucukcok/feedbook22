  <title>Overcome with Paschal Joy: Chanting through Lent and Easter-Daily Reflections with Familiar Hymns - Mark G. Boyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lent-Easter seasons cover one-fourth of the year, or 25 percent of the liturgical year. One of the many things we do as Roman Catholics is sing Lenten and Easter hymns. During Lent, we express our sorrow for sin as we pray, fast, and give alms. During Easter, we shout Alleluias at the end of many hymns to express our praise of God for having raised Christ from the dead. Thus, those who observe Lent and Easter sing religious hymns written for each season. The sounds of Lenten hymns in minor keys give way to Easter hymns in major ones.  This book presents an exercise for every day of Lent and Easter that combines the daily Scripture texts from the Lectionary for Mass with religious hymns sung during Lent and Easter. It is designed to be used by individuals for private prayer or by families for public prayer. A six-part exercise is offered for every one of the 135 entries: (1) the liturgical day, (2) the daily Scripture texts, (3) a verse from a traditional hymn, (4) a reflection, (5) a question for personal meditation, and (6) a concluding prayer." />
