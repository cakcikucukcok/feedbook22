  <title>Speak to Me - Edwin A. James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All of my material comes from the King James Version of the Bible, from the Oxford Bible, and from personal spiritual experiences. Open your eyes and you will see, open your ears and you will hear. He Is in Everything And Everywhere. My books are designed for the true seekers of God, the ones who want more and cant get enough of his glory and love. For our blood, sweat, and tears are crucified with him (Edwin James).
My love of God has influenced me to write this book. This love has also driven me to study the scriptures and many sources of biblical information for a greater understanding of the Bible and God. For without understanding, you are lost, and words have no true meaning. But with understanding, not only do words take on meaning, but they surpass the eyes and mind. They are planted in the heart and soul.
I present nothing new that will cause great contemplation. No, I present a collection of accepted Christian doctrine and information gathered in one place to ease scriptural study and improve the biblical studiers rate of understanding.
The information given in this text has been gathered from many sources. By having this reference guide, you will no longer have to search though many other avenues of information.
This text is meant to be a small, lightweight quick reference for biblical history, names, colors, numbers, symbols, and herbs. I do not submit. The text contains the only meaning or uses for the previously mentioned subject matter. However, the text will bring a greater understanding to the scriptures.
I have added thirty-one sermons for Bible study. All of the sermons are based on the King James Bible." />
