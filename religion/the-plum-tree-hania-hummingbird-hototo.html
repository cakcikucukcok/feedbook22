  <title>The Plum Tree - Hania Hummingbird Hototo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Plum Tree is a Christmas story believe it or not. I was not intending at the time to write such a tale as the Plum Tree. In fact I hadn&#39;t been thinking of writing at all. It just happened that I awoke one morning during the Christmas season with this story, complete with characters and title, in my head and the wonderful feeling of its meaning and significance in my heart. I got up straight from bed and wrote it down. At the beginning the tale asks &#39;What is it that makes a person good?&#39; The answer to that is a Mystery that defies words, but the effect of a good person on the life of another can be chronicled, and that is what the Plum Tree is, a short chronicle and poignant reminder that how we live our lives, despite circumstances, and how we relate to one another can have a profound and beneficial effect. I have my short-comings and am not always a good person, yet I believe it was not an accident I was unexpectedly gifted this tale of goodness to share with others, for I believe its message does not stray from the true meaning of the gift giving season in which we celebrate the Light that was gifted to the world through Christ.&quot;" />
