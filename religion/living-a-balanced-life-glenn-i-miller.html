  <title>Living a Balanced Life - Glenn I. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why do some people facing difficulties in their lives not only survive but thrive through such experiences, while others facing similar situations fall apart, lose their way, and have little direction or purpose in their lives? Author Glenn I. Miller holds that the difference rests on realities concerning relationshipsspecifically with ones having to do with living a balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, he shows how people who listen to the teachings and follow the leadership of Jesus find ways to discover durable balance despite the adversity they face. By providing a guided exploration of the ministry of Jesus, Miller demonstrates that balance, fullness, and purpose come when you practice the threefold ways of love of God, others, and self. Devoting one section to each of these forms of love, Living a Balanced Life outlines how you can learn to live in balance by avoiding the excesses illustrated in contemporary culture, listening to the teachings of the Lord, and gaining insights from Millers experiences in military and civilian ministry. The final section draws together the insights from the first three sections and suggests ways to live with balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have taken stock of your life and relationships and hope to find a pathway to living with greater balance, Living a Balanced Life can offer you an informative and enjoyable resource filled with biblical wisdom, helpful truths, intriguing illustrations, dashes of humor, and commonsense wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
