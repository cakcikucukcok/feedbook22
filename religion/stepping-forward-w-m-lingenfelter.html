  <title>Stepping Forward - W. M. Lingenfelter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ephesians    much read, much preached upon, little understood, and even less practiced. Sadly, this New Testament letter is so familiar that we often all but ignore it. And thats what author Mike Lingenfelter wants to change. Clearly, he understands that if we pause, take in and then practice what this letter prescribes, it will change the life and impact of church and believer alike. To make us pay attention, he has pleasingly carved our biblical meal into thirty-nine portions, each of which uncovers a life-giving, result-getting truth that corrects, directs, and empowers Christ-followers. So take another look at this familiar letter. You may find that the truths you encounter in this study arent as familiar as you thought  that their impact will change your heart and your walk. I highly recommend this thoughtful work to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bert Downs, Chancellor, Western Seminary, and Executive Director, Southwest Church Connection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Stepping Forward &lt;/i&gt;provides bite-size portions into understanding the book of Ephesians. It is informative, instructional, and often challenging. The emphasis on the practical application of God&#39;s Word into our everyday lives is the key to Christian maturity. &lt;/p&gt;
