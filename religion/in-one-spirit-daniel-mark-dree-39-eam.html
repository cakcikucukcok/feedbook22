  <title>IN ONE SPIRIT - Daniel Mark, Dree&#39;eam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hopefully from the start, you will see that this book is about us&amp;hellip; each and every one of us! &lt;em&gt;In One Spirit &lt;/em&gt;is an interfaith manual with a compilation of mystical truths, history lessons, personal adventures, spiritual journeys, multicultural experiences, interfaith lessons and a practical, refreshing worldview. Open-hearted, open-minded worldviews help us to appreciate diversity and encourage &amp;lsquo;live and let live&amp;rsquo; attitudes. As we learn to value others, our traditions and ideals come together to create richness and more joyful lives, Wholistic,&amp;nbsp;cohesive worldviews also help us explain&amp;nbsp;how we are ONE in spirit. If we hurt others, we hurt ourselves as well. When we care for others, we care for ourselves as well. This book emphasizes the importance of positive thinking and how forgiveness, acceptance and empathy can jump-start a sustainable movement that supports responsible peace and security along with environmental healing. International and interfaith relationships can be improved if we appreciate our common ground, work cooperatively together and practice compassionate communication skills. This world faces many, big challenges. By taking a closer look at our potential as well as how history has impacted us,&amp;nbsp;we can recognize and apply a number of practical principles involving balance, health and harmony to the way we choose to live our individual lives. In so doing, we can cultivate and promote peace and wellness in our homes, in our communities and around our planet. Even though this book draws upon decades of my personal, spiritual and mystical explorations, it could be about anyone with similar travels and travails. I invite you to journey along with me, so you too can experience some of these amazing adventures. I hope you will be able to experience some of the &amp;lsquo;highs&amp;rsquo; of the journey vicariously and&amp;nbsp;learn from my experiences so that you can avoid potential pitfalls. I believe that when we stop learning, we start dying; therefore, I regularly take an honest inventory of my life, evaluating ways to strengthen my body, my heart and my mind. Each of us can benefit from&amp;nbsp;lifelong learning! As a result of my adventures into the realms of health, science, mysticism, nature and sexuality, I share personal, experiential knowledge and expertise along with educated opinions, spiritual intuitions and a number of creative concepts that may help you or someone you love.&amp;nbsp;I have lived overseas approximately 20 years in a wide variety of places where I learned firsthand about multicultural diversity and interfaith cooperation. I was the founder and director of a non-profit organization in the Middle East. dedicated to fostering wholistic health and wholistic peace. It was called &amp;ldquo;Har Eitan Makom Shalom&amp;rdquo; which means the Mt. of Strength Place of Peace. As part of my work, I consulted with officials from the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority, the US government, the European Union and a wide range of other organizations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
