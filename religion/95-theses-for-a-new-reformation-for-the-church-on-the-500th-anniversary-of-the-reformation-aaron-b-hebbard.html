  <title>95 Theses for a New Reformation: For the Church on the 500th Anniversary of the Reformation - Aaron B. Hebbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Five hundred years ago Martin Luther wrote his Ninety-Five Theses, inaugurating the Protestant Reformation, and with it exemplified an unflinching devotion to return to the Word of God as the ultimate authority. Today, the church is also in desperate need for reformation--a new reformation to correct her shortcomings and meet the challenges of the day. Some might see everything as fine, some might see everything as hopeless, and others might simply dismiss the church as irrelevant, too impotent to reform herself, much less to strengthen the disintegrating family or address the downward-spiraling culture with a prophetic voice.   95 Theses for a New Reformation confronts the necessity for reformation today head-on. Over thirty of today&#39;s pastors, theologians, and church leaders analyze ninety-five current problems, search the Scriptures for solutions, and make sound biblical appropriations to implement into the life of the church, family, and culture. On this 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation, let us pray that the Lord will again revive his church for his own glory and for the purification of Christ&#39;s beloved bride, the church. And let us prepare ourselves to respond with urgency to God&#39;s call to action by reforming the church, family, and culture." />
