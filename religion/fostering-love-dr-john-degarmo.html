  <title>Fostering Love - Dr. John DeGarmo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Children suffering from abuse. Neglect. Malnutrition. Even drug-related problems passed on from a mothers addiction. Children rejected by those who were to love them most, their parents. When placed into a foster home, many of these children carry with them the physical and emotional scars that prevent them from accepting the love of another. This journey as a foster parent is the most difficult thing John DeGarmo has done. Through the sleepless nights with drug-addicted babies, the battles with angry teens, and the tears from such tremendous sadness, John DeGarmo learns that to follow Gods call in his life means to take up His cross in his own home. Fostering Love: One Foster Parents Journey is the true-life account of his experience as a foster parent, along with his wife and their own three children, as he followed Gods call to take foster children into his home.  This is a story of heartbreak, sadness, and ultimately love as he came to find God in the tears and smiles of many foster children." />
