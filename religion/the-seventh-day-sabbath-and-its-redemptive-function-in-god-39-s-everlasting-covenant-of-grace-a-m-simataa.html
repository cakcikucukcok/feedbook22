  <title>The Seventh-Day Sabbath and Its Redemptive Function in God&#39;s Everlasting Covenant of Grace - A. M. Simataa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This special and remarkablebook,
The Seventh-day Sabbath and
its Redemptive Function in Gods
Everlasting Covenant of Grace by A.M.
Simataa addresses topical issues in
the Bible quite pertinent to the 21st
Century Christianity.&lt;b&gt;
The author takes a defensive approach
of the gospel and brings to the surface
some of the least understood teachings
of the Bible. Although written from a
Seventh-day Adventists perspective,
people of differing religious background
and persuasions will fi nd this book
very instructive.&lt;b&gt;
If you have been looking for a book that
pains takingly discusses the Gospel
seriously and biblically this is the book
you have been searching for. Some of
the topics featured in the book include:&lt;b&gt;
 The Truth about the Bible Sabbath&lt;b&gt;
 The Judgment of the Living&lt;b&gt;
 Heavenly New Jerusalem;&lt;b&gt;
 The Marriage Supper of the Lamband the Rapture&lt;b&gt;
 The Remnant Church in the Parables&lt;b&gt;
Mr A.M. Simataa teaches at a High
School in Windhoek, Namibia. He
likes sharing the Gospel with others
and spends some of his spare time
witnessing to others.&lt;b&gt;
The central role of the Seventh-day
Sabbath in the Redemption of our
race is the least understood topic
in the Bible today. Most believers
have even dismissed its relevance to
todays Christianity.&lt;b&gt;
However, the truth is that the Sabbath
is at the heart of Christs work to save
human beings in accordance with
Gods plan. The Sabbath is so central
to the work of atonement that Christ is
referred to in the Bible as the Lord of
the Sabbath.&lt;b&gt;
The issue of the Sabbath will become
pertinent as we near the End, and
every human being will be required to
take a stand in the confl ict involving
the Sabbath question. This book will
plant your feet on a solid foundation.&lt;b&gt;" />
