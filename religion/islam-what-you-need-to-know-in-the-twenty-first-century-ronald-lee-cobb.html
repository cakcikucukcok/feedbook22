  <title>Islam, What You Need to Know in the Twenty-First Century - Ronald Lee Cobb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At its core, Islam is a religion of peace. Its very name implies Salaam, Shalom, and Peace. In its first 100 years Islam controlled Spain, all of North Africa, Arabia, and much of the Middle East. Most of its development was peaceful and centered on a &quot;Most Merciful Creator of All Things&quot; emphasis. Europe would have become Islamic if Charles Martel of France in the West and the City of Vienna in the East, had not halted the spread of Islam. Extremists in the Twenty-First Century have too often wrapped themselves in the flag of Islam while they have repeatedly violated many of the teachings of the Qur&#39;an and of the Hadith. You will find that the stories in this book rarely appear in the headlines of Western news media. These stories and their knowledge will help you find peace. Armed with these facts and this inner peace and knowledge, may you help bring more peace to our planet. The vast majority of the followers of Islam want to live in peace and prosperity. Prosperity can only come through understanding and through peace. May the peace of the Loving Creator be with you always on your spiritual journey through life." />
