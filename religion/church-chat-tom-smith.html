  <title>Church Chat - Tom Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On March 13, 2013, the Catholic Church changed dramatically when Pope Francis I, the Argentine slum walker, immediately began to redefine the papacy. His refreshing yet humble leadership collides with the approach of previous popes and revives the themes of the Second Vatican Council. In &lt;i&gt;Church Chat&lt;/i&gt;, author Tom Smith catalogues that remarkable transition in an entertaining and thought provoking style.  
A collection of previously published columns dating from 2009 and into 2014, &lt;i&gt;Church Chat&lt;/i&gt; fearlessly displays some flaws of the Catholic Church while applauding the leadership of Pope Francis. It is written by a progressive, and still practicing, Catholic who insists Its my Church, too!&lt;p&gt;
Transition times stir things up, cause unusual hopes and fears, bring stuff at the bottom to the top and take one set of priorities and replace them with another. Things move quickly during major transitions, what was standard at one time is replaced by a new approach.&lt;p&gt;
Since this new period is just beginning, we dont know how it will turn out, but one thing is certain: these are historic times in the Catholic Church. Pope Francis is moving quickly on many fronts and the vision of Vatican II is growing some flesh. Finally.&lt;p&gt;
Every Catholic -- liberal, conservative, or confused -- will benefit from Tom Smiths intelligent book Church Chat. I highly recommend this lively and loving book.&lt;br&gt;
Michael Leach, author of &lt;i&gt;Why Stay Catholic?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Unexpected Answers to a Life-Changing Question&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Church Chat is a great read for veteran Church reformers as well as for people in the pews. The issue treatment is very comprehensive and right on... all done in a friendly conversational style. The reader thus comes away with a window into a hope filled near future for the People of God as well as a warm connection with Tom on his soulful journey forward.&lt;br&gt;
