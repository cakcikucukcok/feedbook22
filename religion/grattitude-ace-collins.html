  <title>GrATTITUDE - Ace Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To most making it through tough times is never financially easy. Those who got through the periods of “Great Depression” did so with grit, determination, a can-do spirit and a lot of courage. Best of all, they came out stronger too! Those who survive those challenges and come out with a solid self-concept, a loving family and grounded faith ridded themselves of spiritual and mental baggage that would have otherwise destroyed them.  They had a lean mind to go with a toned body. As we gaze at the hard days in front of us, it is time to look back on some time-tested examples of those who thrived in tough times as well as those whose mental baggage caused them to crash and burn.  The lessons in this book involve not as much what each of us can add to insure survival, but what we can shed from our minds to keep out spirits high and our attitudes on an even keel.  In trying times or even when things are great a fit, lean, positive mind is the key to being happy." />
