  <title>Release Restore Rejoice - Renée Jéan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why you lived through a difficult, life threatening, and heart-wrenching situation? Why did you survive the vehicle accident, shooting, fatal disease, financial devastation, abuse, neglect, overdose, domestic violence, or suicide attempt? Do you think your survival is in vain? Your suffering, survival, and strength are not in vain! God has chosen you for a unique purpose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your circumstance does not determine your identity; your God does. You are not what happened to you or what you did in your past. You can change and you can overcome. What once harmed you has now armed you. Let those circumstances which once harmed you now equip you with the essentials for your intended God-given purpose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our faith is challenged and perfected in our trials. Our mission is manifested as we mend. Do you know the God of a second chance? I do! The intent of your trials is not to pull you away, but to build a platform for Him to work through you to touch and change others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understand you can allow your circumstances to do one of two things: destroy you or make you stronger. The Lord is asking you not to fear, but to have faith and trust in Him. God is calling you to rise up and turn your despair into destiny. Now is your time to Release, Restore and Rejoice!&lt;/p&gt;" />
