  <title>He - Ed Rhymer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is only one God. He is called by many names, and that is understandable in view of the many and varied cultures of the world. Failure to recognize and respect and tolerate other cultures is the primary cause of conflicts.
Faith is ones belief and, yes, understanding of each individual. For that very reason, individual intelligence varies. And therefore, everyone cannot be expected to comprehend in the same manner.
Each of us lives and learns in many different ways and through innumerable experiences.
It is not always an individuals good fortune to develop a polished and likeable personality. Getting along with others is always a challenge. Refinement can be either genuine or a false front. Oftentimes, it seems more of the latter.
Politicians often deliberately encourage dissension among the citizens for their self-serving reasons. Many times, over the differences in individual faiths. Unfortunately, it seems we are presently top-heavy with far too many, who seem to practice this philosophy with every breath they take.
Why do so many wait so late in life to become serious regarding the welfare of their soul?
Many of us are introduced to a very special gentleman during our youth. If so, our entire lives will have the opportunity to be enriched by the guidance and protection that only he can provide.
Occasionally, we are reminded of the experience at unexpected times, often in most unusual ways and places. However, his reminders and nudges are always gentle and timely. Although, there are occasions when a more attention-getting method is required. Regardless of the manner, we should be forever grateful that he cares." />
