  <title>Men Possessing the Total Package - Dr. Jerlette Mickie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Words From The Author
  It is my heart&#39;s desire to see men performing their role as a role model for future young men to emulate. In this shaky economy that we live in, we need men of quality.
 Throughout this book, I am targeting men that need to step up and give their all in everything God has designed them to be.  Having raised three sons, I feel compelled to write about the growing epidemic that is facing the men of the population. 
If men are not pursuing, there will always be a page in their life that will render incompleteness until he summons God for direction. I am inclined to believe that the family is out of sync without him and a better unit with him.  
Whether you are men in the corporate world, Christian arena, work place, or even incarcerated, this book is prepared just for you and will provide the right tools you need, to possess the Total Package. This book displays the qualities and characteristics that each man should attain to fulfill their assignment and purpose in life.
