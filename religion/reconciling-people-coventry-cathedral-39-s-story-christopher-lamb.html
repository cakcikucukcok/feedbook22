  <title>Reconciling People: Coventry Cathedral&#39;s Story - Christopher Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To mark the 50th anniversary in 2012 of the rebuilding of Coventry Cathedral after its destruction by incendiary bombs in November 1940, this lavishly illustrated volume celebrates a unique church with a unique mission. The decision to rebuild the Cathedral was taken the morning after the bombing - not as an act of defiance, but one of faith, trust and hope for the future of the world. Reconciling People tells the story of every aspect the Cathedral&#39;s life: its architecture in war and in peace, its theology, worship and spirituality, music and the arts, its mission and ministry, its place in the life of the city, the Cathedral as a place of reconciliation, its people over the decades and its life today. Co-published with the Friends of Coventry Cathedral, this celebratory volume is a record of a how a 900-year old cathedral rose from the ashes of violent destruction to become a symbol of reconciliation and to develop a unique mission among Britain&#39;s churches." />
