  <title>Fire In My Bones: A Walk Through Jeremiah - Douglas Humphries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;But if I say, &#39;I will not mention him or speak anymore in his name,&#39; his word is in my heart like a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in. Indeed, I cannot.&quot;  - J. 20:9  Heinrich Ewald called Jeremiah, &quot;the most human prophet.&quot; To Douglas Humphries, he&#39;s always been Jerry, &quot;the prophet who talked back.&quot; Unexpectedly, blessedly standing in opposition to everything he thought it took to be one of the faithful. Jeremiah&#39;s story is one of rejection and destruction, tragic and yet profoundly hopeful. A true picture of what it costs to do the hard, right thing. What it means to follow God. What it means to even know God. And it found Douglas exactly when he needed it to. Part biblical analysis, part memoir, part confessional. As much a reaction to scripture as it is an investigation of it. This book brings new insight into an old, but all too familiar story. A new way to consider an old, but dear prophet." />
