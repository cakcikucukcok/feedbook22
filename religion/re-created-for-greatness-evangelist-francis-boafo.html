  <title>Re-Created for Greatness - Evangelist Francis Boafo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many people seek Gods Heaven and His promised glory but are ignorant of the demand it places on them after their redemption. The attainment of the promised glory requires submission to Gods dominion, power, and authority in Christ Jesus now. Your submission prepares and makes you ready for your eternal destiny in heaven, where the all-consuming presence of God dwells. The Bible says that without holiness, no one will see God. The infinite Lord constrained Himself within our finite body to give you the opportunity to share His infinite nature and glory in heaven. What is your response? Are you correctly oriented toward this divine destiny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be like people whose lifestyles, relationship with people, and with the things of this evil age show that they are oblivious to the demand of their eternal destiny. Many people have their hearts inordinately oriented toward their now needs, with little regard for their eternal destiny. If you truly are seeking your promised glory in heaven, journey through the pages of this book to discover some of the things you need to know and practice to ensure your promised glory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
