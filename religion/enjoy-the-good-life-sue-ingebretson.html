  <title>Enjoy the Good Life - Sue Ingebretson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you a Christian but living an average life?  Maybe youre not a Christian and know someone who is and think, I dont want to be like them.  Theyre too religious.  Many people, whether Christian or not, are destroyed for a lack of knowledge.  Many have not been taught the full Gospel.  Most believe they are forgiven of their sins but havent read the Bible for themselves.
Jesus Christ brought Heaven to earth.  As a Christian, you dont live in the real world, you live in the Kingdom of God and can overcome every obstacle there is in life.  What Jesus Christ did for all has been downplayed.  The Truth about the Bible has either been mixed up, taught incorrectly, or watered down.  Find out what the Truth really is.  Learn what Jesus death and resurrection really mean.  Discover how you dont have to be sick, broke, or depressed.  Learn what you inherit when you believe in Jesus Christ and start to live the good life that God intended for His kids to live.  You can live Heaven on earth today.  You dont have to wait until you die.  Get the knowledge you need to live an over and above life.  And lets see a major change in our homes, cities, country, and world.  Are you with me?" />
