  <title>Stay Alert and Take Notes - Jesse Crimm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Teaching Christian values and concepts to small groups is a weighty and worthy challenge. The purpose of this book is to make your yoke easily bearable. As Barnabus was to Paul, this book can be your encourager, your intercessor, and your foundation for inspired teaching and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within you will find specific guidance on conducting Christian development classes and thirty-three lessons proven in real life to be ones where the students do indeed stay alert and take notes. Also included are lists of subject-appropriate hymns for classes that sing. A catalog of additional source readings is offered for your continuing enrichment and growth as a teacher or student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your presentation of a lesson begins with your willingness to prepare, and that simple willingness is our beginning point. No more is needed (Acts 16:10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any number of possible reasons, someone asked you to teach Sunday school this week (Acts15:3). That someone trusted you enough to propose the question. Truly, if you think about it, your reputation preceded the asking of that question. And for any number of possible reasons, you said yes. Most likely you were predisposed to say yes. Maybe you said yes just to help out because no one else would say yes. Maybe you have wanted to teach but were always too modest to broach the thought publically. If any of these reasons are true, you have a great adventure in front of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy, learn, teach, and catch the flame.&lt;/p&gt;" />
