  <title>The Cord: A Novel - Stephen W. Robbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pastor Payne Donovan was weary to the bone. He often wondered if he made any difference in people&#39;s lives or if his church had any impact on the world around him. In the midst of Payne&#39;s despair, George Carlson, head of a genetic laboratory called SarkiSystems, offers hope to revive and embolden Payne&#39;s ministry by a merging of faith and technology. Dazzled by George&#39;s charisma, Payne agrees to go to a meeting and soon finds himself deeply entangled in a plan to revive the faith of the world. But the more Payne invests in the plan, the more broken his family becomes. Pastor Donovan must let go of the hope that SarkiSystems offers in order to find healing for his family and true hope for the world." />
