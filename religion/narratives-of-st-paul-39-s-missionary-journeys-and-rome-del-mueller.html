  <title>Narratives of St. Paul&#39;s Missionary Journeys and Rome - Del Mueller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered what it would be like to accompany St. Paul as he declared the Good News of salvation to thousands who lived in the Mediterranean region? Imagine your satisfaction when the council in Jerusalem mandates limited obligation to the Mosaic Law; and your frustration when the message of this freedom results in defamation and threats of death. Rejoice with Paul as the Roman Consul Gallio declares he is free to teach Jesus as Messiah. Follow Paul into the Antonia Fortress when assaulted by enraged Jews. Listen to his defense before Felix and Festus. Endure a life threatening shipwreck and imprisonment in Rome. Finally, stand by him as he approaches his last days as prisoner under Nero and his death; a victorious transition from a sainted physical life to a blessed and eternal spiritual life. 
Del Mueller takes readers into the thoughts and hearts of the key witnesses to Pauls missionary journeys. He writes a first person account that provides readers with a unique historical perspective on the stories as they really could have happened. Narratives of St. Pauls Missionary Journeys and Rome will personalize the post-resurrection events that altered the world and show readers the humanness of those who were changed because of Pauls message." />
