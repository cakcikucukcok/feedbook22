  <title>How to Read the Bible Without Losing Your Mind: A Truth-Seeker&#39;s Guide to Making Sense of Scripture - Kent Blevins, Glen Stassen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does reading the Bible sometimes leave you confused? Do you have difficulty seeing the relevance of the Bible to modern concerns or to important issues in your life? Do you believe Bible reading and intellectual inquiry are mutually exclusive? This book explores how the Bible can serve as a resource for discovering truth. It provides a method that accepts and incorporates the knowledge gained from modern scholarship while also recognizing that truth-discovery is a personal, multifaceted journey. It honors the integrity of Scripture while remaining open to insight from additional truth-sources. In exploring what we mean when we speak of the Bible&#39;s authority, it is honest about the challenges presented to modern readers by the cultural chasm separating the biblical writers from today&#39;s world. How to Read the Bible Without Losing Your Mind shows how the Bible can be read with full engagement of both mind and heart." />
