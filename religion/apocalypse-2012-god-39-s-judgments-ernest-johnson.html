  <title>Apocalypse 2012: God&#39;s Judgments - Ernest Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Ernest Johnson delves into the passages of the scriptures, in particular the Book of Revelation to glean insights on the storm that is to come. By studying the prophecies of old, he predicts the war of tomorrow, and foresees the forces that will bring ruination through out the world in Apocalypse 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say,, &#39;come and see&#39;! I looked and there before me was a pale horse! it&#39;s rider was named death, and Hades was following close behind him,&quot; This is but one ominous passage in the book of Revelations foretelling the doom that will come to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Numerous other prophecies predict the coming of the end times, and continue to spread fear and uncertainty, especially when the occurrence of terrible wars and calamities seem to concur with their divination. In the light of this, with Apocalypse 2012: God&#39;s Judgments, Johnson uses his understanding of the Word of the Lord to outline the true meaning of these foreboding signs and portents, their place in God&#39;s plan, and their implications on the lives of the faithful and the non-faithful alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His book explains how current and future events will herald the rise of the Anti-Christ and the Second coming of Christ. According to the Bible, these are the signs leading to the rapture, and preceding the plagues that will scourge the remnants of mankind after the true believers have been spirited away into the heavens, safe from the horror about to befall those left behind. It is in this time that the angels will sound the Trumpets announcing the arrival of the apocalypse and the ultimate Judgment of God will bestowedupon humanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apocalypse 2012: God&#39;s Judgments studies the sacred Word of the Holy Bible to interpret present happenings and glean insights into the days to come. For believers of the faith, and those who wish to know what will come after the end of the year 2012, Johnson&#39;s work will make for a truly engrossing reading experience. &lt;/p&gt;
