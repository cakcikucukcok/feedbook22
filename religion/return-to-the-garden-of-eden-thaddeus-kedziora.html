  <title>Return to the Garden of Eden - Thaddeus Kedziora</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Return to the Garden of Eden is dedicated to refuting the unbiblical error of Replacement Theology, which supposes that God has spiritually replaced Israel with the Church.  The problem with this understanding is, if God replaced Israel, who was promised an everlasting possession of land, then what good is His promise of an everlasting salvation to the Church.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book concentrates on the multitude of verses in scripture, which indicate that the national restoration of Israel is an absolute imperative.  It demonstrates that Israels existence today was not only predicted, but necessary for Christ to return to earth, just as He said He would.  This book illuminates the fact that Israel being a nation in our time, is a miracle to be witnessed by we Christians, and a comfort and encouragement that God always keeps his word literally, not allegorically.&lt;/p&gt;" />
