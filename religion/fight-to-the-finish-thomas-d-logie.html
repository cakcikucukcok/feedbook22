  <title>Fight to the Finish - Thomas D. Logie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why the title Fight to the Finish?  It would be more pleasant and more popular to write of love and peace than of spiritual warfare. Indeed, inner love and peace is a part of the Christian life, and eventually, we will enjoy everlasting love and peace. But there is war ahead before there will be peace.  In September 1938, Prime Minister Chamberlain of England claimed that he had negotiated with Hitler Peace in our time. Winston Churchill warned of war around the corner. Who was right?
	The majority of Israel in Isaiahs day had a similar aversion to unpleasant truths. He was told, Do not prophesy to us right things; speak to us smooth things (Isaiah 30:10). But I cant do that and be faithful to God at the same time. I have a responsibility to God and to my readers to tell biblical truth with as little distortion as possible, although I know that there will be some distortion because I still have a sinful nature and a limited mind. Going back to my first book, I bear the responsibility of a watchman portrayed in Ezekiel 3 and 33in contemporary language, a sentryto sound a warning. The direct preliminary steps to the final battles may have already begunwe can only pinpoint exactly how each piece of the puzzle fits into Gods perfect plan in hindsight. But the final war between Jesus Christ and Satan is coming, and it is reasonable to believe that many who now breathe on this earth will participate in that final fight on one side or the other. This time the consequences cannot be reversed. So I plead with all believers to strap on your spiritual armor of Ephesians 6:1018 and train while there is still some measure of peace. I pray that this book will help you study the scriptures on your own and become practiced in studying the Sword of the Spirit. Dont take my word for everything that I saysearch the scriptures and see for yourselves!" />
