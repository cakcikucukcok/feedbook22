  <title>Twenty-One Candles: Stories for Christmas - Mike Mason, Ron Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twenty-one Candles - Stories for Christmas by Mike Mason  For over two decades, award-winning author Mike Mason has been circulating Christmas stories to a select circle of his closest friends.  Now he&#39;s sharing these classic Christmas stories with us.  Praise for Mike Mason&#39;s Twenty-one Candles  &quot;It has been my delight to listen as Mike Mason read aloud many of these stories-a score and one more of narratives that circle like candlelight around a season when light is scarce. Now, reading them, they bring a unique brightness, because in one way or another they illuminate more than just snow scenes and families around hearth fires. With a light and often whimsical touch, Mason&#39;s tales speak of the way &#39;people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light&#39; (Mt 12:16).&quot; Luci Shaw author of Breath for the Bones: Art, Imagination and Spirit  &quot;The best moments of Christmas are spent in the evening by the fire, telling stories... stories of courage and conviction, of discovering anew &#39;peace on earth; goodwill toward men.&#39; My friend, Mike Mason, has penned a collection of heartwarming stories to be told time and again, every Advent. May Twenty-one Candles become a Christmas classic for years to come!&quot; Joni Eareckson Tada Joni and Friends International Disability Center  &quot;In the tradition of our favorite Christmas tales, passed down from such masters as Charles Dickens and O. Henry, Mike Mason has lit Twenty-one Candles to shine fresh light into our darkness. Some shine with a mythopoeic ambiance, while others glow like mirrors from day to day life. They celebrate Christmas in ways you&#39;ll want to share. Gather around the Christmas tree; put another log on the fire. Mike Mason&#39;s stories want to be read aloud-read to families, to friends, to church groups-and you&#39;ll delight in sharing them.&quot; D.S. Martin author of Conspiracy of Light: Poems Inspired by the Legacy of C.S. Lewis  &quot;If you haven&#39;t read Mike Mason you live an impoverished life. Here is a book of frosty magic, wings of light, and the enchanting music of wisdom. With characteristically honest and beautiful prose, Mason has given us a gift that will warm hearts and kindle contemplation. These are stories that both refresh and rebuke. Read them and be awakened to joy.&quot; Andrew Case author of Water of the Word  &quot;These short stories are filled with charming, relatable characters discovering the spiritual origin and inspiration behind Christmas: Jesus Christ. Twenty-one Candles skillfully draws readers into its stories, inviting us to look beyond the veneer of a commercialized holiday season. Scratching the surface of our Christmas tradition, Mason captures glimpses of a loving God yearning to restore relationship with His children.&quot; Leonard Buhler President of Power to Change  &quot;In Twenty-one Candles master storyteller Mike Mason has carved out another classic. Truly a book for everyone that will captivate and inspire with its humor and unique way of spreading the true spirit of Christmas.&quot; Wally Armstrong author of The Mulligan  &quot;Twenty-one Candles should be as mandatory as mistletoe and manger scenes. Mike Mason&#39;s collection of funny, poignant, and inspired stories is a rare gift.&quot; Carolyn Arends Recording artist and author of Living the Questions  &quot;Twenty-one Candles captures the spirit of Christmas in a way all the commercial glitter never will. Mike shows the love and delight of the Messiah resonating in the hearts of those who need love and joy, and find them.&quot; David Gregory author of Dinner With a Perfect Stranger  Learn more about best-selling author Mike Mason at www.mikemasonbooks.com" />
