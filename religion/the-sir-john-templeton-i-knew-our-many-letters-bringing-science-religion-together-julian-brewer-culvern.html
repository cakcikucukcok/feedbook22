  <title>The Sir John Templeton I Knew: Our Many Letters Bringing Science &amp; Religion Together - Julian Brewer Culvern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sir John Templeton (1912-2008) was a noted philanthropist and a pioneer in finance, and this humble man was keenly interested in the intersection of science and religion. He established the Templeton Foundation, which dedicated much of Sir John&#39;s wealth to the mission of bringing together the fields of science and religion. In The Sir John Templeton I Knew, author Julian Brewer Culvern shares his collection of personal correspondence with this special man-letters collected while Culvern was privileged with working with Sir John in the 1970s.. The correspondence details their evolving kinship as Sir John and Culvern cultivate their zeal for seeking scientific evidence of God&#39;s actions in the world. A Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, Sir John was well prepared to embark on his quest to learn more about God&#39;s presence in the world today. See in his own words how this journey to unite science and religion occupied a paramount place in his life and in the lives of those he recruited to accomplish that task." />
