  <title>A River of Dreams - Darryl Barnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I was born in a beautiful rural area of South Australia. My younger years were spent playing sport and visiting nearby beaches to surf and swim. Living in this idealistic countryside gave me much inspiration to write my poetry. After moving to Adelaide in the early nineties, my writing slowed. When I began practicing tai chi and attending meditation classes, things for me changed again. Through these mindful practices, my passion to write was once again ignited. Over the last sixty years, I have seen and experienced a lot of life. Sometimes, almost magical, and other times, life gave me lessons of reality to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collection of poetry reflects the highs and lows of my life, with the eternal spark of optimism shining through its words. I trust you, the reader, will enjoy this work as much as I have bringing it to life. It has given me so much joy to finally get it published. I sincerely trust this book will encourage other writers to bring their stories to life. For our life is one big story, with belief we will manifest and create all our dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow your hearts and all things become possibleDarryl Barnett&lt;/p&gt;" />
