  <title>Programmed by God or Free to Choose?: Five-Point Calvinism Under the Searchlight - Dudley Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are we in fact more than just inert clay in the divine Potter&#39;s hands? This book seeks to prove conclusively from Scripture that mankind&#39;s freedom to seek God was not retracted at the fall, and that all humanity&#39;s sins were borne on the cross by the Lord Jesus Christ. The five points of Calvinism under scrutiny, often known by their acronym, TULIP, are a resume of doctrines formulated at the Council of Dort in 1619. This council maintained that the fall of Adam resulted in the inability of man to seek, or even to desire to seek, God. The Council of Dort declared that only those who have received prior regenerating grace are in fact capable of seeking Him. As you read this book, you will see that God has sovereignly decided to preserve genuine human freedom of choice, and that this brings Him glory and delight. You will also see that predestination is not about who is destined to become a Christian, but about whom a Christian is destined to become." />
