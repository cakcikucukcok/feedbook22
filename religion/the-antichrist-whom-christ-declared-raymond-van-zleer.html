      <meta name="description" content="THE ANTICHRIST WHOM CHRIST DECLARED
A Different Perspective
 Unlike other the antichrist is exposs this book uses the words, teachings, and actions of Jesus Christ to document whom He proclaimed the antichrist to be.
The antichrist whom Jesus Christ actually actively opposed in word and deed.
It confirms this reality using Biblical Scripture and the events of history, even as it focuses upon the present to reveal the antichrist and his wide-ranging scope of satanic actions in todays world  here and now.
TOPICS INCLUDE
How Christianity and by inference, other religions too, unknowingly promote the vile evils seen in todays world.
How Belief, Faith, and the Holy Bible, are cunningly used to justify and support evil, often utilizing the unwitting, and sometimes willing support of believers and the church.
The satanic rationales behind terrorism, environmental destruction and toxic pollution, as well as the ongoing periodic economic crisis, and those who profit from these deliberate satanic deeds.
How the media justifies and promotes evil, including by so-called religious values that brings evil into being, then perpetuates it.
Non-Christian readers will find this book meaningful and useful.
Like Christians, they can use it to identify and counter those who accidentally or deliberately use Jesus Christ and the Holy Bible to abuse religion and promote evils satanic agenda." />
