      <meta name="description" content="Do something that works - Learn of Christ!
Take my yoke upon you, and LEARN OF ME; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall FIND REST unto your souls. (Matthew 11:29)
I have read this scripture many times. Just like many others, I have speed read over the bolded words every time. I rushed to read what Jesus promised - when I take His yoke upon me, rest will come to my soul. Isnt it wonderful that, all we have searched in our lives is so easily promised by Jesus Christ? But hold on a second! Not so fast! Lets see how in our own ways, we have searched for REST until now.
 	We have gone to Church without missing a day, placed our Bibles closer to our bed sides, being active in every Church activities and, giving offerings and tithes without missing a paycheck.
 	We have joined social, cultural and/or religious groups for supports. Also working very hard to save for the future, and taking multiple insurance plans for our lives, health, properties and jobs. In all these, we still couldnt find the much desired REST. 
Well, is not every time you have to search if someone promises you will find!! This time, intelligence doesnt matter. Go back and read the verse again. Jesus said LEARN OF MEyou shall FIND REST. 
Well, not until I began to meditate on this scripture actively, and realized that, we have a responsibility beyond what we are doing currently to FIND REST. We need to LEARN OF CHRIST. 
He said LEARN, not lean. We have speed read LEARN always to mean, LEAN. I have done so many times myself. But no, just like many people, I had been wrong all along.
The rendering of Matthew 11:29 in the New Living Bible, is clearer. 
Take my yoke upon you. LET ME TEACH YOU, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 
Christ wants to teach us how to find rest.  Jesus said LET ME TEACH YOU. So after all, rest wasnt automatic as we lean on Christ. We have a responsibility to do something, just as Christ has a promise to meet. We are to LEARN, He is to teach us! 
In this book, I have written how Christ taught me to REST. REST is found in two key principles  FAITH and DIVINE LOVE. You will learn how, other wide ranging Christian principles are attached to FAITH and DIVINE LOVE. You will learn how to grow in both, and consequently attain REST in your own life. This book presents the HOW not the what. I write as a teacher, so that we can learn.
Through these teachings, I and my family have found rest. We now lived a sickness free, poverty free, and a victory conscious life. I have carried this life also, to others in my calling as a minister of God. Enjoy your read, and remain Blessed in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth." />
