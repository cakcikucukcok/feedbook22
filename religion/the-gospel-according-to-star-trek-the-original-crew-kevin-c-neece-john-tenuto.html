  <title>The Gospel According to Star Trek: The Original Crew - Kevin C. Neece, John Tenuto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What&#39;s Christian about Star Trek? Nothing. That&#39;s the way most people see it and that certainly seems to be the way the franchise is intended. There&#39;s no question that the Trek universe is based on a doggedly humanistic world view and is set in a future time when religion has essentially vanished from Earth. If that&#39;s the case, how can there even be a &quot;gospel according to Star Trek&quot;???In The Gospel According to Star Trek: The Original Crew, you&#39;ll discover how the continuing voyages of Kirk and company aboard the Enterprise--from the original series to the Abramsverse--tell us more about our human quest for God than you ever imagined. You&#39;ll learn how Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry&#39;s own spiritual quest informed the franchise, what he and the series really have to say about God and religion, and the amazing image of Christ contained in Star Trek&#39;s most popular character.??You&#39;ll also see how Star Trek can help us recover a deeper, more fully human gospel that embraces our humanity instead of denigrating it and echoes the call of both Spock and Christ: &quot;Live long and prosper!&quot; (John 10:10)." />
