  <title>Charlie Goodbear - Tom Thunderhorse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. (Marie Curie) The nature of people is to shun the unknown, which is what a handful of people in the town of Springdale were doing to Charlie Goodbear. Charlie Goodbear by Tom Thunderhorse is an inspirational tale about the lives of a few small town folks and a good-hearted and misunderstood man named Charlie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The book begins with a detailed explanation of the characters and the town of Springdale. Thunderhorses perfect description of the stereotypical small town life makes you feel close to the characters. It is as if you are part of the gang and not just a silent spectator. The story unfolds only to pull you deeper into the lives of these colorful characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	A wonderful element this book has to offer is humor, and more than one kind. This book will have its reader laughing as well as sitting in silent amusement at some particular quirk. Do not think for one minute that this book is a comedy, however, it will have you near tears at some points too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	A word of warning to all the books potential readers: This book is religious! Thats right, Ive said the R word. However, what is more important for those who are sensitive about the aforementioned R word, it is not preachy. This story does not attempt to convert you or convince you of the benefits of believing what these characters do believe. Feel safe, people of all faiths, your beliefs are out of harm&#39;s way, so if you can get past the rest of it, just sit back and enjoy the tale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Charlie Goodbear offers an ending that can only be described as bittersweet, but I will not spoil it for any potential readers who may be reading this. You will just have to acquire a copy of this wonderful book for yourself.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left and could say, I used everything you gave me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;~Erma Bombeck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;I have known Tom Thunderhorse for a good amount of time now and knowing him has made this book all the more enjoyable for me. I could hear his voice in my head as I read and his sense of humor and personality comes though in every character. I feel very touched to have been given the opportunity to enjoy his novel before it becomes available to the rest of the world and truly blessed to have met him.&quot;
