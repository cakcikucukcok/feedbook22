  <title>In the Midst of the Storm There Is Purpose - Larry Pratcher, Delmelodia Tipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THIS BOOK COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR EQUIPPING THE SOUL FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS! GOD HAS HIS WAY OF USING SUFFERING FOR PERFECTING THE BODY THROUGH THE HEAD, CHRIST!
In the Midst of the Storm There Is Purpose is a faith base teaching and deliverance manual inspired by the Holy Spirit to open the heart for supernatural surgery. In the Midst of the Storm There Is Purpose is a faith based teaching- study manual for equipping hearts, minds and souls in seasons of distress and turmoil. These impartations are revealed to empower the spirit and mind to greater height, depth and breadth in the power of Yahweh (God) in Yeshua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). Many times during the course of ones life, we may experience crisis that has the capacity to take our breath and direction off range. Often, we may think we have it together; yet, find out that we aren&#39;t as quite together as we may have thought. This spirit-filled manual engages in the spiritual and natural aspects that anyone may experience, no matter the difference types of the storms; pain is pain. As you indulge your heart, spirit and mind will grasp what the Lord is overthrowing in the midst in order to bring you into divine destination, revelation, understanding, wisdom, restoration and supernatural spiritual maturity. Oftentimes, God is using the storm or the crisis to unfold His character from within us, expose the greatness of Himself from within us and to place us in a dimension of knowledge that supersedes increasingly from what we knew about Him and His power. He teaches through the storm how to maneuver and not be overcome by fear, doubt and despair. This manual is a tool targeted to reach those that are suffering, those that need understanding in there time or season of suffering, those that need to know what God is doing in these seasons in their personal life as well as their spiritual life and answers and what is expected of the one who is suffering. God will use pain and suffering to establish His plan of purpose in the life of the soul that will search and seek him from that place. There is promotion and transformation of the mind, soul, spirit and heart that comes as a result of the storm when God intervenes. Some storms are intentional for growth, uprooting, planting, faith elevation, transitioning, maturity, an awakening and settlement of the soul in Jesus Christ and for souls to come to Christ. However, any storm can be used for the purpose of a spiritual awakening; an encounter between the sufferer and God. This manual is written and designed to take you to the next dimension of faith, expose the works of darkness, carnality, reveal your potential and greatness and empower you to step beyond limitations, the pass and bondage into the supernatural according to the Word of God. The manual is filled with Holy Spirit inspired revelation, prophetic declarations, scriptures, prayers and work study for healing and kingdom advancement. This manual is power pact in the wisdom of truth and practical knowledge to bring transformation to your atmosphere; the universe of your mind.
