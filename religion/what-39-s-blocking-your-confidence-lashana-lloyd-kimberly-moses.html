  <title>What&#39;s Blocking Your Confidence? - LaShana Lloyd, Kimberly Moses</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is a lack of confidence having a negative effect on your life? Are you allowing fear to control and paralyze you? What are you allowing to stop you from living the life that God has for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is hope for those who believe that living in fear is the way of life. You no longer have to be bound by fear, you can be set free! In this book, you will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Understand what fear is, and how the enemy (Satan) is using fear against you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find out what happens when you allow fear to override your faith.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Discover why walking in the confidence of God is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to lay your fears to rest and live in the confidence that God has for you. The tools in this book will lead you to the Father&amp;rsquo;s confidence, but it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to walk in it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaShana Lloyd gives encouraging, useful information on what fear is, how the enemy (Satan) gets us to succumb to fear, and the tools that are needed to walk in the confidence that God has given to you. LaShana also uses this book as a form of transparency to let the readers know that she was a victim of living and walking in fear because of a series of events that happened to her, but a desperate cry to God was the first step for her healing process to begin. When LaShana was able to leave her fears behind, she was then able to walk in the confidence that God had waiting for her to receive all along.&lt;/p&gt;" />
