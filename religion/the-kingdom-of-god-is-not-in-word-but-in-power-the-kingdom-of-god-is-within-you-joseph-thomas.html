  <title>The Kingdom of God Is Not in Word, but in Power—The Kingdom of God Is Within You - Joseph Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do you put your faith to work so that God would respond to you?
You might ask how God can reject us, for he is love. If you reject him, he will reject you. But Jesus died a horrible death to keep us out of a horrible place. Just thank him for what you have need of. Say it out loud to him. He is omnipotent (powerful everywhere). Thank you, Lord. I believe you can hear me and you will show me the way through life victoriously. In Jesuss name, amen.
There are so many healings in my life and in many others lives. There are just only millions of testimonies of what God has already done. Just grow up and be like Lord Jesus Christ.
God wants to prepare you today! Dont miss it. Hear his voice. The abundant life can be yours." />
