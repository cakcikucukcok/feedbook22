  <title>Sacred Relationships: Biblical Wisdom for Deepening Our Lives Together - Michael Barclay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the latter part of the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Ketuvim, one may find the world&amp;#39;s first &amp;quot;how-to&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;self-help&amp;quot; book, one that focuses on creating and sustaining human relationships. So says author Rabbi Michael Barclay, who unlocks these writings in a way that reveals new meaning and new relevance for our life with others. Working with ancient sources, Rabbi Barclay demonstrates how each book contains hidden pathways to having a personal, direct, and intimate encounter with God in every relationship and moment of life. He then takes this information, and guides us into using it to deepen our personal relationships with the people around us.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, in the book of Ruth we learn the value of attaching ourselves to a spiritual teacher. Through the Psalms, we learn how to transcend the primary emotions of grief, fear, and desperation, transforming them into joy and gratitude by recognizing God&amp;#39;s presence in al of our feelings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Study groups, individuals looking for spiritual enrichment, and people who want to develop fuller and deeper personal relationships in every aspect of their lives will welcome this positive, practical and intriguing book.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
