  <title>A PROPHETIC LOOK AT ETHIOPIAN JEWS FROM A NUBIAN PERSPECTIVE - Queen of Sheba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is intriguing and will incite curiosity in the reader to explore the myths and facts as they pertain to this Holy relic. Where is the ark of the covenant, and why has it been such a controversial icon for generations? Who was in possession of the ark of the covenant, and what impact has it had on nations? This ark, for so many, represented the presence, purpose and power of God. Were the possessors of the ark favored by God? If so, how do we reconcile this with the sufferings that the Ethiopians have had to endure? For they say they have the ark and continue to nurture and preserve it in the Mary Zion Sanctuary in Axum. These questions have been thoroughly addressed by the author and will hopefully leave the reader with a newfound respect for the Ethiopian Jews.&lt;/p&gt;" />
