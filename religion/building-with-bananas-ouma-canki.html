  <title>Building with Bananas - Ouma Canki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An autobiography of a womans growth into Christian maturity as
she struggled to understand as well as experience the fullness of
a personal relationship with God and to understand the difference
between presumptuous faith and the faith that God honours.
To help her develop this unshakable faith and trust in God,
while entering into His rest, she had to experience victory in
many traumatic circumstances.
Romans 8:verses 37-39 Yet in all these things we are more than
conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am persuaded
that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor
powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor
depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us
from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." />
