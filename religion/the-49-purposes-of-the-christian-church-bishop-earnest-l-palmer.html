  <title>The 49 Purposes of the Christian Church - Bishop Earnest L. Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Christian Church has transformed itself many times since its tenets took root and after the mostly violent deaths of the original apostles. Consequently, the contemporary church may resemble the original intent of its apostolic fathers only slightly and may have subsequently assumed an identity and life of its own. The original footprint of the first-century church could not easily fit the church, as it has evolved after coming through reformations, denominations, attacks by rival religions, and the tactics and tenets of Christian zealots, theological debates, and fairly exhaustive apologetics.
The intent of this book is to navigate the reader through the murky waters of theological distortions and religious bias to the calmer and clearer seas of divine intent and purpose. The 49 Purposes of the Christian Church is not a comprehensive treatise on the purposeful design of the Christian Church from any denominational bias or perspective; however, it does lend itself to the basics of evangelism and congregational order as defined or implied in New Testament scripture.
