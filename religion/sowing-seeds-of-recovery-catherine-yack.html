  <title>Sowing Seeds of Recovery - Catherine Yack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this powerful, life changing book, Catherine Yack now shares how she recovered from over two decades of drug and alcohol abuse, along with many other obstacles in her life. I didnt do it alone. Ive had many individuals in my life who have sown seeds in me, and it is the fruit of these seeds that I now pass on to others. Sowing Seeds of Recovery is not just about recovery from drugs or alcohol. It is about recovery from the pains and traumas of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine Yacks book, Sowing Seeds of Recovery, shares timely truths and spiritual advice for this generation of believers. I believe this book is a must-read for anyone. Especially those who are navigating through the world of addiction and the drug culture. This book bridges gaps, with a common meeting ground for handling situations that come up in everyday life. It will also give anyone a starting place, or a restart on understanding Scripture and Gods love. &lt;br /&gt;
Steve Box, author of Meth = Sorcery, The Leviathan, and co-author of Life After Meth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine Yack, in her book, shares the healing power from the telling of the story, when reflected in testimony of Gods love for us, while blending compassion from the Heart of God. Powerful book - powerful stories - foundational and complete. The reader is brought to a place of understanding that God is a God of relationship and we can know Him in a real way. The foundation of this book is based on the wisdom from the Word of God validating that the answers to life can be found in the Bible. &lt;br /&gt;
