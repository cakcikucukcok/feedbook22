  <title>From a Caterpillar to a Butterfly - Barbara Crincoli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Struggling for identity is something we all go through. Some of us struggle more than others, but in the final analysis, our choices result in consequences, good or bad. However, it does not mean that we know who we are. It just means that we want to be the best &quot;me&quot; we can be. Being satisfied with where you are can cause stagnation. Being willing to forge ahead in spite of obstacles makes you stronger. Not that we should not be content with ourselves; we should. However, our highest goal should be to have the best that God has to offer us. Choose to take God&#39;s roadmap for your life, not what society says your life should be. Journey with Barbara as she shares her life and her heart in her struggle for identity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
