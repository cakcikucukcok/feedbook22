  <title>The Divine Grace of Sri Shirdi Sai Baba - Satya Pal Ruhela</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sri Shirdi Sai Baba (18381918), the first one in the trinity of Sai Baba Avatars (incarnations), was the incarnation of Lord Shiva. He led the life of an ideal Sufi saintbegging for alms; helping all, teaching the basics of morality and spirituality in his typical rural, rustic, simple, and lively manner, telling true stories of many births of his devotees and other creatures, and by his very brief and heart-penetrating comments and pieces of advice. 
He taught all to believe in God, who is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, and the One Malik (Master) of all and who is present in every creature. Gods grace can be achieved by anyone by earnestly remembering Him; by being moral, kind, and loving to all creatures, and by doing ones duties honestly and sincerely. Sai Baba always gave genuine assurances to those who called upon him for his miraculous grace and helped the distressed ones instantly. It is a well-known fact that Sri Shirdi Sai Babas grace is being experienced by countless people throughout the world, but only a few of such incidents are published in Sai journals and on the Internet. 
This book is a collection of invaluable articles on Sri Shirdi Sai Babas legendary grace and thrilling record of over two hundred testimonies of post-Samadhi period (after 1918 till now) beneficiaries of his grace. His temples are in India, USA, UK, Canada, China, South Africa, Mauritius, and many countries. Thousands of pilgrims visit daily his Dwarka Mai Masjid and Samadhi Mandir in Shirdi (India) and Sai temples in their countries daily to obtain his gracious help. 
All those who are eager to receive Sri Shirdi Babas divine grace for getting instant solution of and relief in their problems and seek proper guidance shall find this book a boon." />
