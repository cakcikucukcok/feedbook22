  <title>Qur’An-Bible Comparison - Ami Ben-Chanan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As one of the biggest and most rapidly growing religions, the Islamic faith attracts a lot of attention and debates. The last sixty years have been witness to innumerable conflicts between Muslims and Jews, and Muslims and the western world (notably Christians). Many famous people have accepted Islam, and increasing numbers of westerners are becoming Muslims every year. Muslim scholars loudly proclaim that the Quran is the only Holy Book sent by God, and Islam is the last religion, the purpose of which is to spread its tenets around the globe and to build a world-wide Caliphate. 
The attack and subsequent destruction of the World Trade Towers in New York City on September 11, 2001, motivated author Ami Ben-Chanan to pose this question: Does the Quran mention a Holy War against those who do not believe in Allah as God and in Mohammed as Gods Prophet? In studying the Quran in detail, he discovered many biblical events and characters that seem to run parallel. Or do they? Intrigued, he decided to bring all references together into one file and compare them to each other. The result is &lt;i&gt;Quran-Bible Comparison,&lt;/i&gt; a compendium that provides the facts needed to fully explore this question." />
