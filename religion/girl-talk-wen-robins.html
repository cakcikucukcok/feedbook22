  <title>Girl Talk - Wen Robins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whats preventing you from achieving your goals and living your dreams? Are you stuck in your comfort zone? Or do you lack discipline? Are you easily distracted? Or do you fear failure, success, or the unknown? Are you holding on to negative memories from your past? Or are you shackled by the chains of unforgiveness? Are you afflicted with low self-esteem? Or do you simply need guidance and encouragement to get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many reasons, women get stuck in a rut and lose sight of their dreams. This is the first of the Girl Talk series, where the author shares her life experiences in an attempt to motivate and empower women of all ages. Girl Talk: Leaving the Past Behind You gives you the inside scoop on getting past the past, designing your destiny, and living your dreams. It encourages you to step out of your comfort zone and step into the prosperous, hope-filled life that God has destined for you. In the final chapter, Wen shares a story about her personal encounter with an angel she refers to as JB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Girl Talk series aims to empower women to be inspired by God to live a purpose-filled life and to reach incredible goals. In a world where media has influenced women to use external beauty to achieve successes, this book reminds you that it is through the transformation of your mind that change occurs and through your thoughts that you become who you are. Stop allowing the pain of your past to hinder your present. Learn to forgive; learn the importance of positive energy; understand the power of faith and go for it!&lt;/p&gt;" />
