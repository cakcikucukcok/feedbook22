  <title>A Christian&#39;s Guide to Tactics of Spiritual Warfare: How and Why God and Jesus Will Win - Kevin Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Christians Guide to Tactics of Spiritual Warfare: How and why God and Jesus will Win, is a book written in first person and tells minor details of my life.  The books main objective is to show you different tactics of how to ward off evil to becoming closer to God.
This book is my opinionated interpretation of spiritual warfare and is a tactics guide to learning a different way of viewing Christianity.  It is a combination of perception and psychology and how it relates to you finding the kingdom of God on earth.  Furthermore, it gives examples of situations to be aware of daily and how you should react and why.  It is my interpretation of Gods Word and the Bible.  It elaborates on the role of Jesus Christ, how he plays an important role in human hearts, how he has a desire to enter the righteous hearts of those who confess their sins and pray.  Through Gods Word in the Bible and the sacrifice of Jesus, we all are redeemed by the blood of Christ, making us brothers and sisters in Christ." />
