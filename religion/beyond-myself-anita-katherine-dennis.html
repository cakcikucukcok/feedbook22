  <title>Beyond Myself - Anita Katherine Dennis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When author Anita Katherine Dennis walked into the anthropology class during her sophomore year at Ohio University in 1964, she was sure the class would prove interesting. She had no idea how right she would be. In Beyond Myself, she narrates the love story that developed between her and her anthropology professor, Dr. Ben Dennis, an African tribal chief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, she shares how God sustained her during her interracial, cross-cultural marriageespecially as she played the role of chiefs wife in a remote village in Liberia, West Africa. Her life was full of extremes. She met the president of Liberia in the Executive Mansionand slept in a mud hut. She visited European capitalsand lived in a remote African village. She flew on transatlantic flightsand was carried through the high forest in a chiefs hammock. Anita shares her struggles as she is accepted into the Mende tribe and lived in Vahun with an off and on kerosene fridge, swarming termites on the screens, a cyclone barely missing the house, and pungent elephant meat delivered in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Myself offers an example of West meets Africa personified. Anita tells how life with Ben was more than a marriage. It was an education and adventure wrapped into one. Ben allowed Anita to escape her narrow cultural confines and embark on a journey from farm girl to global citizen, with plenty of missteps throughout.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&quot;....Dennis led a life filled with remarkable events and translated them into an entertaining memoir....overall she proves to be a storyteller with a keen eye for detail and fully re-creates the complexities of her marriage and the exciting challenges she faced in Africa. A cleareyed memoir about navigating fraught relationships and other cultures.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
