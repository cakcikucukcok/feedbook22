  <title>Who&#39;s ? Right - Kelly Warman-Stallings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Understanding mankind is composed of first learning the existence of mankinds beginnings and from there we [mankind] may learn where the final destination of existence ends. At one time or another, all of humankind has wondered and contemplated upon where this race of Earthly people came from and how it was possible for humanity to be so complexly assembled. It is the greatest unsolved mystery of mankind.
The religions of the world are absolutely overwhelming in our modern times! There are many different groups, sects, cults and factions that teach numerous scenarios of a great Creator and his many accomplishments, commandments and judgments. Religion is basically the enlightenment of teaching mankind how to live a virtuous life and how to prepare for a final judgment. The majority of religious institutions hold fast to this theory. The three major religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism) may have different beliefs, dissimilar concepts and contrasting traditional values, but they share very similar eschatological theories. 
A doomsday scenario and a final judgment of mankind is shared by the majority of religions in the world today and many believe that era of doom is imminent. This certain era will also bring about a time of peace and destroy evil. Known as the End of the Age, the End Times and the Last Days, this theory of the end of the world has been incorporated in many religious creeds. Christianity believes the End Times will herald in the return of their savior, Jesus. Islam believes the Last Days will be a final assessment of humanity by Allah before the final judgment. And, in Judaism it refers to the messianic era [at the End of the Age] when a global peace will usher in an epoch conductive to furthering mankind&#39;s knowledge of the Creator." />
