  <title>Begging Faith  (Vol. 1, Lipstick and War Crimes Series): Identifying the Assault on Virtue and Family - Ray Songtree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Begging Faith: The Assault on Virtue and Family &lt;/em&gt;is the Christian edition of Vol. 1 of the&lt;em&gt; Lipstick and War Crimes Series&lt;/em&gt;. Vol 1 introduces us to the mind boggling reality of gender sculpting, using some of the female icons of the last 70 years, and shows that the assault on family values is not random. Yes, there is a reason there is so much experimentation and confusion! What we thought was independent creative talent ends up being organized programming. Who is trying to change our idea of &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; and why?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The true history of Marilyn Monroe, Katherine Hepburn, Gloria Steinem, Madonna, Shirley McClain, Miley Cyrus, Beyonc&amp;eacute; Knowles, Angelina Jolie,&amp;nbsp; Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Jane Fonda, Alice Walker and more, comes to light in this expos&amp;eacute; on feminism and our scripted ideas of gender and blurred gender.&amp;nbsp; Henry Kissinger, Barack Obama, and Warren Beatty come onstage to show us the male side of the program.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are all slowly waking up to the fact we have been socially engineered our entire lives. With study, the word Satanic becomes forensic. Though we can grasp that history might have been distorted in schools, it is more difficult to imagine that our values have been programmed by an organized media and that celebrities are created for that purpose. We usually take the world&amp;#39;s values for granted. Now you won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lipstick refers to exaggerated feminine energy, and war crimes refers to exaggerated male energy. &lt;em&gt;Begging Faith&lt;/em&gt; is replete with over 100 color images and over 50 references for your wondering mind.&amp;nbsp; It includes a special introduction for Christian readers, a 20 page photo essay that introduces the larger Series,&amp;nbsp; and a bio about the author.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The celebrity stories combined with the deep discussion of values will interest readers of all ages. This series was specifically written to reach a younger audience and can be a tool in convincing young people that moral coordinates are essential to a healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
