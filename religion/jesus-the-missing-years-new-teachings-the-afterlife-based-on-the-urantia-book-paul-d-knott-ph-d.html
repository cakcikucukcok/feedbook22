  <title>Jesus – the Missing Years,  New Teachings  &amp; the Afterlife:  Based on the Urantia Book - Paul D. Knott Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The afterlife is open to all persons, religious or non-religious, from all over the world. Our destiny, after this short life is over, is conditioned only by our spiritual longings and purposes. It is not determined by believing in a correct creed or dogma or by saying the correct words. Rather, we will pass on to the afterlife if we have the faintest desire to know more of God, more of truth, beauty, and goodness. This is a teaching found in The Urantia Book that purports to be a revelation to Earth, which the authors call Urantia. The present book is a brief introduction to The Urantia Book, a complex tome of over 2,000 pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Urantia Book claims to have answers to such timeless questions as: What happens to us when we die? Is there a heaven; if so, what is it like? Is God really love? Has God really set aside a hell in which people who reject him are punished? How do we get to heaven? How did Earth become such a confused and troubled planet? How do we move forward? What is the origin of human life? Many, many more teachings are found in The Urantia Book, including teachings by Jesus that weve never heard before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you will find explanations from The Urantia Book that clear up misconceptions of God, some of Jesus teachings, the nature of the universe and the afterlife; misconceptions which have often caused confusion, heartache, and irrational fear in people all over the world. &lt;/p&gt;" />
