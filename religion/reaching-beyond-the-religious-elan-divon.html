  <title>Reaching Beyond the Religious - Elan Divon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a groundbreaking comparison between the Biblical and Hindu traditions,
&lt;i&gt;Reaching Beyond the Religious&lt;/i&gt; reveals a wisdom that transcends time, culture and
creed, and which has the power to transform the way we think about religion
in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dispelling the idea that we can create our destinies by tapping into the power of our
intentions, the book flips the paradigm on its head and challenges our basic assumptions
about the world, God, and the human enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaving between mythology and reality, East and West, the book unearths seven universal
wisdom themes from across the religious spectrum and maps these onto the
complexities of modern day life. From Genesis, Job and the Hindu god, Shiva, to the
dramatic Presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama; from the life
stories of Biblical Patriarchs and Hindu icons to those of contemporary greats such
as J.K. Rowling, Michael Jordan, and Warren Buffett, this is a book that charts the
teachings of the past onto the present while exploring humankinds most pressing and
difficult questions. Supported by compelling examples taken from nature, pop culture,
and religious text; prepare to be enlightened, entertained, and inspired by &lt;i&gt;Reaching Beyond
the Religious&lt;/i&gt;." />
