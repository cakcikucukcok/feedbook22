  <title>This Happened - Faith Reise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A real-life tragedy occurred at the birth of Faiths granddaughter. They were not expecting this, and it became an experience that changed their lives forever. They went through many encounters of sadness and grief, not knowing from minute to minute what was going to happen. They faced many fears and became close to many different people. Everything Faith wrote about is the truth. They became very humble, and they counted on prayer. 
It is an inspiration to anyone who reads it. Everyone goes through something in life where this book will be of much help. While reading this book, you will be captured in the connection with Faith and all she went through. Your heart will be connected to hers. If you have lost hope, after reading this book, you will be filled with hope and love again. Faith was inspired by her husband to write this book after she realized that it would and could help so many people. Anyone who reads this will be inspired and thankful they took the time to read it. Their lives will change as well. 
Her inspiration is just to help people. As you read it, you will find the many things that happened she had no idea was going to happen. Her faith in God helped her through everything she encountered. As she trusted God, doors opened for her that have never closed. She hopes this book can convey to you the love it gave to her in writing it." />
