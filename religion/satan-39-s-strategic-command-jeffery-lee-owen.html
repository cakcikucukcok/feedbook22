  <title>Satan&#39;s Strategic Command - Jeffery Lee Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The word of God presents to humanity our pathway of reconciliation to our Heavenly Father! Holy Writ also presents to mankind the origins of evil, its effects on the human condition down through the centuries, and finally its ultimate isolation and eradication from the universe! Eternal or absolute truth is our pathway of reconciliation to our Heavenly Father! &lt;br&gt;
As the Christian brethren seek to follow our lord and savior Jesus Christ, growing in the spirit, breaking the bonds of slavery to Satan and sin, the carnal man is trapped in the darkness of his ignorance to the spirit of death and the wages of his sin!&lt;br&gt;
The light of Gods word reveals the natural manifestation of evil and its impact on the condition of the human soul! &lt;br&gt;
Thus the noblest of men can perceive the effects of evil, and the benevolence of father God, in the inner man as the effects of transgression impact our natural world!&lt;br&gt;
The spirit of rebellion and its work is revealed in our natural world via the transgression of Gods commandments enslaving the masses to its power as the unaware continue in the blindness of their hearts!&lt;br&gt;
The word of God has warned men to beware of the existence of  evil as the condemned angels and the arch rebel Satan work to escape the judgments of Almighty God, building an army of  rebellious and Satanic adherents, marked by the seal of their master Satan as revealed in the work of their hands and the pleasures of their hearts, thus perfecting rebellion for the human race as the manifestation of the personification of evil evinces itself for the crowning of Satans throne as the rebel of Almighty God!" />
