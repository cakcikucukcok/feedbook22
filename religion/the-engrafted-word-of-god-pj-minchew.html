  <title>The Engrafted Word of God - Pj Minchew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every scribe who is instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man that is a householder, which brings forth out of his treasurers things new and old.  Our love for God grows faster than our knowledge, then our understanding has a great desire to seek to know God even more closely and personal, we rest only in perfect knowledge of God.  Our love begins and ends in knowing Him.  This perfectly unites us to God in the closeness of solitary visions, our whole heart, mind, and soul.  Perfection is in love.  Our earthly knowledge is changed in God&#39;s perfect light, if we stay in it.  The perfected knowledge that God alone gives us is the knowledge that ascends.  At first, we saw dimly, but then, face to face.  We are allowed to interpret the mysteries of His Holy Word.  We may bring in certain sayings of which we know the interpretation would lead the hearers into the innermost sanctuary of that truth, which is hidden.
The Engrafted Word perfects purity, and slays death by the Lord&#39;s presence, which is the presence of His discernment.  After the slaying of death, the disciple of Divine Knowledge is illuminated.  The Word of the LORD is pure, and remains so eternally.  But those who have not come to know God, which is the Holy Union of The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit, merely speculates, engrafting their own thoughts and inventions which is diluting the Word of God.  Purity makes it&#39;s disciple a theologian of God, who of themselves , grasp the doctrines.  It is written &quot;Receive with meekness, the Engrafted Word of God, which is able to save your souls.&quot;  The true aim of our Christian life consists in the acquisition of the Holy Spirit of God.  Only the good deeds done for Christ&#39;s sake bring us the fruits of the Holy Spirit." />
