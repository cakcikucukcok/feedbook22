  <title>Culture That Kills - Naomi Watchman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a culture tailor made just for you and me, and unless we suit up for war, and war with knowledge, we will be overthrown. This culture actively scouts to seduce Children of God, once delivered by THE LIGHT, back behind enemy lines, back into the LIEs false system of redemption. We must know our positioning in the Kingdom of Light, and operate in that positioning.  
Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy. (John 10:10) Never underestimate Satans motive to destroy you.  Always know that Satan is a manslayer.  A murderer from the beginning. (John 8:44)
This book is written to the Brethren as a jolt.  A trigger to awaken the senses out of slumber.  An admonish to put on the whole armor of God daily, and fight the good fight of faith.
The Kingdom of Darkness has injected The LIE (Satans power) into time and every moment is now a battle for your soul. 
Brethren, we must be on alert and contend for the faith once delivered unto the saints. We must wrestle to maintain our Victory in Christ.  We must wrestle to maintain our Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free.  We must stand on THE STANDARD and not tap out.
Will you contend?  
ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
(Jude 1:3)
Contend: to struggle for: - earnestly contend for (Reference: Strongs Concordance)" />
