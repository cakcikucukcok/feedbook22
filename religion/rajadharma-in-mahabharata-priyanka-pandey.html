  <title>Rajadharma in Mahabharata - Priyanka Pandey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;About The Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The idea of politics hardly finds an expression elsewhere as clearly as in Maha?bha?rata. This work thus investigates the political thought explicit in S?a?nti-Parva and emphasizes that Maha?bha?rata is a text in the study of politics, apart from the perception of it being a great epic and a text of high literary value. Whatever be the notion of politics we contemplate upon, it finds an articulation in Maha?bha?rata. As the Greek tradition of thinking is the base of Western politics, S?a?nti-Parva of Maha?bha?rata represents the Indian notion of political thinking, though there remain many similarities and dissimilarities between the two systems.&lt;br /&gt;
This volume navigates one to how to read Maha?bha?rata as a political text; the idea of political thoughts, the constituting principles of politics and the political institutions in S?a?nti-Parva; and the relevance of these political thoughts in modern time. Topics such as dan?d?ani?ti, origin of state, the seven elements of state, functions of state, types of state, kinship, judiciary and administration are discussed in detail, among many other issues of political importance.&lt;br /&gt;
The book collects, analyses and examines the internal evidences from S?a?nti-Parva and also from other parvans of Maha?bha?rata to reach a decisive conclusion, making the work a composite result of textual analysis, related literature and subjective contemplation. It clearly shows that the idea of politics is not separated from the idea of ethics. Rather they are intertwined.&lt;br /&gt;
