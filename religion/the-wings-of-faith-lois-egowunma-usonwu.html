  <title>The Wings of Faith - Lois Egowunma Usonwu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The background to the Wings of Faith was introduced with a divine call through a dream in which the Lord mandated the writer to effectively share her faith in writing with testimonies of the several wonderful things the Lord has done in her life in response to her faith in Jesus Christ and her prayers and cries to God for help in every areas of her challenges from which she has found relevance and purpose in life, as referenced in Philemon 1:6&quot;That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wings of Faith is a catalogue of testimonies of my faith, testifying that since I gave my life to Christ through faith in the name of Jesus as the Son of God and as my Lord and personal Savior through confession and repentance and forsaking of my sins and baptism by immersion, daily reading, and studying of the Bible and prayer and fellowship with the brethren and faith in the word of God, which I communicate to God through prayer by the help of the Holy Spirit, my life has never been the same again. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Word of God that I pray with bears fruit, which results to testimonies. As a widow, God has shown me his faithfulness as the husband of the widow and as the father of the fatherless to my children. He has pleaded my case against opposition, defended the cause of my children, did not leave us as orphans but revealed things to come so as to warn us, relieved us of burdens, provided for us, healed us, intervened in very difficult situations and made ways of escape for us, helped us and sent helpers to us, raised us up from the dust, lifted us up from the ash heap, brought us out of darkness, and translated us into his marvelous light that we should show forth his praises. This is the praise of God, the testimony of Jesus, that he called us to bear fruits of testimony to bring glory to his name and encourage people who hear our testimonies to have faith in God by believing in the name of Jesus Christ, his Son, so that Jesus Christ in turn will draw them to the Father, who is pleased to give us the kingdom, that through faith in the name of Jesus, we might reign with him in his kingdom and live eternally to the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
