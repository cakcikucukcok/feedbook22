  <title>A Miracle Before Our Eyes - Bonnie Rider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been at a place where you needed to sense Gods love and encouragement afresh, or known someone who needed to be reminded of Gods love and encouragement? Maybe youve even thought, If only I had something I could share with them to encourage them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Miracle before Our Eyes is the journey of a pastors wife as God teaches her to trust Him deeply following discovery of a brain tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Miracle before Our Eyes takes place with a mother robin choosing my kitchen windowsill to hatch and nurture three different robin families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I watched the mother and father robin care for their chicks, I was amazed at how their actions illustrated Gods love to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gods love is unending.&lt;br&gt;
 His love never fails.&lt;br&gt;
Gods love is unselfish.&lt;br&gt;
 His love is for everyone.&lt;br&gt;
Gods love is unconditional.&lt;br&gt;
 It is a free gift and not dependent on what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have a situation in your lifejob loss, teenage rebellion, marriage unrest, parents who are ill or aging, single parenthood, or medical concerns that fill your life with dread. God could be using your situation to draw you closer to understanding His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you sit back and enjoy A Miracle before Our Eyes, you may be encouraged  and you just might find a tool to help you encourage a friend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
