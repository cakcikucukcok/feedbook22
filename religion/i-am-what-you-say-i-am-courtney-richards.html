In this liberating and enriching book, Courtney Richards asks the questions:
Whose dream are you living?
Whose words should you trust?

Our mind is one of our greatest assets and in order to do well in life, we must first think well. As we change our thinking we can live a fulfilled and vibrant
life en route to achieving our purpose.
In order to expose limiting thinking we need to recognise and examine our current thinking.
How do you see your world  Harmful? Deficient? Restrictive? What often lies beneath these beliefs is an unseen conflict.
Learn ways to:
 Recognise damaging thoughts that can influence your life
 Use your mind constructively
 Live the ULTIMATE DREAM
Inspiring, uplifting and illuminating, I Am What You Say I Am looks at strategies to live a divinely inspired purpose driven life.
