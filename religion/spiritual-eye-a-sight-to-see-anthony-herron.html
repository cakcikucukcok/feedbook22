  <title>&quot;Spiritual Eye, a Sight  to See&quot; - Anthony Herron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered why you end up doing things that you cannot answer? What made you do that? Or, what was I thinking? Or even, I did it again! Maybe after you read this book, it might give you a better understanding about a lot of the wrong turns we make in our life that we lose control of.
?This is a story of a young man that was brought up in church his whole life and was given a gift to be able to see what we are not able to see. These are the demons that try all day and night to trick and deceive us into hurting and lying to each other. They also try to kill us in hopes that we do not make it into heaven. This young man will do everything in his powers to see that the demons do not succeed. He will try and block every attempt that the demons bring his way by using his gift and with the help of the best friend that we have on earth, the Holy Spirit, as well as the holy warrior angels that God has placed here on earth to protect and watch over us." />
