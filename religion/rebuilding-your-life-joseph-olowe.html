  <title>Rebuilding Your Life - Joseph Olowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The most common thing in life is CHANGE. The weather changes. Leadership changes. Policies change. And we &amp;mdash; yes &amp;mdash; we also change! Our lives do change as a result of decisions and indecisions. Some changes are trivial; others are drastic. What do we do when what has become of us seems far different from God&amp;rsquo;s dream for us? Or to ask the same question in the language of the psalmist, if the foundation be destroyed, what can the righteous do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding Your Life answers this question by exploring the story of one man who wrought such a transformation successfully. The walls of Jerusalem were broken down and the gates burned with fire. This is not just any wall &amp;mdash; walls so wide and so strong that people built houses thereon. But in 52 days, Nehemiah rebuilt the wall and got the job done. However, not without opposition&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With devotional-type chapters with practicable tasks at the end of each chapter, Dr. Joseph Olowe drew practical life applications from the story of Nehemiah to clear out the pathway that leads to restoration and transformation in different areas of life &amp;mdash; in relationships, finance, business, health, and spirituality. This is a must-read if you are looking forward to living in the reality of your best life yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
