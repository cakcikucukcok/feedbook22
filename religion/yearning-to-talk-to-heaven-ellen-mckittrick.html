  <title>Yearning to Talk to Heaven - Ellen McKittrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if it were possible to talk to your loved ones in Heaven?&lt;br /&gt;
Kenley is holding a stuffed animal.&lt;br /&gt;
Kathy Bear, Leia broke down and cried I looked everywhere for that bear. I put it in her coffin.&lt;br /&gt;
What if they could tell you what they are doing now?&lt;br /&gt;
I see your Gram sitting in a golf cart laughing and driving crazy.&lt;br /&gt;
Ask her if my Uncle is with her.&lt;br /&gt;
I see a blue Jay.&lt;br /&gt;
Yep, that is my Uncle Jay. He loved to golf.&lt;br /&gt;
What is going on in places?&lt;br /&gt;
I am in a large room at Waverly Sanatorium.&lt;br /&gt;
What do you see in here? the guide asks me.&lt;br /&gt;
I see bodies, lots of dead bodies. You can almost smell the dead. I turned&lt;br /&gt;
to him and asked, What was in here?&lt;br /&gt;
Dead bodies.&lt;br /&gt;
Could see what will happen in the future?&lt;br /&gt;
The day it happens is a beautiful sunny one. The Earth shifts, Florida and other southern&lt;br /&gt;
gulf states drop hundreds of feet to the ocean floor. They die in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;
We all have a direct connection to God. Im using mine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
