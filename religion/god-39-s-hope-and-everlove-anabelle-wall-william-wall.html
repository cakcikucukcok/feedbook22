  <title>God&#39;s Hope and Everlove - Anabelle Wall, William Wall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The stories in this book are not imaginations but real and taken from our own life story. God leads us and speaks to our hearts to share the goodness of God in my own life. This is a great proof that God is real and always there in times of need. This book is a living proof that our God did not change since before or now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a compilation of living testimonies. This book consists of two parts. Part I is entitled Restoring Manifestations by the first author of this book. Part II is entitled Miracles, Signs, and Wonders by the second author of this book. God can do miracles in our lives. Only He can make the unexpected beautiful things for our lives. I have compiled all the stories in my life as a proof that God is alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our lives, we have proven that the Bible is a great sword of life to cling on. Every verse in the Bible is real and Gods breathe, giving life to the bones and guidance to every believer. May this book serve as an inspiration, hope, light, and encouragement to your life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
