  <title>Forever - Betty Lowrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ellens witness has aided and abetted Anne in a life of change. The mousey, easily intimidated Anne has become a beauty with firm convictions. She no longer allows her ex-husband, Andrew, to walk all over her. In fact, her firmness has made Andrew believe there might be something to being a Christian after all, but hes still checking it out. Bitty struggled through her first husbands illness and death and vowed she would never remarry, but the chief of police broke her resolve. Chester Mayfield is in the throes of an illness no one saw coming. It is a life or death situation and no one knows who will win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then theres Harriet and her daughter, Marigold, learning to accept each other. It isnt easy. Harriet may have appeared to be a recluse for many years, but now that she has rejoined society, the group of friends realize Harriet is a woman of substance and retains authority. Everyone needs a friend like Harriet! But Harriets reach does not faze Marigold, whose personality is as strong as her mothers. A few tangles lead to an understanding, and the two learn to operate together. Marigold takes on Haley, a girl from prison, and each woman deals with the man in her life. It happens that Marigold and Ellen have what some might call,  the cream of the crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Matt and Dan can show Andrew the way. But who will show the way to the new girl, Haley, who is fresh out of prison? Andrew says it takes a con to know one, and he is studying this girl with the rebellious nature. Only time will tell if Haley Marie Gipson lasts on the outside.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The judge is looking over Andrews shoulder, and U.S. Marshall Bodie is keeping tabs on Haley and her parents, Dorothy and Harper Gipson. Remember, too, little Ruthie has a gift God will use in their lives, when evil seems to run rampant, God shines through this small childs love and eases the hurt in Haley.&lt;/p&gt;" />
