  <title>The Next Step: A Model for Personal Discipleship - Stanley P. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once you come to know Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, what is the next step? If you have been a believer for a while and want to grow further, what is the next step? If you have grown in your faith and want to learn how to help other believers grow in theirs, what is the next step? This book will begin to answer these important questions. In Peter&#39;s second letter to scattered believers, he challenges us to add seven character qualities to our faith that will help us grow to be more like Christ. The Next Step looks at these seven character qualities, along with God&#39;s corresponding attributes, to help us grow in these qualities as we grow in our understanding of God&#39;s character. In every chapter, Johnson introduces readers to prayer, grace, and practical ways to begin reaching out to the people God places in our lives. The Next Step will help you grow in your daily walk with the Lord and will launch you on a lifelong journey of investing in others to help them walk with Christ." />
