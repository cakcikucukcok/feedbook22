      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author has defined the substance of faith as the real physical matter of which a person or thing consists of, and having a tangible solid presence. If this is the case, then we can see, hear and feel this substance the Bible has always defined as faith. Many Greats have gone before us and taught us much on faith being the substance. Faith, Man&amp;#39;s Grip On God takes the reader into a journey of the unknown to discover what real substance is. You can get a grip on God&amp;#39;s heart, you can captivate Him, you can turn His attention towards you and His eyes upon you, and this is all because of this&amp;nbsp;substance.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This book will change your tomorrow by what you speak today and guide you into a deeper relationship with God and His word. Whosoever shall say whatsoever shall have whatsoever. Mark 11:23&lt;/p&gt;" />
