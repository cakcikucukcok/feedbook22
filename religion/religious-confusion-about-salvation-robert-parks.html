  <title>Religious Confusion About Salvation - Robert Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title really sums up what this book is all about. Very few people would question that when the word religion is mentioned, the word confusion is not far behind it. And although the word religion could encompass many things, I speak of the Christian religion as found in the Bible. There are very few people that have not heard of the Bible. It is, as most would agree, the Word of God. What they wont agree on is what it says. Although there are many issues in the Bible that are confusing and challenging, I have chosen what I believe is the most important one: how to enter into a saving relationship with God the Father through God the Son (Jesus). For the sake of understanding, I will entitle this Gods plan of salvation. What is it God that wants us to do (obedience) to put our self in a place where He can save us? The Bible teaches us that God sent His only Son (Jesus) into the world that we might be saved by His sacrifice. The Bible also teaches that not everyone will be saved. So it stands to reason that there is something we must do to receive the salvation that God holds out for all. This then is the reason for this book. When considering this issue, it is vitally important to consider the whole of what the Bible has to say on this issue. Many in the Christian world love to pull one verse from its content and form Gods plan (e.g. John 3:16). When writing this work, I considered the entire New Testament." />
