  <title>Present Day Truth - Nellie Looper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why are so many of Gods people living defeated lives in todays Christian society? That is a good question and I am sure everyone has an opinion as to the answer. Being a pastor I can tell you that the biggest failure for the church today lies within the ministry. We must get back to teaching Gods people how to line their lives up to the word of God. 
Romans 10:1-3 speaks of Israel being ignorant of Gods righteousness. Because of their ignorance they go about establishing their own righteousness. I believe that the Christian world today can wear that scripture in bright orange. We have become a mixed breed of Christians. We have mixed the word of God and tried to fit it to the lifestyle we want to live. It is high time to break down the walls of tradition and religion and get to the root of our sin problem. We must come to a place of worshipping God in spirit and truth. 
This teaching is based on Revelations chapter 21 concerning the eight sins that will separate us from the presence of God. I have shared some of my own personal experiences with you in hopes that you might understand the need to clean up your hearts and lives to be able to receive the promise of life. There is a way into that promised life but the word in Matthew 7:14 tells us that few will find the way. My hope and prayer is that this book will help you find that narrow road that will lead you into the life that God wants you to have." />
