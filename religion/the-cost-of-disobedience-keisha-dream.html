  <title>The Cost of Disobedience - Keisha Dream</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Cost of Disobedience, is designed to give us an understanding about how God feels about his instructions, and how important it is for us to obey them.  However, this topic is a sensitive subject to talk about, and is directed to every human being, especially those who believe and has a relationship with the Lord Almighty.  This subject is sensitive because we can&#39;t blame or look to anybody but ourselves in regards to our choices.  No one can obey God for us, it is something we have to do deal with individually.  It is also the very thing that we can hide from other&#39;s and appear as if we are pleasing God completely.  None of us want to hear that we are being disobedient to anything, and or anybody especially God.  However, obeying God is something we need to hear and be reminded to do, since disobedience appears as a silent blessing stealer; and is the core reason why so many of us have not received our promises, even though we are doing a lot of things God has instructed us to do as believers.  Remember obedience is better than sacrifice. This book is not designed to condemn us but to give us knowledge about God, and truth about the consequences of our disobedience towards God. God wants us to walk away after reading this book with a strong desire and drive to obey him, so we can receive everything he has promised.  God said if we love him, then we should follow his commands.  So obeying God is even an act of worship and reverence to God.  It shows God, and proves to ourselves that we truly love him.  God wants us to always know that he loves us, he is our father, and anything he ask of us is for our benefit.  God not only instructs us, but he helps us, we don&#39;t have to do it alone, and apart frm God we won&#39;t beable to obey him, and be the person he has designed us to be." />
