  <title>God’S Best for Me and You! - Jane Frances Andersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you suffering from difficult people? Is your self-esteem low? Read Gods Best for Me and You and learn how the author came out of her dilemma. With God (Jesus) to lead her through it and with the help of angelic people (who have been through it too), she became well and is now able to write this book for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane Frances Andersen experienced abuse (not with parents) from people she was powerless to stop. And she had sick dependencies, which they think they did some good, but it was evil for her too. And she learned to be independent of their goodwill before having to cope with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She went to twelve-step groups, which helped a lot for there were many people who suffered similar things. The ones that helped others helped her there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was codependent, which she never knew a term existed before, and she became a compulsive overeater. Not being just a glutton, but she ate to ease her tensions and feelings of low self-esteem and despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a kind, understanding, and knowledgeable doctor was chosen by her, and he helped her tremendously. He taught a healthful way of life. And he probably just taught her to stay away from such sick people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now shes healthy and strong and knows better, for she had to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She resides in St. Louis, Missouri, and is a wife, a mother of a grown son, and a homemaker. She enjoys reading, baking, cooking, and of course, writing. She writes many letters to people every day to keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is a born-again Christian and a member of a Lutheran ChurchMissouri Synod.&lt;/p&gt;" />
