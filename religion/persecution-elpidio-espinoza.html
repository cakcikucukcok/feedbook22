  <title>Persecution - Elpidio Espinoza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its been a while that this book was planted in the authors heart due to the compassion and the great love he has seen in the Bible that God has for His persecuted children. 
From the Garden of Eden the devil has been dedicated to persecute the children of God. He uses all kinds of deceitfulness, lies and all kinds of possible traps to destroy the redeemed. Persecution is real today just like it always has been for the believers. 
The Bible says in 2nd Tim 3:12, Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 
The Lord said that we will have afflictions in this world, non the less when we look around us it does not seem like there is persecution for many. Let me assure you that all of the redeemed are being persecuted one way or another this very moment. 
The devil is using all kinds of ways, he knows them all and works 24/7/365 and its like a shodow that is always behind the believers. Alot of christians without knowing have fallen in the tramp of the devil. Its sad to see defeat in so many people that should live in continual victory over whats wrong, and the flesh because of what the Lord did for us on the Cross of Calvery. 
His main purpose is that everyone who reads this book will be blessed and have a positive reaction. 
No matter where you are in any part of the world, even if you are in prison because of your faith in Jesus Christ. 
Today there are children of God in prison, and their only crime is to believe in their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with all their heart." />
