  <title>When Parenting Isn&#39;t Perfect - Jim Daly, Paul Asay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Perfection is the enemy of parenting. Jim Daly sees and hears from mothers and fathers trying hard to pursue perfection. They listen to the best experts and read all the right books. When someone gives them a &amp;ldquo;World&amp;rsquo;s Best Mom&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;No. 1 Dad&amp;rdquo; coffee mug, they want it to be true. And they want their children to pursue perfection, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s admirable for parents to be the very best moms and dads they can be for their children. But sometimes in so doing, they leave grace behind &amp;ndash; both for themselves and their children. Jim believes that our quest for perfection, a quest that he believes is particularly strong among Christians, runs counter to God&amp;rsquo;s own boundless gift of grace. We can become Pharisaical parents, quoting endless rules and holding everyone to impossible standards. But God doesn&amp;rsquo;t want us, and our kids don&amp;rsquo;t need us, to be perfect. As parents, we&amp;rsquo;re called to simply do our best. And when we fail &amp;ndash; which we will &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re called to try again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he&amp;rsquo;s the President of Focus on the Family, Jim does not promise that his book will be a catalyst for a perfect family. But it can help point the way toward a good family &amp;ndash; one that feels safe and warm; one filled with love and laughter. This book will encourage mothers and fathers to embrace the messiness of parenthood and show grace to their own less-than-ideal children. Jim, through his own experiences, expertise, and array of stories, will lead both moms and dads to a better understanding of what being a good family is all about.&lt;/p&gt;" />
