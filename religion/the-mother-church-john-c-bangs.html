  <title>The Mother Church - John C. Bangs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It would be reasonable to estimate that multiple hundreds of thousands of people have become followers of Jesus Christ as a result of the modern church-planting movement. One characteristic of the literature of this movement has been an almost singular focus on the individual who is sent out to lead the new congregation, rather than on the vital role of the sending or sponsoring church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically all the books are written with one target in mind: this individual leader, the pioneer pastor, usually referred to as the church planter. The Mother Church is not written for pioneer pastors; it is written for the leaders of potential mother churches. It is designed to help leaders assess whether and when the birthing of a new church is a good idea for their congregation and to provide them with tools to birth and nurture healthy, thriving, life-giving new churches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church leaders who desire to see their mission efforts survive and thrive need to give special attention to the hard-won insights of John Bangs The Mother Church. Bangs is not only a mission planter and pastor, but he brings the broader view of a church-planting leader ... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mother Church will revolutionize the way we view and do birthing of mission churches. &lt;/p&gt;
