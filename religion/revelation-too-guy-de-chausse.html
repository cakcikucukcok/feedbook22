      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Worldly power and riches have corrupted humanity, but some heroes continue to fight for the Lord and the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a journey through time, including a foray to thirteenth-century Prague and a quest for power through a manmade creature called the golem. Enter an age when societies of knights of the Crusades brought back secrets from the Holy Land, along with a system of banking and corporate organization that brought them vast richesas well as the enmity of the Church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern times, powerful societies continue to operate and flourish in underground places. Theyve become bolder, and they want to dominate the world, but the power behind the thrones is becoming restless and will soon show his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rulers of the earthly realm begin to see that the power they thought they controlled really controls them. They discover it might be too late to become enlightened in Revelation Too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
