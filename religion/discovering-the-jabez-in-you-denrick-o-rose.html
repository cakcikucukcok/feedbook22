  <title>Discovering the Jabez in You - Denrick O. Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Devoted, spiritual, prayer man of God, Denrick Rose has written a powerful motivational book on the prayer of Jabez. This book is definitely on the top of the must read list. The writer focuses his attention not only on the prayer of Jabez, but he also turns his attention to the many different aspects of the life of Jabez and how the struggles that he must have encountered could be used as instruments; showing others how they too could rise above obstacles and become more successful in life.
Denrick&#39;s new book, Discovering the Jabez in You, demonstrates to the readers that even though a person may find his or herself in a very sorrowful and unproductive lifestyle, there is still no reason to lose hope. The choices you make today will yield its results tomorrow.  
Denrick also tries to express to his readers that the first step towards attaining a life-changing event is to first discover that there is a need for change. Praying to the God of Israel would be the next step, just as Jabez did in his time of need, then stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. 
The book also features many different personal prayers, which are solely intended to aid the readers to develop a closer relationship with God." />
