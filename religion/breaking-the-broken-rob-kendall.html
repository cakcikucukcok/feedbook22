  <title>Breaking the Broken - Rob Kendall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a country, we spend billions on Social Justice Programs, but what are the results? Life is not getting better for those in poverty. The numbers continue to rise; leaving millions of hearts, families and communities enslaved to a degrading system. In the war on poverty, poverty has won. The benefits of social justice are a myth. The experiment has failed, but God has a plan. God’s Plan offers dignity, restoration and hope. He established His Plan in the Garden of Eden and used it throughout Scripture to restore, “The least of these.” God does not call us to Social Justice, He calls us to love and heal the broken. Whether you’re in full-time, part-time or volunteer in ministry this book is for you. You will learn about God’s Plan, find examples of it in action, see the hope that it brings, and gain insight on how to implement God’s Plan in your own communities. This book will better equip you to represent Christ to the lost and heal the broken." />
