  <title>Breaking out of the Cloud - Emmanuel J. Gomashie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;/p&gt;You must read this book! It reveals keys to overcoming cloudy situations in life. When the mind is clouded, it seems like all hell as broken loose. You cant focus; you cant seem to understand what is really going on with you, your marriage, your business, your children, and some other areas of concern. It is an enemy at work; it is a life under attack and must be dealt with swiftly to break out into a clear sky of visibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jesus said, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The world and all that goes on within it will drive you nuts without Jesus. This book is written to take you through dissolving every cloud in your life to helping you gain visibility for your highway to blessing. &lt;/p&gt;" />
