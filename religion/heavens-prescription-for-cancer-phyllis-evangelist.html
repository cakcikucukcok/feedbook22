  <title>Heavens Prescription for Cancer - Phyllis Evangelist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cancer, the word nobody wants to hear. No doctor or anybody enjoys breaking that news to even those you dont like. It carries so much poison that if you are not careful the very first day, you are told that you have it, you can quickly deteriorate in an instant, or take you out as soon as possible if you dont have faith.
But beloved, it should not be so. Cancer is a word, but remember, we also have a word that is powerful than cancer, which is the word of God. In Isaiah, it says the flowers fall and the glass withers, but the word of God stands forever. We should not be afraid of cancer or any of the terminal diseases. Why? Because we have the best physician whose name is Jesus. See, we have good news in John 10:10, The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. Also in Luke, Jesus replied, What is impossible with men is possible with God (Luke 18:27). Our God is in the business of showing us and our enemies who is the boss, and he says, I will restore you to health and heal your wounds, declares the Lord, because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares (Jeremiah 30:17)." />
