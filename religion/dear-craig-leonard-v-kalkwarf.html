  <title>Dear Craig - Leonard V. Kalkwarf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I invite you to listen in as a grandfather shares his faith and values through a series of fifteen letters with his grandson. The tone is intimate and encouraging as it bridges the generational gap through gentle care and timeless truth. Kalkwarf inspires both grandparents and grandchildren to see and live a more rooted, relevant life.&lt;/br&gt;
The Rev. Gregg A. Mast, PhD, &lt;i&gt;president, New Brunswick Theological Seminary, New Brunswick, New Jersey &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating glimpse into the thoughts of people confronted by the crucifixion, full of suspense, drama and enduring truths.&lt;/br&gt;
Virginia Castor &lt;i&gt;elder, Abington Presbyterian Church, Abington, Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dear Craig, Len Kalkwarf has penned a beautiful way for one generation to communicate contemporary biblical understandings to succeeding generations.  The Christian faith of a grandfather is shared with his grandson in such a way that all of us can gain insights for our communications with our children and grandchildren.&lt;/br&gt;
The Rev. James M. Bell,&lt;i&gt; pastor, The Village Church, Greenspring Retirement Community, Springfield, Virginia  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Craig is an inspiring book of letters written by a mentor about first-century individuals who provide fresh insights especially for clergy and educators.&lt;/br&gt;
Dr. Edwin G. Mulder, &lt;i&gt;general secretary emeritus, Reformed Church in America&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young men and womenand, indeed, all who want to find what the Bible is about will find Dr. Kalkwarfs treatment of its larger persons engagingly helpful. He makes them come alive! Their letters are instructive, fun, and good reading!&lt;/br&gt;
Rear Admiral Ross H. Trower &lt;i&gt;former chief of navy chaplains&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a thoughtful and fascinating collection of first-person narratives. These are not one-dimensional saints or sinners but complex characters. Kalkwarf has brought them to life and told their stories in a way that allows them to speak meaningfully to twenty-first-century readers.&lt;/br&gt;
Dr. Lynn Japinga, &lt;i&gt;professor of religion, Hope College, Holland, Michigan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
