  <title>The Broken Hearted - Debbie Melson, Stacy Jordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Deborah has written these pages in an effort to encourage readers that are walking in crisis. This book also reveals that life can suddenly change when we are challenged with forces beyond our control. Those forces could be illness, grief, or a broken heart. Prioritizing our position with God and believing our eternity is secure surpasses anything life can force on us. It makes you understand that as a Christian, you will face the same trials and obstacles as a nonbeliever and helps you also to understand that if you are a nonbeliever, that too can be changed. The difference being the peace you gain by grasping Gods hand as you walk through difficulty. Believing God and accepting his will even when we dont like the direction he is allowing us to go, much less the outcome it looks like we are facing, takes courage that only comes from him. While you join her in this journey of heart disease, maybe you will find some scripture to latch onto and possibly a word or two of wisdom that can become light in your darkness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborahs hope is that you wont live like youre dying but that you will learn to live as though you will live forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
