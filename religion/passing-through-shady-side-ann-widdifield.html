  <title>Passing Through Shady Side - Ann Widdifield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A fascinating, sensitive, and well-researched book that enhances our 
understanding of the history of Shady Side, the history of Maryland, and 
the history of America. Its a story thats entertaining, educational, and 
important. 
--Kenneth T. Walsh, journalist and author of Family of Freedom: 
Presidents and African Americans in the White House 
A must-read, interesting book. Full of mores of yesterday and today. 
-- Mohan Grover, unoffi cial Shady Side mayor; owner of 
Rennos Market 
When Ms. Widdifield first approached me about her book-writing 
project, I was skeptical. After all, what could a spit of a woman with 
dainty eyes and light blond hair who spends her winters in sunny Florida 
possibly know about the lives of African Americans? Yet she approached 
this project with a passion and confidence that I have not seen in many 
seasoned historians. The results of her efforts say it all. Widdifield has 
brought the lives and stories of this waterside community alive and, in the 
process, has filled avoid in the history books of southern Maryland. 
-- Judith A. Cabral, Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Foundation 
Passing Through Shady Side is a rich, vivid account of a largely untold 
story: the history of African American families that have farmed and 
worked the waters surrounding the Shady Side peninsula for nearly two 
centuries. Ann Widdifield has brought to life the generations that have 
given Shady Side its special character, traditions and vitality.
