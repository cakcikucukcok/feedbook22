  <title>Cultural Apologetics - Paul M. Gould, J. P. Moreland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The post-Christian world we inhabit today presents us with a mundane and disenchanted view of reality. Under the sway of materialism and science, we have been left with a way of seeing, thinking, and living that has no place for beauty and wonder. We now live in a world bereft of magic and mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;including many Christians&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;no longer perceive the world in its proper light. As a result, the Christian imagination is muted. Moreover, the church has grown anti-intellectual and sensate, out of touch with the relevancy of Jesus and how to relate the gospel to all aspects of contemporary life. As a result, the Christian voice is muted. In this age Christian wholeness remains elusive, blunting the church&#39;s ability to present a winsome and compelling witness for faith. As a result, the Christian conscience is muted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cultural Apologetics&lt;/em&gt; addresses this malaise by setting forth a fresh model for cultural engagement, rooted in the biblical account of Paul&#39;s speech on Mars Hill, which details practical steps for reestablishing the Christian voice, conscience, and imagination. Readers will be equipped to see, and help others see, the world as it is&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;deeply beautiful, mysterious, and sacred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With creative insights, &lt;em&gt;Cultural Apologetics&lt;/em&gt; prepares readers to share a vision of the Christian faith that is both plausible and desirable, offering clarity for those who have become disoriented in the haze of modern Western culture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
