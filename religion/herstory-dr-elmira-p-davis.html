  <title>Herstory - Dr. Elmira P. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; This best selling book is a powerful reminder that if you don&#39;t learn from history you will be destined to repeat it. The author, Pastor Elmira P. Davis, shares her life story of challenge and survival while revisiting the biblical stories of ten women with their own poignant stories of desperation, deliverance, perseverance and triumph. Davis has rewound the tape of time and allowed you a rare opportunity to learn many valuable lessons from these historic women. After you push &#39;play&#39; and begin to read about each woman, remember to press &#39;pause&#39; as you read and ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you the message that you personally need to hear from &lt;b&gt;HER&lt;/b&gt;story. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You should be able to use the lessons in this book to delete, edit or rewrite the painful pages from your past as you allow God to dictate brand new chapters in your life. Remember, he already knows the wonderful ending that he has planned for you. Regardless of the story lines, chapters, ripped pages or red marks that you&#39;ve already experienced, it&#39;s not over until God says it is over. It may be the end of a chapter but it doesn&#39;t have to be the end of the book!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Get ready for your personal tour guide, led by the Holy Spirit, to your own mountaintop of fulfillment and purpose. Sit back, relax and get ready to revisit these biblical women from Genesis to Revelation, some well known, others less prominent, but all with a &lt;b&gt;HER&lt;/b&gt;story.
