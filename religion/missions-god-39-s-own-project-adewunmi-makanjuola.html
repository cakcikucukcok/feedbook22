  <title>Missions: God&#39;s Own Project - Adewunmi Makanjuola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Engaging in missions has been in the outlook of God right from the beginning. A careful study of the Bible reveals that His ultimate agenda was the sending of Jesus as a blessing to all the families of the world.
Why? Sin had crept into the otherwise innocent and worship life of man, with its resultant negative upshots.
God found in Abraham the sort of man through whose lineage He could Send Jesus, His blessed blessing into this sin-infested world for reformation. So, God sent Abraham to go and reprocreate a world of obedient and fruitful humanity that would carry and appropriate God&#39;s blessings. This resulted in the birth of Jesus. 
Jesus in turn founded the workshop of missions and missionaries  the Church. 
This book clearly points to the all-time truth that engaging in missions and missionary activities is crucial, urgent and imperative for all Christians, especially in these last days. God has therefore always remained committed to it. 
This book will open your eyes to the business of wealthiness." />
