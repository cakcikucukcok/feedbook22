  <title>Satsang with the Abbot - Abbot George Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;An informative, entertaining, and a practical guide for spiritual life.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The scriptures contain a mixture of sand and sugar, as it were. It is extremely difficult to separate the sugar from the sand.

Grounded in the perspective of classic Indian thought, directly taught by such luminaries as Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh and Sri Anandamayi Ma, and blessed with the clarity and originality of thought that can only come from years of spiritual practice (sadhana), his answers to his inquirers&amp;rsquo; questions are unique, fresh, and authoritative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions in this book range from the most sublime to the most practical. &amp;ldquo;How can I attain samadhi?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I am married with children. How can I lead a spiritual life?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What is Self-realization?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;How important is belief in karma and reincarnation?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Abbot George&amp;rsquo;s replies to these questions the reader will discover common sense, helpful information, and a guiding light for their journey through and beyond the forest of cliches, contradictions, and confusion of yoga, Hinduism, Christianity, and metaphysical thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(One of the most valuable spiritual activities in East or West is satsang: a gathering of spiritual aspirants for spiritual study, discussion and inspiration. A satsang is especially beneficial when there is someone with many years of practice and experience who answers the questions asked by the aspirants.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbot George Burke (Swami Nirmalananda Giri) is the founder and director of Light of the Spirit Monastery (Atma Jyoti Ashram) in Cedar Crest, New Mexico. In his many pilgrimages to India he had the opportunity to meet some of India&amp;rsquo;s greatest saints and yogis, and in the United States he also encountered various Christian saints. He is the author of numerous books on practical spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
