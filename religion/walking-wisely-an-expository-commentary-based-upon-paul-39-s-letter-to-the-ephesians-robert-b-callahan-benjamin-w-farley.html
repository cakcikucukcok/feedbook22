  <title>Walking Wisely: An Expository Commentary Based Upon Paul&#39;s Letter to the Ephesians - Robert B. Callahan, Benjamin W. Farley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Apostle Paul leaves no stone, teaching, or truth untouched as he continues developing a pathway for each of us built upon the foundation of the Triune God. He has carefully and prayer-fully utilized the words in this magnificent letter to clearly, concisely, and forcefully relate the truths revealed to him by the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Paul, in this illuminating sixth chapter of Ephesians, weaves together enlightening commands and counsel that will enhance the lives of people Walking With Jesus. He tells the believers what to do and what not to do in simple, straightforward language. He succinctly describes Christlike conduct, before expounding upon the lifestyles of those who will have no inheritance in the Kingdom of God and Christ. These tough words make one stop and think. At least, they should. The Apostle continues Walking With Jesus by urging Christ&#39;s followers to walk wisely and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise. After building this part of God&#39;s pathway, Paul focuses our attention on the two most important relationships in one&#39;s life: (i) marriage; and (ii) Christ and His church. The truths presented by the Apostle provide Christ&#39;s companions, as the walk together, with an increasing faith plus joy, knowledge, love, strength, and wisdom. May we ask for nothing more, nothing less, and nothing else." />
