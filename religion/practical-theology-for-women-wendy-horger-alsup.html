  <title>Practical Theology for Women - Wendy Horger Alsup</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to understand the deep things of the Word but been put off by the intimidating vocabulary of theologians? Have you assumed that studying the attributes of God is for seminary students only? Or maybe &quot;just for men&quot;? Have heavy doctrinal themes felt beyond you and your everyday world? If so-if you&#39;ve ever thought theology was too deep, too impractical, or too irrelevant for your life as a woman-this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As author Wendy Alsup explores fundamental theological issues you&#39;ve always wondered about-minus the daunting vocabulary and complex sentence structure of academic tomes-she brings them into real life&amp;hellip; into your world&amp;hellip; and reveals the heart of true theology. It&#39;s really about &quot;simple yet incredibly profound stuff that affects our daily lives,&quot; she says. Stuff like faith and gaining a right knowledge of God as the foundation for wise daily living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alsup writes: &quot;Truly, there is nothing like a good grasp of accurate knowledge about God to enable you to meet the practical demands of your life-the practical demands of being a daughter, mother, wife, sister, or friend.&quot; Let &lt;em&gt;Practical Theology for Women&lt;/em&gt; show you the everyday difference that knowing God makes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
