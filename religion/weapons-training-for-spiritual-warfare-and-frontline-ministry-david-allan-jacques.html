  <title>Weapons Training for Spiritual Warfare and Frontline Ministry - David Allan Jacques</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;WARNING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont read Weapons Training for Spiritual Warfare and Frontline Ministry if you want to maintain the status quo! It may turn your world upside down by challenging the way you have always seen things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Warfare is a very vague and nebulous term in many circles of Christendom. Many believers talk about it but dont really know what it is or how to successfully engage in it. Some are even afraid of, or at the least, uncomfortable with the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My purpose for Weapons Training for Spiritual Warfare and Frontline Ministry is to arm Christians with a working knowledge of how to engage our enemy in battle successfully, taking ground away from the demonic and bringing light into places previously occupied by darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants more than anything to see His church (His bride) walk in purity and victory, so I give the believer in Christ a working knowledge of the various spiritual weapons made available to them. I will teach you how to effectively employ these weapons. I will train you for war, so that you might gain the victory in your walk with God; win the lost out of darkness, and effectively destroy the works of the devil!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, you will begin to truly experience kingdom reality and dominion over the demonic. Moreover, you will start to be the change agent in your sphere of influence, as God uses you to advance His kingdom. This will bring a breakthrough in your life and in the lives of others, as you learn Weapons Training for Spiritual Warfare and Frontline Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
