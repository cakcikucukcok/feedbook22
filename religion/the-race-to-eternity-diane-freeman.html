  <title>The Race to Eternity - Diane Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Race to Eternityis it real? I have the proof, and it is within the pages of this book as real-life encounters with those who have died only to become trapped in perpetuity as it were and share their stories of what they saw, what they felt, and what pulled them out of darkness. The Race to Eternity will uncover the truth behind what happens at death and what occurs to the soul of the individual whose life is entangled with the energies of emotion of this world. The Race to Eternity will detail for your personal experiences of the author, Diane Freeman, as she was guided to assist certain individuals, many famous, in their transition from life to eternity, but who had been waylaid by their experiences of life. They had become entangled in the energies of the planet and were unable to move forward as is intended for all people of the planet, having the experience of life in a body. Let Diane Freeman bring understanding to all of you who wish to understand the meaning of life in the body and what happens to the soul at death, for no man knows the hour of his death and death happens to us all, in the body that is, for the soul lives eternally. Let The Race to Eternity assure that your soul has the understanding that it needs to move on when the time comes." />
