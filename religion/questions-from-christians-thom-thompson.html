  <title>Questions from Christians - Thom Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Questions from Christians, a conversation between a Christian and a Bahai, Christians find answers to questions about the Bahai Faith, and Bahaullah and His Teachings.  In addition to learning why Bahais accept Bahaullah as the Return of the Spirit of Christ, Christians can learn what Bahaullah taught about God, Jesus Christ, the Virgin Birth, the Bible, Life after Death, Sin, Forgiveness and the Time of the End.  Christians are introduced to Bahaullah as The Father of all Mankind, Who has come to lead all men and women of the earth into an ingathering and unification of the human race.&lt;P&gt;
	This is wonderful materialnot only will it bring countless Christians to the point of accepting Bahaullah, but it also will, I am convinced, help countless Bahais to develop a new reverence for Christ, and a heightened sense of connectedness to their Christian brothers and sisters. &lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/XL_assets/images/DOT_CLEAR.GIF&quot; width=40 height=1&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/XL_assets/images/DOT_CLEAR.GIF&quot; width=40 height=1&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/XL_assets/images/DOT_CLEAR.GIF&quot; width=40 height=1&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/XL_assets/images/DOT_CLEAR.GIF&quot; width=40 height=1&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/XL_assets/images/DOT_CLEAR.GIF&quot; width=40 height=1&gt;Gary Matthews, author of He Cometh with Clouds.
