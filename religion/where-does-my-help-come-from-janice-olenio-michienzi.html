  <title>Where Does My Help Come From? - Janice Olenio-Michienzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These writings come from my heart and from the Word of God. I have experienced many deep disappointments and hurts in my life that have affected my heart and soul to the point of what I thought was irreparable damage, only to learn that God can heal all wounds. It isnt time that will heal; its only a strong and close relationship with God, and trust and faith from you. The scriptures that I have chosen are only just a glimpse of what you will find in the Word of God, and as you begin to follow your own path toward healing and develop your own personal relationship with the Creator of the universe, you will be amazed by what he has to say.&lt;/p&gt;" />
