  <title>Great Is His Faithfulness - Tammera S. Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I started a project to assemble a collection of my poetry, but as I began to assemble this collection I realized that there was more to tell.  Because I am a spirit-filled Christian my love for God is reflected in most of my works. Some of my works come from my fantasies and illusions of how life and love should be, and some come from the people that I have been privileged to know and call my friends.  My poetry is a gift from God, given to me through the people, places and circumstances that make up my life.  God puts the inspiration in my life and puts the words in my heart, I just put it down on paper.    
So I decided to include stories about some of the poems and what inspired them. As I started adding these stories, it was clear that I was sharing the testimony of how God has worked in me and through me. I wanted to provide the reader with scriptures that support my testimony. So I added Bible study topics with room provided for taking notes. 
A note about the Study Topics included in the book:  As a new Christian I was always hungry to learn more about God, about His word and His will for my life. I found that a study edition bible was an invaluable resource for me to learn more and grow in my faith and in my understanding.  The study Bible that I have includes almost 300 different thematic articles for study.  I chose only a few topics that I believed to be relevant for inclusion in this book.  I referenced my study Bible for information, for chapters/verses to reference, and for quotes, but the study topics included here are written to express my understanding of the Bibles teaching, to express my opinion and my beliefs.  
Since I am not a theologian or educated in the seminary, I did ask my own Pastor to review these study topics for accuracy and completeness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For any of my readers who dont already have that personal relationship with God, these bible study topics are a starting point for learning more about His awesome love for us all.  Just as they have been a starting point for me in my infancy as a Christian. This is by no means all there is to know or learn, as Christians we should always be hungry to learn more about Gods word and His will for us. Because none of us can ever know everything there is to know about God, we should continually seek knowledge of His will for us. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is my sincere hope that this collection of works will move and inspire. But most of all, I pray that it will bring others to salvation in Christ." />
