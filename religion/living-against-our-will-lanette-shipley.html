  <title>Living Against Our Will - LaNette Shipley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each one of us holds tremendous personal and spiritual worth. Yet so many people have never been cherished to the depth of their greatest potential. Within every soul lies a dying ember in search of the light of our existence. We are born and live in the garden of good and evil, separated by our Creator, fighting unseen battles that are impossible to conquer based on our own natural ability. Many of us turn to destructive methods to feed our hungry, searching soul. We strive for encouragement and acceptance, yet sometimes we are met with pain, rejection, discouragement, and injury. 
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God
(Romans 12:2 NKJV)
Written within these pages is the testimony of a determined young woman who refused to accept the harsh reality dealt to her. Through tenacity as a mother, she finally discovered the supernatural transforming power of being reunited with her Creator, and her soul was ignited by the Savior of her destiny. LaNette embraced the wisdom and knowledge held within God-breathed Scripture and internalized the absolute truth. She clearly reveals the generational strongholds and family behavioral patterns that can destroy us, relationships, and squelch our God-given purpose, gifts, and talents." />
