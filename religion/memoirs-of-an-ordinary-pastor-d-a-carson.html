  <title>Memoirs of an Ordinary Pastor - D. A. Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;D. A. Carson&#39;s father was a pioneering church-planter and pastor in Quebec. But still, an ordinary pastor-except that he ministered during the decades that brought French Canada from the brutal challenges of persecution and imprisonment for Baptist ministers to spectacular growth and revival in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a story, and an era, that few in the English-speaking world know anything about. But through Tom Carson&#39;s journals and written prayers, and the narrative and historical background supplied by his son, readers will be given a firsthand account of not only this trying time in North American church history, but of one pastor&#39;s life and times, dreams and disappointments. With words that will ring true for every person who has devoted themselves to the Lord&#39;s work, this unique book serves to remind readers that though the sacrifices of serving God are great, the sweetness of living a faithful, obedient life is greater still.&lt;/p&gt;" />
