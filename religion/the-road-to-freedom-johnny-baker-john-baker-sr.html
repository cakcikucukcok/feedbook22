  <title>The Road to Freedom - Johnny Baker, John Baker Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Road to Freedom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the path of hope for all of us who are stuck. With practical application and inspiration, Johnny Baker shares his story of recovering from alcoholism and offers the truths he has learned from his 25 years with Celebrate Recovery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker&amp;rsquo;s father, John, founded Celebrate Recovery when Baker was 15 years old. Later, Baker became involved with alcohol himself. Even though he saw his parents&amp;rsquo; marriage heal and watched his dad become a new person, he had to experience his own journey of healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker began the process of recovery as a young adult. Now he serves on the leadership team of Celebrate Recovery, sharing his testimony of how God brought him back home. In the years since leaving alcohol behind, Baker has witnessed thousands of other lives change through the power of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are dealing with substance abuse, relational struggles, or eating challenges, or you simply want to let go of what is holding you back in life, you will find answers in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Road to Freedom&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;In addition to telling his own story, Baker offers ten principles of healing. These life lessons remind you that pain has a purpose, small and steady improvement lasts longer than overnight change, serving others leads to deeper healing, and facing your problems is the only way to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Road to Freedom&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will help you move from coping with hurts, hang-ups, and habits to the hope and health that only Jesus can bring.&lt;/p&gt;" />
