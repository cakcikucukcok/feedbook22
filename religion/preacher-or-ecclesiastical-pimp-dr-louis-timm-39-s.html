  <title>Preacher, or Ecclesiastical Pimp! - Dr. Louis Timm&#39;s</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are a minister, have a minister, know a minister or know someone else that has or knows a minister, this book is an absolute must read. Money and sex are two of the biggest culprits of our time and being in the church is no guarantee to immunity. The real names have been changed to protect the guilty and should the likeness of any character in this book appear to resemble any individual, it is purely intentional. True to form, I have deliberately resorted to the act of embellishment on certain factual like accounts in this book, purely for effect of it all. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Dr. Timm&#39;s has written this book to let the children of God everywhere know that you are not alone and that the goings on at your local church is not an isolated incidence. Every church needs to have a Pastor/Minister, but know this, God has an all Seeing Eye and He has not forgotten about your plight. I dare you to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, let Him fix it, wait on God, He will show up and He will definitely show out. Not only will we have to pay for our wrongdoings, but they that have pleasure in them will have a price to pay as well; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;CTR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Thus saith the Lord&quot;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From the same author that brought us; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Little Miss Sanctified&quot; &lt;/P&gt;
