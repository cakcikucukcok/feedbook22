  <title>Facing Doubt: A Book for Adventist Believers &#39;On the Margins&#39; - Reinder Bruinsma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the surface it may appear that I am quite negative about many things in my church and that I am pessimistic about the church&amp;rsquo;s future. That would, however, be a wrong conclusion. I am not about to give up on my church but I try to take the long view. I believe current clouds can blow away and eventually new winds can begin to blow. The last thing I would want to do is discourage any readers by my analysis of the crisis in Christianity in general, and in Adventism in particular. I would be devastated if my book drove people away from faith and away from their church. On the contrary, I hope with all my heart that it will help at least some readers to take a new &amp;lsquo;leap of faith&amp;rsquo; and then (re)-connect with their church.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have written this book because I deeply care for all those who have ended up &amp;lsquo;on the margins.&amp;rsquo; I do not have the illusion that reading it will make all doubts disappear. I do hope and pray, however, that it will help those who read it to establish priorities in their faith experience and in their ties with the church, and dare to live creatively with their uncertainties and doubts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
