  <title>Hasidism - Marcin Wodziński, David Biale, David Assaf, Benjamin Brown...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first comprehensive history of the pietistic movement that shaped modern Judaism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first comprehensive history of the pietistic movement that shaped modern Judaism. The book&amp;#8217;s unique blend of intellectual, religious, and social history offers perspectives on the movement&amp;#8217;s leaders as well as its followers, and demonstrates that, far from being a throwback to the Middle Ages, Hasidism is a product of modernity that forged its identity as a radical alternative to the secular world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasidism originated in southeastern Poland, in mystical circles centered on the figure of Israel Ba&#39;al Shem Tov, but it was only after his death in 1760 that a movement began to spread. Challenging the notion that Hasidism ceased to be a creative movement after the eighteenth century, this book argues that its first golden age was in the nineteenth century, when it conquered new territory, won a mass following, and became a mainstay of Jewish Orthodoxy. World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the Holocaust decimated eastern European Hasidism. But following World War II, the movement enjoyed a second golden age, growing exponentially. Today, it is witnessing a remarkable renaissance in Israel, the United States, and other countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by an international team of scholars, &lt;i&gt;Hasidism&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand this vibrant and influential modern Jewish movement.&lt;/p&gt;" />
