  <title>Hearing the Call - Gordon Mursell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The difference between going into the ministry at the age of 20 or 30, rather than 40 or 50, might simply be that someone asked sooner rather than later, &amp;amp;#145;Have you thought of being ordained?&amp;amp;#8217; Especially when we are young, it is easy to feel that we might be inadequate for the job, but the Bible is encouragingly littered with stories of individuals who didn&amp;amp;#8217;t feel up to what God called them to be! Hearing the Call stresses that our very humanness, our sense of inadequacy, can be a gift in ministry and allow God&amp;amp;#8217;s grace to flow. Gordon Mursell&amp;amp;#8217;s wise reflections on several relevant biblical passages wonderfully complement Jonathan Lawson&amp;amp;#8217;s vivid recounting of his wide experience of young vocations. He illustrates this with real-life stories from young people he has counselled and encouraged.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
