  <title>The Assassin and Mordecai - Lloyd A. Atabansi Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The battle is real. You are involved in a spiritual battle with the powers of darkness, whether you choose to believe it or not or whether you like it or not. The Bible tells us that Satan is constantly scheming to defeat Christians. This formidable foe, Satan, has a ministry to steal, kill, and destroy the Christian and Gods kingdom agendas. Whether we chose to accept this reality or not is our prerogative. We are living in a combat zone against Satans highly organized kingdom of darkness. There are human agents that are empowered by the kingdom of darkness to identify, prey, and cause great harm on unsuspecting Christians. You need not be afraid of the powers of darkness. You can rest, assured that our victory is already won in Jesus Christ. This story is about Mordecai Adams, who, as a child, was initiated and dedicated into Satanism. He spends his childhood days in an abnormal environment until his eighteenth birthday, when the powers of darkness began their reign of terror in his life, thus seeking to destroy him. Mordecai soon finds out that he was initiated and dedicated into occultism by a very close relative who sought power, wealth, and fame from a juju witch doctor, a man called Founder, a servant and priest of Chynzaimon, a manifestation of an evil personality. As Mordecai grew, he recognized that things are not going well for him. He is not able to establish and sustain meaningful relationships or hold down a job. His finances, mind, health, and personal properties are constantly under attack from this invisible enemy. After a series of spiritual battles, Mordecai soon realizes the source of his attacks and misfortunes. He embarks on a spiritual journey to defeat this invisible enemy, who continues to lurk and hide in mystery until his exposure. Upon knowing the identity of his enemy, Mordecai then recognizes his power and authority in Christ and soon thereafter defeats the enemy and obtains total and complete victory. As you read this book, it will help you aggressively and systematically claim your triumph by relying on the Almighty God and in the power of his word." />
