  <title>Kiss &amp; Tell - Joy Inyamu Akut</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. Matthew 10:27 (NIV) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kiss that soothes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kiss that cleanses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kiss that heals and forgives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kiss of grace and favor so beautiful, you have no choice but to tell! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, the lover of our souls expresses His love for us daily with the kisses of His grace and mercy. There is a kiss available for everything you go through and so much more When the wind howls, and the clouds grow dark. When you feel lost, and you struggle through storms. When you feel youve fallen too far off from God and you cower and hide in your sin, there is a kiss of forgiveness for you. We have the kisses of God available for everything we go through, every mess we find ourselves in, every trial that comes our way and every moment we celebrate in joy God loves us that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author uses everyday experiences to encourage us as we wade through life. Kiss and tell is a book filled with kisses from God in form of words of inspiration, to trust even when the chips are down, to hope even when you feel forlorn, and to call on God and run into His waiting arms of love no matter how much you feel youve failed Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
