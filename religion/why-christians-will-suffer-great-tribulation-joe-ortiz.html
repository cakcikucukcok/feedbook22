  <title>Why Christians Will Suffer &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; - Joe Ortiz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This sequel to The End Times Passover [Why Christians Will Suffer Great Tribulation] biblically proves why Gods true disciples will experience great tribulation, and will have to remain on earth awaiting the return of Jesus Christ.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most evangelical Christians believe in The Rapture, they just dont know if its going to be a Pre-Tribulation Rapture, or a Mid or Post Tribulation Rapture. Regardless, many evangelicals believe the Rapture is right around the corner. They believe that Armageddon is knocking at the door. The crisis and battles for territorial rights in the Middle East, the outbreak of Holy Wars and terrorism throughout the world, have most evangelicals convinced the end is near! But, they arent worried because their hopes lie in The Rapture; a unique event where they believe Jesus Christ will return to earth and snatch them secretly up to heaven while all hell breaks loose on earth! &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But, what would happen if there wasnt going to be a Rapture? What would happen if all of those stories they have been hearing and reading about not being Left Behind were nothing but sheer lies? Would that concern them? Are they prepared to experience great tribulation? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This sequel to The End Times Passover (Why Christians Will Suffer Great Tribulation) biblically proves why Gods true disciples will experience horrible persecution while awaiting the final return of Jesus Christ. However, many of these brave disciples will be found preaching the gospel as never before, regardless of the price! Millions of themmay even be slaughtered, but they will die for Christ the way He died for them! This may not sound like Good News; but its absolutely true! Check out the reasons why!&lt;/P&gt;" />
