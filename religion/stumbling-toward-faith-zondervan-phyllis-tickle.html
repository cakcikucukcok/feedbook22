  <title>Stumbling toward Faith - Zondervan, Phyllis Tickle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Author Renee Altson understands all about being hurt, feeling alone, and full of doubt. While her story is an extreme example of abuse and mistreatment done in the name of God, her struggles with God as Father and with faith and disbelief are universal. This book is a perfect companion for those who have survived or know someone who has survived abuse, as well as for anyone who has ever questioned whether the journey toward faith is worthwhile. As you stumble with Renee, you will discover new deep places within your own heart and the freedom to question a God who is big enough to handle your doubts. May this book help you learn the breath and depth of the love of God and may the prayer you offer be the same as Renee&#39;s: &quot;I believe. Help my unbelief.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;" />
