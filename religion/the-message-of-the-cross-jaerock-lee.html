  <title>The Message of the Cross - Jaerock Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This must-have book provides clear answers to questions often asked by Christians who are curious about things not directly addressed in the Bible. What was God the Creator like before the beginning of time? Why did God create man and let him live on this earth? Why did God place the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden? Why did God send His one and only Son as an atoning sacrifice? Why did God plan the providence of salvation through the rugged wooden cross? These questions and more are resolved by Dr. Jaerock Lee. The book consists of spirit-filled messages of hope and salvation for all who have questions about what God wants from the faithful. As preached by Dr. Lee, the knowledge provided in The Message of the Cross will enlighten you on the deep, wide, and great love God has for His creation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
