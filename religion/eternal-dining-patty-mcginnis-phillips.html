  <title>Eternal Dining - Patty McGinnis Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE BOOK ARRIVED FROM THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS I WENT THROUGH AND THE LOVE I HAVE FOR MY FAMILY. I LOVE THEM JUST AS MUCH AS THEY LOVE ME. I HATED ALL THE THINGS THEY DID FOR ME BECAUSE I COULDNT EVER REPAY ALL THE THINGS THEY HAVE DONE FOR ME. WHEN YOUR FAMILY BACK AWAY FROM YOU GOD WILL BE THERE TO STEP IN. THERE IS A REASON FOR ANY FAMILY MEMBERS LIVING YOU GOOD OR BAD. THIS WAS HARD FOR ME TO BEAR WHEN MY FAMILY WAS ALWAYS THERE. GOD DOES THINGS FOR A REASON.
I FOUND OUT LATER THAT THIS HAD TO HAPPEN SO I COULD DO WHAT HE WANTED ME TO DO. GOD TRAINED ME IN ALL AREAS OF MY LIFE. WRITING THIS BOOK GAVE ME MORE STRENGTH, POWER, AND RESTORATION. IT REVEALED A LOT OF THINGS IN MY LIFE THAT I DIDNT SEE BEFORE NOW. A LOT OF REVEALATION FROM GOD IS IN THIS BOOK. A LOT OF LOVE IS REVEALED TO ME FROM GOD. GOD TAUGHT ME AS I WROTE THIS BOOK. IF GOD DID NOT LOVE ME I WOULD HAVE NOT MADE IT THROUGH. 
THIS BOOK CAN HELP PEOPLE THAT IS JUST COMING TO CHRIST. I SPOKE FROM THE HEART WITH EXPERIENCE. IT CAN BE FOR LOST SOULS TO COME TO CHRIST. THIS BOOK CAN GIVE INSIGHT TO THE PEOPLE THAT DONT FULLY UNDERSTAND AND HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF GODS WORD, OR EVEN DONT BELIEVE IN HIM. GOD WANTS PEOPLE TO TURN FROM SIN AND WICKEDNESS. GOD HATE SIN AND EVIL. HE WANTS FAITHFULNESS AND RIGHTEOUNESS. GOD WANTS OUR BODY TO BE HIS TEMPLE.
THE BOOK IS ABOUT HURT AND PAIN, CHILDREN, BEING A MOTHER. ITS ABOUT GODLINESS, AND HOW WE SHOULD LIVE LIKE CHRIST. IT TELLS ABOUT HOW TO FIGHT THE DEVILS IN YOUR LIFE AND WHAT TO DO IN TRYING TIMES. I WANT THE READERS TO KNOW THAT THERE IS MORE WRATH COMING AND TO BE PREPARED. JESUS IS COMING BACK AGAIN.
THIS BOOK IS ABOUT GODS WORD, ABOUT PEOPLE IN GENERAL AND THE WAY THEY THINK OR DO.ITS ABOUT BEING A SINGLE PARENT AND SURVING IN LIFE WITH GODS HELP. ITS ABOUT HAVING FAITH, TRUSTING AND OBEYING GOD WORD. THE BOOK IS ABOUT HAVING A CONVENANT WITH GOD.
THIS BOOK TELLS ABOUT EVERYTHING WE NEED TO LINE UP WITH GODS WORD IN ORDER TO GET ON THE PATH OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. ITS ABOUT KEEP GOING WHEN OBSTACLES COME IN YOUR WAY. WE HAVE ALL THE HELP WE NEED IN GOD. ALWAYS KEEP A POSITIVE ATTITUDE. DONT LISTEN TO NEGATIVE TALKING." />
