  <title>Hanging on to Hope - Annette Newcomb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is an incredibly beautiful story of hope and healing. Annette is a remarkable woman who knows the depth of pain, yet with Gods help and perseverance she and her family were able to make it through a very tough time. I was absolutely inspired by reading this book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Jim Burns, PhD. President, HomeWord&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Author of Confident Parenting, Creating an Intimate Marriage&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A remarkable story told with courage, vulnerability, honesty, hope, and forgiveness. So proud of you and Adam, and the work you both have sought and found in and through the journey of Gods truth, grace, healing, and restoration. Well done, good and faithful servants. This is a powerful message! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Denny Bellesi, Pastor Emeritus Coast Hills Church&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Co-Author of The Kingdom Assignment with wife Leesa Bellesi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very honored to have actually witnessed the growth, healing and love that occurred between this godly couple. This true story will help others who are struggling with lifes challenges not to lose hope and recognize that there is no obstacle too big for God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enemy throws all he can at us to get us off course. Hanging On to Hope chronicles one persons journey through lifes trials and how God brought her through each one. This same God can bring you through whatever you are facing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
