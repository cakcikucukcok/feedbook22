  <title>Moral Leadership in the Church: a Normative Approach - Bishop Felix Clarence Orji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a time of confusion, uncertainty, debate, and division regarding what constitutes right moral behaviour, the subject of responsible moral leadership in the church takes on fresh urgency. But at this critical time of need for moral leadership, too many clergy simply mirror the uncertainty or abnegate the responsibility. This book addresses this anomaly specifically by proposing a normative model for moral leadership in the local church. Pastors and leaders of all Christians traditions will find this book very informative and useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book begins with an overview of the historical, theological and biblical bases for Christian leadership and more particularly, what the moral dimension of such leadership means. Various Christian traditions are surveyed for insights into the character, vision and tasks of moral leadership including the authoritative sources for ethical reflection and moral guidance. Since Dr. Felix Orji is a Bishop in the Anglican Communion, he includes a chapter on that tradition to give a sense of the ecclesiastical ethos in which presbyters must exercise such leadership. This is followed by a clear examination of Scripture in regard to what it tells us about moral leadership. This book ends with a detailed normative model for moral leadership in the church and a leadership training resource specifically designed for such leadership.&lt;/p&gt;" />
