  <title>Awesome Creations and Evolution - Kamran Pirnahad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pirnahad has initially gathered the material of this book in the format of different articles as relating to crucial concepts that have affected the history, and evolution of mankind. Afterwards, He decided to transform these inspirational writings into a comprehensive book of revelations. He has received the necessary information not only through endless, sincere and honest research, continuous education, but also through faith in God, intuition, insight, vision, meditation and dreams. &lt;p&gt;
       All contents and basic materials of this book have been thought and initially constructed and defined in the English (American) language, within its socio-cultural, historic and religious course of development. Moreover, all basic concepts have been developed on the basis of a universal conscience, and therefore, most views could be also understood and adapted by other languages, within their specific cultural environment. &lt;p&gt;
       This book has been mostly the result of the insight and many visions the author has been receiving through the capacity of his soul, mind and spirit and within a multi-dimensional platform, therefore, there are only few references to outside   sources. His book has been nevertheles based on a comprehensive library of multi faceted references in different fiels as related to the subject of his book. &lt;p&gt;
       Pirnahad&#39;s effort to prepare and write this book is solely based on the principle that those who possess special spiritual, intellectual and creative talents, should reveal and share their thoughts, works and ideasfor the benefit of mankind. &lt;p&gt;
     The author has reserved high hopes that at this crucial time in human evolution and history, this effort could help everyone gain a better insight into major concepts concerning faith, humanity, history, culture, languages and evolution, and develop a more meaningful and profound way of life.&lt;p&gt;
