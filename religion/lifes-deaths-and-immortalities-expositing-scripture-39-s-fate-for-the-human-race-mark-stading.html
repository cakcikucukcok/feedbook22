  <title>Lifes, Deaths and Immortalities: Expositing Scripture&#39;s Fate for the Human Race - Mark Stading</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book probes the Scriptures for answers to the most important questions that can be asked. What is the fate for each and every Human Being who will have ever lived? (The Bible argues that every Human Being will ultimately take on some form of eternal existence. There is no such thing as Eternal Sleep.) What is the scope and boundaries of Human Existence? (The Bible proposes there are 8 unique states of being. Four of these 8 forms are temporary states of being while the other four are eternal states of being.) Where is the Human Race as a whole headed and what is its ultimate fate? (The Bible declares that the Creator God desires to have eternal communion with Humanity and that He will unveil an eternal Home for He and all redeemed Humanity to share together in the Future Eternity. What awaits unredeemed Humanity is just as provocative, a fate that was never meant for Human Beings.) As this book will present, the Bible does not hold back in supplying answers to these most existential questions." />
