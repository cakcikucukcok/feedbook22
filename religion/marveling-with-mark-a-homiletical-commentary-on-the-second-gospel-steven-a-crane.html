  <title>Marveling with Mark: A Homiletical Commentary on the Second Gospel - Steven A. Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who is This? Even the Wind and the Waves Obey Him! (Mark 4:41)  Who is Jesus? What did he come to accomplish? And what difference does it make in the way I live my life? You will find the answers to these and other questions in this homiletical commentary by expository preacher and Bible college professor Steven Crane. The Gospel of Mark is the gospel about the good news of Jesus Christ. It is a fast-paced, action-packed book--as is this scholarly, yet highly readable commentary. Readers will gain a new appreciation for the content, the organization, and the often-overlooked writing techniques incorporated by Mark into his narrative, and will be invited to apply Scripture in their personal lives. As you read, you will investigate the true nature of Jesus Christ. While some today try to deny Christ&#39;s divinity, explain away his miracles, or discredit the authority of the Word of God--Crane handles these attacks and gives credence to the time-held truths regarding the Son of Man and the inspiration of Scripture. This volume, written in sermonic form, provides clear explanations regarding even the most difficult of Bible passages and includes study questions at the end of each chapter that are suitable for either personal or group use. Readers who have discounted the importance of Mark will be compelled to look at it with fresh eyes and will gain a new appreciation for our second Gospel. As you study, be ready to allow God to work in your life and Marvel with Mark at the person and purpose of Jesus." />
