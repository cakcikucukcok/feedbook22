  <title>Why I Am a Christian - Volume 2 - Kent A. Philpott, Katie LC Philpott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you curious about Christianity? Are you a new follower of Jesus trying to make sense of it all?  Why I am a Christian-Volume 2 looks at critical issues for a living faith in a refreshing and sometimes blunt style: conversion, the doctrine of election, homosexuality, heaven and hell, hypocrisy, the devil, fundamentalism, organized religion, creation and evolution, and the presence of evil are among the topics.  Inside: What troubled me was the question, &quot;How could a loving god condemn one of his creatures to a horrible place forever?&quot;  Prior to my conversion, I knew that Christians were hypocrites; in fact, I used it as an excuse to reject Christian claims.  Many are gambling that the grave is the end, the absolute end of life.  &quot;You&#39;re a fundamentalist, aren&#39;t you?&quot; I didn&#39;t want to answer.  &quot;How did it happen, Francisco, that you gave up?&quot; I asked. He replied, &quot;I just don&#39;t care anymore. What di_ erence does it make anyway? As hard as I try, I keep ending up back here in prison.&quot;  If it&#39;s organized religion, it must be bad. What else would you expect?  The mystic, shaman, santero or santera, wiccan, medium, channeller, psychic, or yogi all rely on the &quot;soul journey&quot; while in trance.  Why all the fuss about hell? Hell is probably not as bad as they say. Hell is the preferred destination for many; few prefer heaven." />
