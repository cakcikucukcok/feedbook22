  <title>Almost Mine - Clifford R. Ward Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vivid descriptions and interesting events parallel human life throughout time make this book a fascinating story for every Christian.  Lucifer, the fallen angel and cause of all evil, is a well-known entity.  However, during the course of Bible study and Biblical history research, the author realizes that there was never a lot of time and thought put into Lucifers life story and the true reason that he fell from grace.  Since he was the first of all created creatures and intelligent beings called into existence, surely he began his life in a state of absolute innocence.  In the evolution of time, the core of his character underwent change in the same manner as do ours from the moment of our birth.  The difference between our growth years, during which many of us fall from grace committing sin and become evil, and his time of growth is a matter of parental and friendship influences that are of a fallen nature.  Lucifer was surrounded by beings loyal to the Creator and the Creator was his teacher.  Therefore, Lucifer had no excuse for his course of action.  He had never seen any examples of disobedience.  Hence, his rebellion was an invention that materialized from within his own heart.
	He is not only the father of lies, but also the inventor of games involving deception and misdirection.  Like the peoples of this world who spend a great deal of their time playing all types of games to distort good into evil, so did Lucifer play a game of deceit.  Even though the angels were naive and did not know the purpose of Lucifers games, just by innocently participating they turned away from the Lord, causing them to lose eternal life.
	Through the course of this reading, you will see both the mercy and love of God extended without limitations to his fallen creation.  You will see the progression of character development, one in obedience to the Creator and the other in disobedience that leads to death.  It is the authors hope that this work will help you develop a deeper relationship with our Redeemer Christ Jesus the Son of God by making you aware of how easy it is to fall from grace." />
