  <title>Creative Bible Lessons in Ezekiel - Anna Aven Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most people avoid teaching from Ezekiel. Not only is it a book full of strange and (sometimes) disturbing imagery, but it also presents a vivid depiction of a God that won&amp;rsquo;t fit neatly into the categories we typically have in mind for him. It&amp;rsquo;s because of these reasons that Ezekiel is an important book to study. But don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid. Creative Bible Lessons in Ezekiel makes it a little easier to bring this bizarre and often confusing book to your students. Following the history of the bestselling Creative Bible Lessons series, this book introduces some new elements into your teaching. Because Ezekiel is so unfamiliar to many people, there is extensive background for leaders, including research from several commentaries and other books. There&amp;rsquo;s enough information there for you to understand the passage enough to be able to teach it confidently. In addition to the background, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a combination of illustrations, activities, movie clips, and song suggestions to help bring the passage to life. Each section ends with a journaling exercise for your students to make the passage personal. Since many adults steer clear of this imaginative book of the Bible, this resource will not only help you teach your students&amp;mdash;you&amp;rsquo;ll learn something yourself! Help your students uncover this book, and lead them closer to the God of Ezekiel&amp;mdash;the God who surprises us frequently and loves us completely.&lt;/p&gt;" />
