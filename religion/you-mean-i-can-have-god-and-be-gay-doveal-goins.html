  <title>You Mean, I Can Have God And Be Gay? - Doveal Goins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As it relates to the LGBTQ community, we frequently hear confessions of people &amp;ldquo;coming out&amp;rdquo; of the closet and announcing to the world, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m gay and I&amp;rsquo;m proud!&amp;rdquo; Contrarily, we also hear stories of people &amp;ldquo;coming out&amp;rdquo; of living a homosexual lifestyle and returning to their traditional religious and moral beliefs. This book is not a &amp;ldquo;coming out&amp;rdquo; tale, it is a &amp;ldquo;coming in&amp;rdquo; testimony; &amp;ldquo;Coming in&amp;rdquo; to the knowledge of my true identity, &amp;ldquo;coming in&amp;rdquo; to self -love, &amp;ldquo;coming in&amp;rdquo; to self-acceptance, &amp;ldquo;coming in&amp;rdquo; to embracing every aspect of my sexuality and spirituality, &amp;ldquo;coming in&amp;rdquo; to true relationship with God. Readers will learn the ins and outs of the God/gay conflict including the mental, emotional and social ramifications connected to this dilemma. Religious discrimination will be unmasked and laid bare for all to see its impact on same gender loving individuals and their friends and family. The same biblical scriptures that have been used to condemn and enslave an entire community of people, will now be used to encourage, defend, and free this same group. By the time the readers finish this entire book, they will have new revelation and insight into their true identity, and they will know that they are fully supported and loved by God. They will discover the path to their everlasting freedom. They will know that they absolutely can have God and be gay!&lt;/p&gt;" />
