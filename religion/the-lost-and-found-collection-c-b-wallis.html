  <title>The Lost and Found Collection - C.B. Wallis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sprinkled with humor, the vignettes of The Lost and Found Collection will open minds and hearts to remarkable possibilities for conquering lifes simple stressors or major struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witness the proof that its never too late to be who you might have been. Just dont try to go it alone. Learn how support may come from the kindness of a stranger or helpful coincidences that just might be God acting anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lost and Found Collection will clarify the difference between happiness and joy, as well as disclose the mystery of paradoxical joy from adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspects of the often surprising essays in The Lost and Found Collection are easily identifiable, but the metamorphosis from agnostic to believer will be a personalized, individual experience. Along the way, discover The Treasure of Hope that comes from only one source. Each candidly poignant vignette from The Lost and Found Collection reaches a memorably uplifting finale that will leave significant messages to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Editorial Board of The Columbia Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lost and Found Collection: The Treasure of Hope by C.B. Wallis is an inspiring non-fiction work with a strong literary tone and a high spiritual message. Part memoir, part inspirational advice, the book combines deep human insights, rich Christian wisdom, and an authentic voice that shares personal experiences in stories and contemplative memories, poetic and scriptural nuggets, and faith-based witnessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the book is told in the first person, recounting the authors experiences that carry relevant messages of overcoming challenges, recovering from calamities, and sustaining hopes for the future. In an eerily appropriate scene, the author recounts the beginning of her spiritual journey as she picked up a new Bible on New Years Day and opened it to see the words: Let there be light! (Genesis 1:3). Indeed, this book sheds light not only on the authors eventful lifes journey, but also on life itself and the ways in which the modern world challenges ones sensibilities and sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most valuable thread in The Lost and Found Collection: The Treasure of Hope is its message of optimism in the face of hardship. The authors personal journey mirror that of the scriptures advice she appropriately quotes: [] when troubles comes your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. For [] when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. (James 1:24.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on her own lifes trials and tribulations, as well as joys and gifts, the author discusses a wide spectrum of subjects of great relevance to allfears and worries, love and care, generosity and dignity, mental health and physical illness, adoption and family, friendship and enmity, life and death, and even war and peace, as they apply to survivors and veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, The Lost and Found Collection: The Treasure of Hope by C.B. Wallis is an uplifting, spiritual memoir, sprinkled with gems of wisdom and faith. Readers will enjoy this book and benefit from it on several levels: It is a fascinating journey of personal growth and empowerment, a series of well-told, memorable stories, intriguing insights into lifes most trying moments, and invaluable guidance when confronted with an unexpected crisis. Highly recommended!&lt;/p&gt;" />
