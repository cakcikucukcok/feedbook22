      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Experience encouragement in your daily struggles and find hope in this seemingly hopeless world as you read the inspirational thoughts of the Women of Grace Writers in this book,  &quot;Mountains of Grace.&quot; This is the work of a group of Christian writers in Southern Arizona, USA, who, along with contributing authors, share how their lives have been inspired and changed by the unfathomable mercy, grace, and love of God, which is extended to all people.  The aim is to provide glimpses of how acceptance of this gift of grace has produced &#39;overcoming lives&#39; for these writers, no matter their circumstances.  Their brave transparency will hopefully energize you to also &#39;stay the course&#39; in difficult times and to lift up others as you climb in your own spiritual walk.  You will see that sometimes this grace is manifested in very mysterious, even supernatural, ways.  So, it is the overwhelming desire of the Women of Grace Writers that God will use this book to open the eyes of their readers to the blessed hope they have found in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ  - How amazing is that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
