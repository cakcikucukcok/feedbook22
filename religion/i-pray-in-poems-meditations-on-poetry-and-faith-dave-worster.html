  <title>I pray in poems: Meditations on Poetry and Faith - Dave Worster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I pray in poems is a journey, a spiritual walk from Advent 1 to Easter Week.  Along the way, readers make twenty stops, exploring great works of art written by poets ranging from William Shakespeare, John Donne, and George Herbert to Elizabeth Bishop, Mary Oliver, and Rumi. Waiting at these stops are also St. Paul, the Teacher of Ecclesiastes, and the authors of the Gospels.  As readers travel with the author through the gloomy twilight of Advent to the starburst of Epiphany, from the silent terror of a stone-cold tomb to the joyful cry of Easter, he also shares moments of personal struggle with anger, fear, and loss in the wake of a difficult diagnosis.  Theologian Stanley Hauerwas writes that Dave Worster &quot;enlivens our lives as Christians by helping us see what we otherwise might miss . . . . By slowing us down, we can see through his expositions of these poems that God is in the details.&quot; Ultimately, Worster&#39;s meditations reveal how the words of the poets and the Word of God combine to transcend material suffering and offer hope for the life to come.  I pray in poems contains 20 meditation, organized around the liturgical seasons, and can serve as facilitation for personal devotion or as a resource for small group discussions." />
