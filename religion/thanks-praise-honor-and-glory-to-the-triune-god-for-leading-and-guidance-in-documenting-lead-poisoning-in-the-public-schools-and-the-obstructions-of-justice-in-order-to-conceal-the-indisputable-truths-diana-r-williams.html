  <title>Thanks, Praise, Honor, and Glory to the Triune God for Leading and Guidance in Documenting Lead Poisoning in the Public Schools and the Obstructions of Justice in Order to Conceal the Indisputable Truths - Diana R. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;School buildings in Maryland, Washington, D.C., New York, Boston, Chicago, South Carolina, and throughout America that have chipping, peeling, and flaking lead-based paint on the interior and exterior are exposing our children and others to lead poisoning. Having renovations performed on these already lead hazardous schools without implementing the proper protective protocols to prevent millions of more microscopic lead dust particles from spreading only compounds the exposure to lead poisoning. Moreover, if these same lead hazardous school buildings, also, have their water supply flowing through leaded pipes, pipes that are connected with lead solder, or have leaded fixtures attached to the fountains, then, our leaders of tomorrow and others are ingesting even more lead poisoning through drinking lead-tainted water.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This non-fiction book documents the truth that a Mathematics teacher, who has maintained her certification and accreditation in lead hazard evaluation and control since 1997 as a Repainting and Maintenance Supervisor, an Inspector Technician, a Lead Abatement Service Contractor, and thus, a Recognized Lead Expert by the Maryland Department of the Environment, identified four schools in Baltimore City that had either deteriorating, chipping, and flaking lead-based paint, major renovations that disturbed lead hazardous components and didnt have the proper protective protocols in place, or drinking water that was lead-contaminated. She attempted on numerous occasions to have the health hazards addressed and resolved. However, the powers that be only wanted to silence her and continue concealing the truth that for over a decade the custodians of these public schools, the owners, and others knowingly, willingly, and negligently exposed lives to lead poisoning. Moreover, the detailed, documented true findings from five Finders of Fact that substantiate that the powers that be retaliated against the messenger because she blew the whistle regarding the lead hazardous in these Baltimore City schools.&lt;/P&gt;" />
