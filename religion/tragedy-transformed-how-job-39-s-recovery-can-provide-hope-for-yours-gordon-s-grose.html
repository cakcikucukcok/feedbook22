  <title>Tragedy Transformed: How Job&#39;s Recovery Can Provide Hope For Yours - Gordon S Grose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Although we prefer to avoid thinking about it, at one time or another, tragedy affects us all. &lt;em&gt;Tragedy Transformed: How Job&amp;rsquo;s Recovery Can Provide Hope for Yours &lt;/em&gt;offers hope for people in such times. Using first-hand interviews with people who experienced tragedy, Grose identifies specific strategies to enable readers to cope&amp;mdash;even transform&amp;mdash;after such events. Stories of sudden death, attempted suicide, long-term mental illness, and chronic physical pain introduce each chapter. &amp;nbsp;The author then discusses biblical Job&amp;rsquo;s similar experience, and concludes his chapters with self-help advice to enable readers to work through their difficulties. Specifically, he provides suggestions on &amp;ldquo;How can I live with this?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;How can I move on?&amp;rdquo; (e.g., depression, anger with God, grief).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When tragedy strikes, one of our most natural responses is to ask, &amp;ldquo;Why did this happen to me?&amp;rdquo; Grose shows how Job articulates that and our other most anguished cries in the midst of a storm. He also deals with questions about God&amp;rsquo;s presence and benevolence during such times. In addition, he shares his own family&amp;rsquo;s struggle with chronic physical illness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this book, Grose draws on his rich experience as a pastor (25 years), and on his counseling service (12 years) to bridge the gap between theological and mental health perspectives. He intends his book to serve any reader willing to reach out for help during tragedy. With practical wisdom drawn from people going through disaster and from Scripture, this book provides hope for recovery, a greater realism, and a deepened relationship with God.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
