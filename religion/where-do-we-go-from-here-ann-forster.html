  <title>Where Do We Go from Here? - Ann Forster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
The book offers variety as it &quot;lifts the lid&quot; on mediumship - a peek behind the scenes.  Have you ever wondered how mediums &quot;know what 
they know&quot;? 
&lt;p&gt;
Some of the answers are here.  
&lt;p&gt;
Have you ever thought about your own death, what it will feel like?  Is there an afterlife or is death the end?
&lt;p&gt;
The read is compelling, chapter after chapter of people&#39;s experiences such as astral journeys to other parts of the country and even
to the Spirit world itself.  Mediumship in children, and accounts of visual phenomena are fascinating, whilst the chapters describing
poltergeist activity, premonitions about disasters and amorous spirits may leave you with a tingle down your spine!
&lt;p&gt;
Ann discusses the emotive, often taboo, subject of suicide.  People who have &quot;lost&quot; someone this way know how they feel about it, 
through her spiritual encounters during the course of her work, she is able to put across the feelings of the Spirits who committed 
suicide and find out what they have to say.
&lt;p&gt;
Some chapters such as &quot;Humour from the Spirit World&quot; will make you laugh, whilst many others, such as &quot;Murder in a Phone Box&quot; and 
&quot;Lisa&quot;, may bring forth tears of emotion.
&lt;p&gt;
Ann pays tribute, throughout her book, to her friend Jenny who passed to Spirit in 1995.  Herself a psychic, she &quot;endured&quot; premonitions 
of tragic incidents such as Lockerbie in 1988.
&lt;p&gt;
This book is for anyone with an open mind who wishes to know more about spiritual and psychic matters, I must warn you to be prepared 
for an emotional roller-coaster ride!
