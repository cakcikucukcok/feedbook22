  <title>God&#39;s Plan from a to Z. - Ben Enslin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is Gods story to bring back all the people of the world back to God as it was before the great fall. How He went about a plan from A to Z. This plan is already laid out in the first book of Genesis.
 It shows His plan where He has chosen a people and throughout history He carried them through with love and punishment to be witnesses to the whole world. The dividing of the twelve tribes that He Himself planned. Two tribes that murdered His only Son as He planned it and ten tribes that had to carry on as witnesses and to bring all the people in the world back to God. 
It is about the seed &quot;Jesus&quot; who was to come and set free the whole world of their sins and His kingdom will fill the whole world until He will return to earth to rule over the whole earth as the conqueror. He is coming to His bride to remarry her under a new covenant, the new Jerusalem, that is Israel, not the Jews but all twelve the tribes of Israel whose calling and job it is to bless all nations of the earth.
You must every moment of the day, where ever you are bless, somebody, even if it is only a friendly smile.  May King Jesus bless you." />
