  <title>Through the Eye of the Soul - Billie Harlan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is there anything beyond this life? Through the Eye of the Soul is a collection of stories from everyday people that affirms a belief that indeed there is a life beyond and a loving connection between souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the Eye of the Soul is a persuasive collection of those personal stories that invite us into the unity of life and death, the unity of all Gods creation.&lt;br /&gt;
Janet Grill, MDiv, retired pastor of St. Andrews Lutheran Church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the Eye of the Soul is a interwoven chronicle of a lifelong learner. The stories that she has culled along her path leave us with the uncanny and reassuring sense that we are not alone in our life journey.&lt;br /&gt;
Betsy Mazzoni, MSW, MPA, assistant executive director of Bethany Hospice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mother grieving the loss of her sons, I found comfort and assurance in each story I read. My belief in an afterlife was strengthened as well as my belief that our connection with our loved ones never dies.&lt;br /&gt;
Kathi A. Leddy, BS, volunteer coordinator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come read and share in moving stories that seek to touch your heart and fill you with hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
