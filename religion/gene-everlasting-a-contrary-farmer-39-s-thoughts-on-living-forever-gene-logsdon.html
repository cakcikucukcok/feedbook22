  <title>Gene Everlasting: A Contrary Farmer&#39;s Thoughts on Living Forever - Gene Logsdon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Gene Logsdon-whom Wendell Berry once called &quot;the most experienced and best observer of agriculture we have&quot;-has a notion: That it is a little easier for gardeners and farmers to accept death than the rest of the populace. Why? Because every day, farmers and gardeners help plants and animals begin life &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; help plants and animals end life. They are intimately attuned to the food chain. They understand how all living things are seated around a dining table, eating while being eaten. They realize that all of nature is in flux.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gene Everlasting&lt;/em&gt; contains Logsdon&#39;s reflections, by turns both humorous and heart-wrenching, on nature, death, and eternity, all from a contrary farmer&#39;s perspective. He recounts joys and tragedies from his childhood in the 1930s and &#39;40s spent on an Ohio farm, through adulthood and child-raising, all the way up to his recent bout with cancer, always with an eye toward the lessons that farming has taught him about life and its mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether his subject is parsnips, pigweed, immortality, irises, green burial, buzzards, or compound interest, Logsdon generously applies as much heart and wit to his words as he does care and expertise to his fields. &lt;/p&gt;" />
