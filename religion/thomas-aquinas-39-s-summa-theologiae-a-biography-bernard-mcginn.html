  <title>Thomas Aquinas&#39;s &quot;Summa theologiae&quot;: A Biography - Bernard McGinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This concise book tells the story of the most important theological work of the Middle Ages, the vast &lt;i&gt;Summa theologiae&lt;/i&gt; of Thomas Aquinas, which holds a unique place in Western religion and philosophy. Written between 1266 and 1273, the &lt;i&gt;Summa&lt;/i&gt; was conceived by Aquinas as an instructional guide for teachers and novices and a compendium of all the approved teachings of the Catholic Church. It synthesizes an astonishing range of scholarship, covering hundreds of topics and containing more than a million and a half words&amp;#8212;and was still unfinished at the time of Aquinas&amp;#8217;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Bernard McGinn, one of today&amp;#8217;s most acclaimed scholars of medieval Christianity, vividly describes the world that shaped Aquinas, then turns to the Dominican friar&amp;#8217;s life and career, examining Aquinas&amp;#8217;s reasons for writing his masterpiece, its subject matter, and the novel way he organized it. McGinn gives readers a brief tour of the &lt;i&gt;Summa&lt;/i&gt; itself, and then discusses its reception over the past seven hundred years. He looks at the influence of the &lt;i&gt;Summa&lt;/i&gt; on such giants of medieval Christendom as Meister Eckhart, its ridicule during the Enlightenment, the rise and fall of Neothomism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the role of the &lt;i&gt;Summa&lt;/i&gt; in the post&amp;#8211;Vatican II church, and the book&amp;#8217;s enduring relevance today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing the remarkable life of this iconic work, McGinn&amp;#8217;s wide-ranging account provides insight into Aquinas&amp;#8217;s own understanding of the &lt;i&gt;Summa&lt;/i&gt; as a communication of the theological wisdom that has been given to humanity in revelation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
