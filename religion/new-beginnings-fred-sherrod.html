  <title>New Beginnings - Fred Sherrod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    As the divinely inspired Word of God, the primary purpose of the Bible is to probe the depths of the human heart more skillfully and purposefully than any
    surgeon could possibly imagine. With this in mind, my intent in New Beginnings is to follow the riveting narratives of Genesis and Acts with a primary
    emphasis on the devotional and inspirational elements. From a Christian perspective, I cannot imagine four beginnings with more historical significance
    than those emphasized in these two informative books: (1) the creation of the world with all its living things, (2) the foundation of IsraelGods chosen
    nation, (3) the establishment of the Churchthe Body of Christ, and the most incredible beginning of all, (4) people from every walk of life being born
    again by the power of the gospel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    My personal perceptions and convictions have evolved from a background of thirty-three years using the scientific method in chemical research, and even
    longer exploring the eternal truths of the Bible as a Christian and minister. I might add that the practical experiences I gained as a husband, father of
    two girls, and bivocational pastor prevent my viewpoints from being too esoteric or theoretical in nature. Whether a casual reader or serious student of
    the Bible, I hope you find New Beginnings informative if not illuminating, interesting if not stirring, and encouraging if not inspiring. Finally, if your
    Christian fervor needs rekindling, my prayer is that these pages nourish and revitalize youlike a steaming bowl of my mothers chicken soup on a cold,
    rainy day.
