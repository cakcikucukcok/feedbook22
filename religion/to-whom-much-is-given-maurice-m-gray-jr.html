  <title>To Whom Much Is Given - Maurice M Gray Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At twenty-five, Max Carson&amp;rsquo;s goals are to live a life pleasing to God, to achieve as a journalist and to find the woman God has for him. However, those dreams just won&amp;rsquo;t go away- - -&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Donna Randall is twenty-two and establishing her adult life. Having moved to Delaware after college, her concerns are to find a job, a church home and eventually, a husband. She has no time for dreams and visions, but she has to deal with them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Merry Lucas is determined to have the life of luxury she thinks she deserves. But, her plans will be derailed if she can&amp;rsquo;t forestall a threat from her past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With Max as a best friend and all the women he can handle, Fred Bennett&amp;rsquo;s life is good. However, something is missing. Is Merry the answer, or only another question? And could Max be right about God?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yolanda Mason has helped Donna decipher prophetic dreams and visions since they were children, but this time, Yolanda can&amp;rsquo;t shake the feeling that the stakes are much higher.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Max and Donna&amp;rsquo;s dreams draw them together, and they learn that their individual dreams are pieces of a puzzle. If they don&amp;rsquo;t solve the mystery, hundreds of innocents will die. Max and Donna are caught up in an adventure wherein they explore the mysteries of the Holy Spirit and of their own hearts. Their only recourse is to trust God to work things out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
