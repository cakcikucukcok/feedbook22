  <title>Mastering Self - Donald G. Hanna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mastering selfoften desired, seldom achieved, and easier said than done. It is an arduous, lifelong process of becoming. A journeynot a destination. A directionnot perfection. A disciplinenot a diversion. Mastering self does not naturally exist in the human condition. It must be cultivated by lifelong learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastering Self is for critical thinkers wanting to become what they should be. It provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;#149 a paradigm to clarify your core ethos and code of conduct; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a template to evaluate your fundamental beliefs, principles, and values; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a lens to view your world; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a grid to filter your thoughts, decisions, and actions;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a linchpin to stabilize your life; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a blueprint to comprehend your bearing in lifes journey and destination; and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a benchmark to measure significance in your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastering Self presents relevant principles and commentary applicable to leading self and others. Understanding them strengthens interpersonal relationships. Embracing them increases personal influence. Practicing them benefits anyone responsible for other people. A comprehensive reference for leaders, this handbook is based on timeless truths and virtues for reference, reflection, or contemplative study. It provides a biblical worldview for perspective and old-school insight for todays culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastering Self includes two primers with commentary, white papers regarding issues in life, the authors Scot heritage influence, and memoirs. The primers are written from a practitioners perspective gained from twenty-four years leading three police departments, teaching command officers at police academies, and teaching leadership at a university. The white papers juxtapose personal worldview and ethos with Gods Word and manner of living. They reveal a deep conviction that God counsels and confides in those who fear Him (Ps. 25:14) and honors those who honor Him (1 Sam. 2:30). These papers result from reading, teaching, writing, and pondering to keep my heart with all diligence regarding issues in life (Prov. 4:23)often in the counsel chamber of God. This work is a labor of love and pertains to lifes ultimate question: God or self?&lt;/p&gt;" />
