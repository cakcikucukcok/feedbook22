      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As We Grow Together Workbook is a workbook for expectant parents. This pregnancy is God&amp;rsquo;s blessing to you and your family. This is a time when reconciling yourself to God is the prime activity, with a closer communication with your mate. AWGT workbook allows you to answer questions about your pregnancy and the life after the birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this workbook, you will investigate who you think you are and discover who will be as a new parent. For those of you thinking: &amp;ldquo;but I am not a new parent.&amp;rdquo; I beg to differ. You are a new parent each time you parent. In between children, we grow, change, learn, and decide to be different parents. So you will parent differently. Lastly, you are new to that little one and that little one is new to you. While experience is the best teacher, more of our experiences demand our change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of parenting changes daily with new challenges which our experience does not always lend itself to as a solution. It still takes a village to raise a child. The concept of parenting is at best a challenge. This statement does not negate the ability of the parent, however, it does reinforce the need of the leadership of the Holy Spirit. God provides us with the tools we need to parent so we need to rely totally on Him. The child is a gift. We are stewards of the gift.&lt;/p&gt;" />
