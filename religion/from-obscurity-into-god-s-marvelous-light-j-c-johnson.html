  <title>From Obscurity into God’S Marvelous Light - J. C. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We were created for a purpose, but in this constantly changing world, many of us become disillusioned by life and fail to discover our purposes and embrace our destinies. We meander through life, seeking to find ourselves and a meaning for our existence; yet we remain disoriented and unfilled. But there is hope. Our lives do not have to be like this; we can discover our purpose and walk in our predestined roles. The person God created us to be is within us but has become obscured with the trivial issues we allow to define us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author J. C. Johnsons &lt;em&gt;From Obscurity into Gods Marvelous Light: Finding the You that You Were Predestined to Be&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates how answering Gods call on our lives empowers us to find our purposes and live in our destinies. When we answer Gods call, we embark on a life-changing journey. We are transformed and become the persons God intends us to be. We emerge from obscurity and into His marvelous light. Johnson uses her personal experiences and life lessons to inspire and empower us to travel our journey and to find and embrace the person God predestined us to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you willing to find who you were predestined to be? &lt;em&gt;From Obscurity into Gods Marvelous Light: Finding the You that You Were Predestined to Be&lt;/em&gt; will help you find that person and leave a legacy that will impact the lives of others for generations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
