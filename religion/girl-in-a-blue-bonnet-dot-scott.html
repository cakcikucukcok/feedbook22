  <title>Girl  in  a  Blue  Bonnet - Dot Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHEN   AFRICA CALLS,  ANYTHING  CAN  HAPPEN  ..
When eighteen-year-old Daisy Quartermans longing for adventure and love of humanity lead her to volunteer as a Salvation Army missionary in South Africa in 1896, she has no way of knowing what lies ahead.  Leaving her family and friends in England, she sets sail for a foreign land.
While stationed in the town of Mafeking, then under the military command of Colonel Baden-Powell, the Boers declare war on the British forces in October, 1899.  The town is about to be besieged, and Daisy finds herself in danger as she is caught up in the bitter conflict of the Boer War, forcing her to make some far-reaching decisions.
And when she meets the love of her life, she wonders how long this war will keep them apart, or whether their plans will ever become a reality. 
 Will their faith sustain them through all the danger, turmoil, achievements and heartache as they go about their daily lives in a beautiful, restless country?" />
