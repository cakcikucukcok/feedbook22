  <title>Living Life with Joy in My Heart - Ruthann Lees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following the sudden, unexpected death of her loving husband of thirty-six years, a widow searches deeply for her will to live and feel again. She reaches in for calm and comes out with a story of grief and body/mind/spirit reunion. Through journaling, Ruthie finds Don again and receives wisdom from Spirit. Readers who have experienced the loss of a loved one or are interested in after-death communication will find solace in the message. The author shares her story with us, compelled by her renewed desire to live, feel, know, heal, create, serve and be. As a retired psychotherapist, I would recommend this book as an invaluable tool to help others assuage their grief. It helps make finite the gap between here and hereafter. Ruthie has pointed the way for all of us who have suffered losses of loved ones to share more fully in the wondrous continuation of life that transcends death. Sandra Nohre, PhD, Ft. Myers, Florida Ruthie just sits down and has a good cup of tea with the reader. Joy Johnson, Centering Corporation, Omaha, Nebraska I found this book helpful and reassuring. Ruthies open heart and spirit shine through. Seanne Larson Emerton, licensed marriage and family therapist, Grand Island, Nebraska&lt;/p&gt;" />
