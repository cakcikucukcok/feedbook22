  <title>Journey of the Self - Judith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who are the Wayshowers? What is the self of my being? How did I become separated from truth? What is the True Mind?
From the time of your birth into being there have been these prevailing truths: you are love and you are loved; you are complete; and you are the spark from the Divine. The guide named Mother, the true author of this book, leads you through the minefield of deception that has held you back from the truth of who you are. She takes you back to the beginning of this planet and its first inhabitants, shares ancient wisdom and insights about judgment, forgiveness, and the human mind and much, much more. There is and has only been one truth, and Mother lights this spark of truth within you with great wisdom and clarity.
Come forth into the act of being and believe in the self is the cornerstone of her message. Mother speaks personally to each of you, and with expert guidance, shows how to come forth in this very important time of ascension. She speaks of the Wayshowers, the enlightened ones who have come back at this time to lead this planet through the transition from falsehood to truth and from duality into singularity. Perhaps you are one of these Wayshowers and her message will help to light your way through your Journey of the Self.
He who knows others is wise; he who knows himself is enlightened.
						- Lao-Tzu" />
