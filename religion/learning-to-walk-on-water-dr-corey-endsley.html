  <title>Learning to Walk on Water - Dr. Corey Endsley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being limited in life is a helpless feeling. The mentality of our society today is limited in their finances, relationships, knowledge, and even in health. The enemy knows that if he can keep you limited, he will keep you from becoming a threat to his kingdom. What if you could be limitless? What if you were free to give when God said give or go when God said to go? It is not impossible. It will take faith and a new mentality to believe God can use you as his instrument. Jesus taught the importance of having faith and the benefits of having a limitless mentality. Faith got Peter out of the boat, but his limited mentality made him sink. None of us have arrived. Learning to Walk on Water is a journey that every Christian must take. If we desire to be used by God to the fullest, we need to step beyond the confines of a limited mentality and do as Peter did. He learned to walk on water!" />
