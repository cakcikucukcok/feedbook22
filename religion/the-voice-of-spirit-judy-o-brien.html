  <title>The Voice of Spirit - Judy O’Brien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Voice of Spirit: A Mediums Story&lt;/i&gt; introduces a clinical nurse specialist whose vocation to become a medium led her to devote her full attention to the messages that spirits desire to share with the people they have left behind in this world. Judy OBrien, whose work has given rise to her business, Angels Amongst Us, speaks with a conversational and honest voice in the pages of this book that blends the genres and intentions of a memoir, a spiritual reflection, and a guide.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As the author tells her lifes story, she notes, I can communicate with loved ones who have crossed over. I have been aware of this abilityor giftsince I was five, but it wasnt until many years later, that I wanted to learn more about spirituality and understand the messages I was receiving because I had always thought they were just my intuition. Readers following her on the journey narrated in &lt;i&gt;The Voice of Spirit&lt;/i&gt; will traverse the same path of deepening insight and recognize the blessings that come from listening to the messages that arise and contemplating their sources and meanings.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Voice of Spirit: A Mediums Story,&lt;/i&gt; Judy OBrien desires to validate the existence of spirits for all whom those same spirits have left behind. As you read her story, you can find hope and peace and appreciate the love that transcends the boundaries of the physical world and that beckons you toward the spiritual world in which eternal love never dies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
