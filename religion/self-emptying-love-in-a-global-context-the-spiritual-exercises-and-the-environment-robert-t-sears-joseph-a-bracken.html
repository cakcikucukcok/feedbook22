  <title>Self-Emptying Love in a Global Context: The Spiritual Exercises and the Environment - Robert T. Sears, Joseph A. Bracken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Care for the environment is an ever more pressing concern in today&#39;s world in which narrow self-interest has blinded us to the growing pollution of atmosphere and seas and the destruction of animal species caused by our indifference and neglect. Christianity has been blamed in part for this because of a misunderstanding of the Biblical call to have dominion over creation. Our spiritual tradition has indeed so focused on human salvation that the Earth has been seen simply as a transient environment that will be left behind in the end.    In response, this little book highlights another spiritual tradition within Western Christianity that affirms that creation itself will also be transformed with humanity through the self-emptying love of God. God&#39;s dominion, after all, is service rather than despotic control, the raising up of the lowly of this Earth and of the Earth itself as part of a cosmic community. The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius are examined in this light as a call not only to join Christ in redeeming humanity, but also in extending Christ&#39;s care and love to all creation that longs for the freedom of the children of God." />
