  <title>From a Wooden Manger to a Wooden Cross - Laura Russell Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped Him &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Luke 2:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith: who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 12:2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see the wooden manger, we see the birth of the Savior of the world. It was the beginning of the way of salvationanother display of Gods great love for mankind. Then when we see the wooden cross, we see the death of the Savior of the world. His death on that cross was to pay the sin debt of mankind, which was accomplished through the shedding of His blood. In the years in between, He went about revealing His God and our God. He taught the truths of His Father and our Father. This collection of writings comes from some of those truths He has taught me. My prayer is that as you read these He will reveal Himself to you in a fresh new way. May He be glorified in all these words!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;" />
