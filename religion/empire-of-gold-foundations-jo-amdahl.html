  <title>Empire of Gold: Foundations - Jo Amdahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;War consumed the world. Everything changed, politically, economically, and religiously. It would never be the same again, and the events have been recorded for us to learn from them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Empire of Gold &lt;/em&gt;is a chronicle crucial to both Christians and Jews, of great interest to historians, and just a good story for anyone else. It is a story of the supernatural and of God&amp;rsquo;s grace in unendurable trials. It is a story of power, war, treachery, and romance, all in epic proportions. Even better, it is true. Who said history was boring?&amp;nbsp;The prequel to the Empire of Gold Series, Foundations sets the stage for the extraordinary story of the Babylonian Captivity of the Jews. It covers the years of 628 to 610 BC. It introduces us to the people, places and politics of the ancient world.&amp;nbsp;The lives and deeds of Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel mix with those of the legendary Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus the Great and the pharaohs of old as chaos erupts. Foundations covers the years 628 to 610 BC and sets the stage for what is to follow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
