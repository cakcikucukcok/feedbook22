  <title>It May Be Simple, but It Isn’T Easy - Kara B. Schmidt M.A. R.N.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Late one night, the author was startled awake by a loud voice saying, You have been chosen. 
She discovered the voice was in her mind. She said out loud, To do what? 
The answer was To write your books. She was astounded. 
It was only then, when she was rocked to her core by these spiritual happenings that had no rational explanation, that she realized there was definitely another dimension to her life. She was changed forevernot all at once, but little by little over many years. 
This is the revealing story of those amazing and profound occurrences. Until now, she has never spoken about them because she thought her friends and family would think she was crazy. Its only now, more than twenty-five years later, that she has found the courage to share her spiritual journey. 
The title, It May Be Simple, But It Isnt Easy, suggests that some of us know we can connect with God and the Holy Spirit, but how many of us actually do so on a regular basis? How many of us remember to forgive everyone and/or send love to all that we meet? 
This is the true story of the authors spellbinding spiritual journey and how she learned to become a spiritually based, courageous woman." />
