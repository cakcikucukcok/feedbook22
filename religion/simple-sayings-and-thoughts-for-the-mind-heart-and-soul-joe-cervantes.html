  <title>Simple Sayings and Thoughts for the Mind, Heart and Soul - Joe Cervantes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding are similar to finding a treasure chest full of diamonds and nuggets of gold. How can anyone not take advantage of such an abundance of wealth? In the midst of so much confusion, one needs to take the time to believe that there is wealth in the word of God and from his people to overcome such daily adversaries. We are challenged in our everyday lives, but may you take that first step of faith living for God and in helping others with love where there is failure. I know many books have been written with different opinions and advice by different writers about God and life. As the author of this book, Ive tried to give some simple wisdom and understanding in so many areas of our lives, making it simple to understandand, of course, with some sense of humor. As one who goes alone through the maze of life, sometimes it requires us to learn quickly in order to find the key to the cross. So where advice isnt available, we are tempted, get off course, and learn the hard way, which gets more complicated if we become stubborn. Just like the whole armor of God protects every part of our spiritual and physical bodies, taking some good advice and motivation will help us progress as a child of God. For those who love to make things possible by taking advice, may this book help you to change your route and save you time. There are over six thousand thoughts of my personal sayings, which can be used as a text starter for a sermon or a conservation piece for inspiration. Please enjoy them; youve struck it rich with some great wisdom.Joe Cervantes." />
