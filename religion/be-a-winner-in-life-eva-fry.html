  <title>Be a Winner in Life - Eva Fry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Be a Winner in Life&lt;/I&gt; is written for kids, to save them from the destructive life styles so many of them are falling into. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;It is also a support to parents who are raising their kids at a most difficult time. It is written to give parents help, hope and encouragement.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Our younger generation is at risk. So many are into drugs and alcohol, at an early age, and are on the road to destruction. There are so many negative influences, which they blindly fall into. Most of these young people are unaware of the consequences of the choices they are making.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Eva Fry is fully aware of the consequences of their choices. Each week she sees the result, in kids locked up at Juvenile Hall, in San Diego who are destroying their future and potential. She has presented her program &lt;I&gt;Be a Winner in Life&lt;/I&gt; for eight years to over 10,000 troubled youth and understands why they are locked up and what they must do to get their lives back on track.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;This book talks about good and evil and making the right choices and the consequences of bad choices. She talks about plain and simple God given truths, which result in happy and successful lives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;This book is a must read for all young people and their parents.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;If you have a child or friend who is now locked up, this book could save their life. Make sure they have a copy and encourage them to read it.    &lt;/P&gt;" />
