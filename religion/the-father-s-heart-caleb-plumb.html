  <title>The Father’S Heart - Caleb Plumb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is a revolution happening right now all over the world as believers in Jesus Christ are rediscovering the words of Jesus: I came to reveal the Father (John 1:18). When you learn to live life with an awareness of and attention to the Fathers presence, everything changes. Believers move from religion to relationship. Faith in God shifts from duty to an exciting journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you could live with a supernatural confidence that your Father in heaven loves you, is all-powerful, and is always with you! How would that change your life? What if you also discovered you could hear His voice and feel His presence every day? This book was written to encourage every believer to walk in this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;me&gt;The Fathers Heart&lt;/em&gt; consists of personal stories from author Caleb Plumbs life. He details triumphs and mistakes of attempting to live on fire for God. He pulls back the curtain to his prayer life, dreams, visions, and supernatural encounters with a desire to inspire others to pursue the presence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes in the spirit of Jeremiah 29:13: You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all of your heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
