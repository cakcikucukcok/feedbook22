  <title>Charismatic Captivation: Authoritarian Abuse &amp; Psychological Enslavement in Neo-Pentecostal Churches - Steven Lambert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Multitudes of sincere and trusting believers are caught in the virtually invisible web of religious captivation in the churches they attend, the ministries they are under, and the networks they are aligned with, and don&amp;#39;t know it!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These faithful followers of Christ are unaware victims of spiritual abuse, psychological enslavement, and exploitation perpetrated under the heavy-hand of hyper-authoritarianism. That is to say, the leadership of the church-group of which they are a part is dominating, controlling, manipulating, and exploiting their followers for&amp;nbsp;personal gain and private kingdom-building.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Through systematic indoctrination, victims are duped into accepting as biblical and beneficial the oppressive and abusive predominance imposed on them by unscrupulous, tyrannical church-leaders. Without realizing the spiritual effect of what they are doing, myriads of sincere and faithful followers of Christ, in submitting themselves and surrendering their God-given right to self-governance, or personal autonomy, unto their spiritual leaders, have become &amp;quot;slaves of men&amp;quot; in blatant violation of God&amp;#39;s explicit warning against that very thing: &amp;quot;DO NOT BECOME SLAVES OF MEN!&amp;quot; (1 Cor. 7:23).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Authoritarian abuse (aka, &amp;quot;spiritual abuse&amp;quot;) is one of the most widespread and troubling problems facing the Church today. Indeed, the truth is that ecclesiastical enslavement and exploitation is pandemic in many sectors of 21st Century Christendom, though the churches and ministries employing it go to great lengths to disguise and conceal it. What makes the pandemic problem even more insidious is that many of the perpetrators and proliferators of these spiritually repressive teachings and techniques are respected, and in some cases, revered spiritual leaders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moreover these autocratic systems of religious hegemony are being imposed in church-groups espousing orthodox Christian beliefs, whose memberships are comprised of a cross section of average Americans&amp;mdash;individuals and families&amp;mdash;of every race, education level, station, status, and vocation, rather than radical, fringe religious sects and cults as many uninformed people would assume.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though religious predomination is certainly nothing new, and hyper-authoritarianism is by no means limited to the Neo-Pentecostal branch of the Church, it has especially flourished in Charismatic and other Neo-Pentecostal groups since it was infused into the very fabric, foundation, and functions of that branch of the Church in the early- to mid-1970s through what became known as the &amp;quot;Discipleship or Shepherding Movement.&amp;quot; The doctrines and practices spawned in that false movement remain an integral part of the operations of many church-groups yet today!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, what many Neo-Pentecostals do not understand is that with the emergence of the plethora of &amp;quot;networks&amp;quot; now in existence, there is an invisible web of interrelated organizations that secretly control and direct everything substantive that goes on in the realm of Neo-Pentecostal churches, including &amp;quot;approving&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;blacklisting&amp;quot; ministers and leaders who refuse to submit to the secret &amp;quot;Charismatic chain-of-command.&amp;quot; Charismatic Captivation uncovers those secret organizations and reveals their surreptitious, sordid, and self-aggrandizing agenda.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Written from an &amp;quot;insider&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; perspective by a noted Charismatic minister who is also a lettered theologian and consulted by the media as an expert on Christian cults, &lt;em&gt;Charismatic Captivation&lt;/em&gt;, has been appraised and praised by ministers, scholars, theologians, church leaders, and laymen as one of the most comprehensive as well as convincing volumes written to date on the prevalent problem of authoritarian abuse, yet without the &amp;quot;Charismatic-bashing&amp;quot; in which some other books citing spiritual abuse engage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
