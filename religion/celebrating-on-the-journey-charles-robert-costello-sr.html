  <title>Celebrating on the Journey - Charles Robert Costello Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Celebrating on the Journey - A Guide to a Catholic-Jewish Seder for 100 is a one of a kind guide that provides the reader with the essentials of a hands-on guide which will enable a spiritual encounter and Faithing- Befriending transformation.
The guide is introduced with a no-nonsense set of questions and answers which will aid you in the Plan and Organizational phases of your Seder meal.  These Q/As address the critical Who, What, Why, Where, When and How issues which have to be taken into consideration in the beginning phases of your planning.  If this is your communities first Seder approval steps should begin the month after Easter this year for next year.  It takes 4 - 6 weeks to unfold the process before the date and time of your Seder.
In the initial phase of discussion ---a short theological reflection introduces a theological understanding of the Passover in reference to the Last Supper.  The Seder celebration itself is symbolic of many different foods, prayers, songs and gestures. These are covered so that a complete catechesis may be done.
Your guide has 14 individual appendices to which (each issue) of the process is covered.  Peoples time is important.  A core team must be developed. To achieve this end, appendices 1, 2, 3,4 and 5 are worksheets in which you can develop the core team and team members.  Protocol should be followed.  This must be a team effort not just several select souls.
Appendix 8 contains recipies which each of the attendees of the Seder are to bring.  Each family is requested to bring enough for themselves plus four extra attendees.  There will be a sign-up weekend at which recipes can be chosen.
Concluding, the last two appendices contain: #13 Tips for a successful Seder; and, #14 Bibliography and Resources." />
