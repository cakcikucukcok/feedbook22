  <title>Jesus and the Family: Crisis and Conversion in the American Household - Frank G. Honeycutt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are few more loaded words in American life than family. Jesus grew up in one and honored his parents in fulfillment of the commandments. But his teachings on family life stand among the most jarring things he ever said. Jesus invites serious followers to hate mother and father. He predicts discipleship will bring division rather than peace to family life. He completely recasts the definition of kinship as whoever does the will of God. In an era when families face unprecedented challenges sticking together for the long haul, Jesus&#39;s words at first glance seem to welcome disintegration of the Christian household rather than offering healing and a clear way forward. This book examines the off-putting words of Jesus in the wider context of radical allegiance and baptismal priority. In a country where family devotion is akin to honoring the national flag, Honeycutt unpacks an old word for a new generation of Christians called to place Jesus first in all things. It&#39;s only then that we&#39;ll be able to truly help those who share a common roof and lineage." />
