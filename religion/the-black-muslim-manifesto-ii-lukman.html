  <title>The Black Muslim Manifesto Ii - Lukman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The compilation of a decade of essays and online ideological struggle with members of Lukman&#39;s e-mail chat group formed the basis for &quot;The Black Muslim Manifesto: From Inside the Belly of the Beast&quot;. The continuation of that process has called &quot;The Black Muslim Manifesto II: A Luta Continua&quot; into existence. Since the publication of the first &quot;Manifesto&quot;, Lukman has continued his analysis of the unfolding global dynamic. Additionally, time has born witness to the accuracy of some of the &quot;Manifesto&#39;s&quot; prognostications. For example, we no longer have to speculate about what Obama will do once he&#39;s in the WHITE House. Lukman is proud, but not happy, to say that he was one of the few who was NEVER deceived by the &quot;Obama Ploy&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukman felt compelled to rush &quot;A Luta Continua&quot; to print because much of his analysis, in &quot;Manifesto II&quot;, has already proven to be prescient. Events are moving forward at such a rapid pace that many of his predictions have become history. Lukman didn&#39;t want to be accused of that for which he condemns our &quot;rearguard leadership&quot;; namely, &quot;Monday Morning Quarterbacking&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;" />
