  <title>Burnt Offerings - Rabbi David H. Chanofsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Coincidence can color our experiences in ways that cannot be predicted. When the ordinary becomes the extraordinary, it transforms commonplace happenings and gives them new signifi cance and wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For half a century, &lt;b&gt;Rabbi David H. Chanofsky&lt;/b&gt; has witnessed these transformative miracles, and here, he shares some of his favorite memories and lessons. He shares tales from his years of fighting anti-Semitism in America and of his efforts to defend the rights of Jews everywhere. Through the prism of humor and pathos as they relate to Jewish life, his experiences seek to inspire thought, laughter, tears, and debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there such a thing as conservative and
reform Judaism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Judaism view intermarriage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do so many people feel alone in a
crowded synagogue? Is there a solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when religion and politics
intersect in Israel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are your Jewish superheroes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rabbis early experiences gave him a
lifelong commitment to Jewish survival and a zealous love of the United States. Judaism is central to his insights, and he approaches these issues with strong, often controversial points of view that he hopes will challenge your perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
