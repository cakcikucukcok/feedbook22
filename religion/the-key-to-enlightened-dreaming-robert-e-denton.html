The Key To Enlightened Dreaming
The Spiritual survival Guide Beyond 2012
ABOUT THE BOOKS
The Key To Enlightened Dreaming was originally published  in 1998 as a full color hardcover book with original spiritual artwork as well as B&amp;W line drawings. It teaches the reader to break down dreams into their four main components so that the symbols may be ascertained to allow the dreamer to see the message within. At that time I was raising a young family and found that the dreams of a family unit are priceless in guiding young children and parents in the ways of Spirit so that God and our spiritual guides can have a direct contact to us and guide our daily interactions.
In the fall of 2011 I began to have visions of white light that seemed to be directing me to write another book to warn the planet (particularly the United States of America) of impending natural disasters that are about to hit the earth. Even a date has been given as to when this will truly begin. These visions also told me that my techniques in reading the images of Spirit through Dreams, Waking Dreams, Visions, and Soul Experiences, would be the best form of protection and direction for those who could learn It&#39;s ways. As a result I have put the two books together, one written in 1998 and the other in the fall of 2011 through the spring of 2012 to release to the world to warn those in the path of the upcoming destrution and give them a means to protect themselves and their families through this direct connection to spirit.
I would like to sell the two books as one with full color art for 9.99..." />
