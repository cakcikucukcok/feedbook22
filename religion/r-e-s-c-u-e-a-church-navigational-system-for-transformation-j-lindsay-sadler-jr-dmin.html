  <title>R.E.S.C.U. E.: a Church Navigational System for Transformation - J. Lindsay Sadler Jr. Dmin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;R.E.S.C.U.E. is a response to the whys in church life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Why do the majority of churches have only half or less members attend on the Lords Day? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why have approximately 40% of pastors been involved in affairs and 50% of their marriages ended in divorce? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why is there infighting in the church and why are there so many church splits? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why are there so many pharisaical people in churches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why is the power of the Holy Spirit absent in churches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why is Biblical truth watered down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why is pastor or elder leadership not trusted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why do congregations think they can lead themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why isnt the church reaching more lost souls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why is church discipline off most church radars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why is the average percentage of giving per member only between 1 and 3 percent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why is a pastors tenure only two to four years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why do churches fear change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; After 33 years of ministry overseeing all sizes of congregations, I have dealt with those whys. If churches do not address the whys, many will sink into the ecclesiastical graveyard or remain afloat in stagnate waters. I believe R.E.S.C.U.E. can navigate churches to be transformed into an impactful and fruitful body of believers that glorifies our Lord!&lt;/p&gt;" />
