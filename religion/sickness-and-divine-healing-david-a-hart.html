  <title>Sickness and Divine Healing - David A. Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sickness! Affliction! No one is exempt! In some manner these will touch our lives, either personally or in someone we know. When sickness and affliction occurs, we have questions, such as, &quot;Why is this happening God? Are You angry with me? Have I done something wrong? Are You going to heal me? If I&#39;m not healed, does it mean You don&#39;t love me or care about me? How much faith do I need before I&#39;m healed? Isn&#39;t it Your will that everyone is healed? Did Satan cause my sickness? Did I cause this problem?&quot;&lt;p&gt;
This book is what you need if you have been looking for answers to these questions: Has God changed? Does God cause sickness and pain in anyone? Is it ever God&#39;s will to not heal? Is lack of healing due to lack of faith? Does everyone honestly want to be healed? Can we prevent our healing? Should we claim to be healed if it is apparent we are not? Were the stripes Christ suffered meant for our physical healing or were they meant for our spiritual healing? Is anointing the sick with oil important? What is the most important healing?&lt;p&gt;
The truths in this book are long overdue. It is time that false teachings are exposed and Biblical truths are presented. Personal opinions and biased answers are not what the sick and afflicted need. They need Biblical answers, and they will find the answers in this book.&lt;p&gt;" />
