  <title>&quot;Avm&quot; a Victorious Michelle - Michelle J. Walter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A stunningly honest testimony of a woman who survived a life-threatening illness and was saved eternally in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brian Campbell, Christian Psychologist&lt;br /&gt;Author of Pearls: Scriptures to Live By; Godly Counsel: Scriptures for Todays World; Christlike: Walking the Walk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uplifting memoir chronicles the journey of a remarkable woman who was able to overcome an unhappy childhood, failed marriages, and a serious brain injury through her faith, connection with the Holy Scriptures and a supportive family. Interlaced with relevant Scripture references, readers will find this book inspirational and encouraging for anyone who needs hope during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Brinda LeBleu, Assistant Pastor of First United Methodist Church of Oviedo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fast-paced and deceptively simple testimony of faith in Gods grace and forgiveness that is a must-read for anyone who thinks they are beyond the bounds of grace or who has difficulty in seeing Gods goodness in the midst of trouble. Reflecting back on her life, Michelle shares an intimate picture of her coming of age, teen-age marriage, abortions, remarriage, motherhood, divorce and the brain surgery that changed everything. With humor and unapologetic honesty the reader can easily see the hand of God at work, guiding, correcting, holding, His daughter as she travels from simple belief toward full surrender to Him. It is a story full of love for family and friends and an expression of joy and deep gratitude for the life she now lives in the Lord. What a good read. Let the journey continue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Mary Isaacs Frost, Pastor, Shady Hills United Methodist Church&lt;/p&gt;" />
