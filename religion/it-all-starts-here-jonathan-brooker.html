  <title>It All Starts Here - Jonathan Brooker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It All Starts Here is a thorough, funny, engaging, challenging, and biblical walk-through of what it means to follow Christ specifically designed for the new believer. No longer do youth pastors and church leaders need to leave the new believer with the now what? question still lingering in their mind after theyve made that important decision. With this resource you can know that they are walking through the gospel message and basic Christian beliefs on a 31-day journey that will cover the kind of topics that would take months of sermons to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just check out what others have said about this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This captivating and relationally-driven book serves as a dynamic and interactive resource for youth ministries looking to engage their new believers in what it means to truly follow Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Jeanne Mayo, Founder and President of Youth Leader&#39;s Coach, International Speaker and Author, Director of Youth and Young Adult Outreach, Victory World Church, Norcross, GA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally a book that takes students and leaders to the next phase of Christianity in a thought provoking and yet personal manner! This book is sure to be an instant tool for discipleship and a classic to draw from for generations to come! Get this book and make disciples!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Pat Schatzline, Evangelist, Mercy Seat Ministries, Author of &quot;Why is God so mad at me?&quot;, Trussville, AL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great resource for youth leaders who are serious about the task of making disciples. Its highly-practical and relational approach will help students to stick with the exciting journey of growing in their new faith in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Scotty Gibbons, Student Ministries Director, James River Assembly of God, Ozark, MO)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an experience that is relevant, practical and much needed. I highly recommend this to anyone who journeys with kids and wants to see them grow closer to the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Todd Lowans, Director, Suburban Chicago
Youth for Christ, Chicago, IL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never found a theologically solid, engaging, and age-appropriate discipleship book that I can hand to new converts in my youth ministry - that they will actually want to read... Until now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Meghan Weber, Youth Pastor, Catonsville Assembly of God, Catonsville, MD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More believers would effectively disciple new believers if they had a practical tool they could use. &lt;em&gt;It All Starts Here&lt;/em&gt; is designed to be that effective tool that is engaging and easy to use for anyone desiring to help young believers grow in Christ. This resource could be the difference maker that could help your students grow and become Disciples of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Richard Crisco, President of Empowering Kingdom Leaders, International Speaker and Author, Pastor, Rochester First Assembly, Rochester, MI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;a strategic solution and an essential tool for any youth ministry looking to streamline students into well-rounded disciples of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Rob Gillen, Student Ministries Pastor, Harrisburg, PA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A must-have for ALL youth pastors looking to better disciple their students. A must-read for new believers wanting to know how to start the best journey of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Carrie Maurio, Youth pastor, Phoenixville, PA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;breaks down simple biblical truths into understandable and memorable daily readings to bring a student to a new level of understanding and spiritual growth. As a youth ministry veteran of over 15 years I&#39;m thrilled to see this resource be placed in the hands of today&#39;s generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Darren Hileman, Executive Director, South Carolina School of Leadership, Columbia, SC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world cries out to be discipled while Heaven commands us to make disciples. Sadly, we aren&#39;t sure how. This is a great resource to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Geoff Bassett, Education Professional in Asia, Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://light4asia.com/&quot;&gt;Light4Asia.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
