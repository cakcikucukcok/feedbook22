  <title>Our Father - Renee Noseworthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our Father is one persons journey of discovery into the Lords Prayer. You are invited to enter into your own journey of discovery of your heavenly Father and His love for you and for all of humankind. Scripture reveals to us that His desire for His children is overall restoration and wholeness. Through the Lords Prayer, Jesus taught us that we can ask our heavenly Father for every facet of that wholeness, and He encourages us to do just that.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Our Father, Renee Noseworthy discloses the Scriptures that have meant so much to her and shares her personal experience of how they have directed her ongoing path toward wholeness. Each petition of the Lords Prayer contains key elements of Gods nature that can guide you along that journey for yourself. Each chapter concludes with some very thought-provoking questions for personal or group study. Those questions are intended to highlight the attributes of God as our heavenly Father and how thoroughly He provides for the needs of those who are willing to trust Him.&lt;p&gt;
