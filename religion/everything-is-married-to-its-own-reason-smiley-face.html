  <title>Everything is  Married  to Its  Own Reason - Smiley Face</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An exciting account of my mother&amp;rsquo;s and my own exquisite voyages in Ukraine, Israel, and the United States while living in the depths of uncertainty and meager subsistence, mingling into deep circumstantial entanglements that both evoke pity and hysterical humor, enmeshed with classical cases of irony and satire. Mom and I were forced to fight against all odds and unexpected curveballs that life threw at us in every exotic country we immigrate into. We were faced with endless restlessness and perpetual yanking out of our comfort zone. Mother&amp;rsquo;s early decisions in my young life heavily affected my overall destiny. In the midst of chaos and confusion, both Mother and I reached a sense of some kind of orderliness and understanding in which we both learned to come to terms with our, typically speaking, dysfunctional lives. This is a story of vulnerability evolving into power, helplessness transforming into redemption, foolishness and the process of gaining wisdom through it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
