  <title>Who Says So? - Jim Bowden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jims second book, Who Says So seeks to maintain the integrity of the Scripture for its readers. During his practice of ministry, many church members as well as those outside the church frequently asked questions about the inspiration and authority of scripture. Many have indicated that they have heard ministers, especially those on television, declare that God is the author of the Bible and has conveyed every word penned by its many writers. That is the basis of their understanding of inspiration; therefore, the Bible must have absolute authority communicating what to believe and how to live or put into practice ones belief. In todays electronic mindset it would be like God using a smart phone and texting messages to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John to write concerning the teachings and practices of Jesus. 
In his practice of ministry Jim has helped church members and others see another perspective of inspiration and authority. In the quest to see that perspective he suggests read the scripture and let it speak for itself in reaching possible conclusions about inspiration and authority. When we allow the Bible to speak for itself in the context of the history of its development, we realize that the inspiring Spirit of God first touches the lives of its many authors and those bodies of believers who studied hundreds of manuscripts and finally favored 39 texts for the creation of the Old Testament and 27 texts for the New Testament. The spiritual presence of God also touches millions and millions of human beings as they read scripture or listen to a spoken message. In Jims book the focus of inspiration is not on the words of scripture but on the inspired storytellers central message. Also, there are many variances and some errors in many of the stories within the Bible. A storyteller is not dependent upon literary perfection to be inspired. If this were the case, we would not have the Bible today, so let the Bible speak for itself and be inspired and empowered by the spiritual presence of God and understand its message." />
