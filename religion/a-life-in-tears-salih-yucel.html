  <title>A Life in Tears - Salih Yucel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;  &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; &quot;&gt;Fethullah Gülen is a leading figure in the current Turkish socio-political context. Regardless of the impression different circles have about him, he is universally acknowledged as an accomplished scholar and independent thinker who has had &lt;em style=&quot; &quot;&gt;a life in tears&lt;/em&gt; dreaming of a “golden generation,” but also a life spent in persecution and ongoing trials. This book goes beyond the current controversy around his name, and tries to explore Gülen as a scholar around his certain personal traits and some of the key concepts he has been emphasizing over the years to mobilize his audience. Based on a research that covers over seventy books, 564 sermons, over 500 talks by Gülen, more than fifty interviews of his close associates and friends aired on TV networks, and the author&#39;s personal observations, this book is a useful reference for those who study scholarly traditions of Islam in general and Fethullah Gülen in particular.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
