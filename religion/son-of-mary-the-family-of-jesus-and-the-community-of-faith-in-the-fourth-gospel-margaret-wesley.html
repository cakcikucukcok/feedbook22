  <title>Son of Mary: The Family of Jesus and the Community of Faith in the Fourth Gospel - Margaret Wesley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Son of Mary offers new solutions to some persistent exegetical problems in the interpretation of three of the most puzzling passages in the Gospel of John, and does so in a way that illuminates the social-cultural context to the New Testament world. Old Testament resonances are heard here afresh: The miracle at Cana is seen in the light of God&#39;s people living without the wine of God&#39;s blessing, and Jesus&#39; interaction with his brothers is placed alongside the story of Joseph.   Margaret Wesley explores the world of kinship relationships in First Century Palestine, discovering how an understanding of family expectations and obligations can illuminate Jesus&#39; words and actions and guide our relationships within the church as sisters and brothers of one another and as daughters and sons of God. The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus are understood in a fresh way as the creation of a new family.   Margaret demonstrates a mastery of current research while drawing on a wide range of primary patristic sources. She shows a respectful yet firm and assertive spirit when dealing with controversy." />
