  <title>The Spirit of Revival: Christian Revivals - Ewang Nelson Mfortaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In these last days, the Christian Faith has fallen into apostasy as it is rightly written in 1 Timothy 4:1-2(NIV), The Spirit clearly says in the later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. We all await a Christian revival but before true revival comes, there must first be a rebirth of learning. This book is a body of living words that make up flames of revival; it is the re -awakening of the Christian Faith. It will enlighten your understanding of God&#39;s mind and will. Therefore pay full attention to its contents (Proverbs 4:20, NIV) because understanding it will give you real understanding of the Christian Faith. If you understand this book then the Bible will become plain to you because it is its language. The Spirit of Revival is written to make all the mysteries of the Bible (including the mysteries of the Garden of Eden, the nature of Faith, the concept of sin, and the miracle of baptism) plain and simple to you.  These words are not his, but those of Christ. They are spirits ( life) and seven times pure: When there is a need for revival, and the spirit of meditation falls on a man he does not just start preaching (or teaching), but the Spirit raises his understanding of the Truth, it may take years for him to be ready, that is why there is a period in the life of Christ that is not mentioned in the gospels but it is summarized as, &quot;And Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature, and in the favor of the Lord and man&quot; (Luke 2:52,NIV).  And when such a man has become perfect in wisdom and judgments such that he walk not by sight nor reprove after his hearing because he can discern between spirits (wisdoms), he is presented to man for the glory of the Spirit that leads him. The words in this book are sure and greater than all insights." />
