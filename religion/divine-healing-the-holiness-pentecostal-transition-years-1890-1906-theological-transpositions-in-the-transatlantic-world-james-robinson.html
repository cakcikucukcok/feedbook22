  <title>Divine Healing: The Holiness-Pentecostal Transition Years, 1890-1906: Theological Transpositions in the Transatlantic World - James Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the present volume, James Robinson shows how the Holiness movement contributed to the rise of Pentecostalism, with emphasis on those sectors that practiced divine healing. Although other scholars have undertaken to explore this story, Robinson&#39;s treatment is by far the most thorough examination to date. He draws productively on the burgeoning secondary literatures on Pentecostalism and healing, and brings to light frequently overlooked, yet revealing primary sources. The events narrated are fascinating in their own right, and are important to the histories of Pentecostalism and healing for how they clarify the processes by which divine healing was pursued, debated, and often disparaged. The text also contributes to larger medical and social histories, offering tantalizing glimpses of the roots of some of today&#39;s most popular and contested medical and religious responses to sickness and health." />
