  <title>My Journey Down the Reincarnation Highway - Frank Mares</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this personal account, one man details how he discovered the fact of reincarnation and explores what he did in his prior lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More people than you would believe have prior life memories. In his new spiritual memoir My Journey down the Reincarnation Highway: The True Story of a Man who found nine of His Past Lives author and businessman Frank Mares tells how he acquired psychic ability in his middle age. With this new gift, he recovered facts about nine of his prior lives, most of which involved violent, bloody deaths. The most recent life was that of a young German Wehrmacht sergeant who was ambushed and killed by Russians during the night of May 1, 1944 in a dark Estonian  farmhouse. Not being satisfied with just discovering his past lives, Mares goes on a spiritual mission to find out why he kept dying violently. The answers do not come easily, but by using a team of three world class psychics he eventually tracks down the shocking reason for all his brutal deaths. The psychic team finds that within the soul of this normal small businessman resides a brutal, stone cold killer from the 1600s who surprisingly was the revered founder of a gentile noble family.&lt;/p.
&lt;p&gt;As part of his souls continuing quest for redemption, Mares hopes to salvage the dark time in his souls past into something that could help others today. His experiences show that death is only a transition phase, and that it should not be feared. His book also reveals that reincarnation is actually a well designed, organized system that allows souls to learn personalized life lessons over a surprising number of lives. If you read this book, you will never look at life (and death) in the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
