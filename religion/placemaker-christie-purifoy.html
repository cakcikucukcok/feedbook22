  <title>Placemaker - Christie Purifoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Images of comfortable kitchens and flower-filled gardens stir something deep within us--we instinctively long for home. In a world of chaos and conflict, we want a place of comfort and peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Placemaker, &lt;/em&gt;Christie Purifoy invites us to notice our soul&#39;s desire for beauty, our need to create and to be created again and again. As she reflects on the joys and sorrows of two decades as a placemaker and her recent years living in and restoring a Pennsylvania farmhouse, Christie shows us that we are all gardeners. No matter our vocation, we spend much of our lives tending, keeping, and caring. In each act of creation, we reflect the image of God. In each moment of making beauty, we realize that beauty is a mystery to receive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaving together her family&#39;s journey with stories of botanical marvels and the histories of the flawed yet inspiring placemakers who shaped the land generations ago, Christie calls us to cultivate orchards and communities, to clap our hands along with the trees of the fields. &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;lacemaker&lt;/em&gt; is a timely yet timeless reminder that the cultivation of good and beautiful places is not a retreat from the real world but a holy pursuit of a world that is more real than we know. A call to tend the soul, the land, and the places we share with one another. A reminder that we are always headed home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
