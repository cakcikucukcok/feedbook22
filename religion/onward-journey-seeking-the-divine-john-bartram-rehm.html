  <title>Onward Journey: Seeking the Divine - John Bartram Rehm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In my continuing spiritual journey I have become increasingly convinced of two truths: first, that each individual has the capacity to be touched by the divine and thereby to be made whole; second, that the combination of reason and materialism are literally destroying the world and its creatures, human and otherwise. This little book is implicitly a plea for the reinstitution of love and peace-as opposed to hatred and war-as the animating principles of life. Perhaps you will find your own search for the divine reflected in it. -from the Prologue.  Over the course of a long, rich life and legal career, John Rehm realizes there is much more meaning-and joy and pain-than mere reason can convey. Attentive to the variety of his peak experiences and glimpses of the divine, Rehm discovers a renewed love of and trust in life: the more he acknowledges its polarities and mystery, the more he understands. Simple couplets describe the life of Jesus, torturous poems reflect lives of the saints, and charming fables give us closely observed glimpses of the freedom that often only comes with age. Rehm&#39;s words and truth telling transport us on our own onward journey of seeking the Divine." />
