  <title>Losing My Religion - William Lobdell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;William Lobdell&#39;s journey of faith&amp;#8212;and doubt&amp;#8212;may be the most compelling spiritual memoir of our time. Lobdell became a born-again Christian in his late 20s when personal problems&amp;#8212;including a failed marriage&amp;#8212;drove him to his knees in prayer. As a newly minted evangelical, Lobdell&amp;#8212;a veteran journalist&amp;#8212;noticed that religion wasn&#39;t covered well in the mainstream media, and he prayed for the Lord to put him on the religion beat at a major newspaper. In 1998, his prayers were answered when the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; asked him to write about faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet what happened over the next eight years was a roller-coaster of inspiration, confusion, doubt, and soul-searching as his reporting and experiences slowly chipped away at his faith. While reporting on hundreds of stories, he witnessed a disturbing gap between the tenets of various religions and the behaviors of the faithful and their leaders. He investigated religious institutions that acted less ethically than corrupt Wall St. firms. He found few differences between the morals of Christians and atheists. As this evidence piled up, he started to fear that God didn&#39;t exist. He explored every doubt, every question&amp;#8212;until, finally, his faith collapsed. After the paper agreed to reassign him, he wrote a personal essay in the summer of 2007 that became an international sensation for its honest exploration of doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Losing My Religion&lt;/em&gt; is a book about life&#39;s deepest questions that speaks to everyone: Lobdell understands the longings and satisfactions of the faithful, as well as the unrelenting power of doubt. How he faced that power, and wrestled with it, is must reading for people of faith and nonbelievers alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
