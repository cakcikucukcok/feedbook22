  <title>Just Along for the Ride - Martha Roddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the age of forty-six, Bill Roddy, a vibrant and magnetic man, was diagnosed with colon cancer. His diagnosis pierced the heart of his mother - twice diagnosed with possible colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just Along for the Ride is a beautiful story of a mother and sons love for each other and the love of both for Christ. The sufficiency of Gods grace in the most difficult time of life is an eternal truth experienced in a fresh and new way in the lives of these two beautiful people. You will be overwhelmingly blessed as you make the journey with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Dr. John Bisagno, Pastor Emeritus Houstons First Baptist Church, Speaker and Author&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can benefit from reading about the all-too-brief life of Bill Roddy. It is at once inspiring, heartwarming, and humorous. Bills story is a road map for anyone who desires to both give and receive the utmost from this life and, more importantly, throughout eternity. It would be a meaningful addition to any library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Robert E. Driver, PhD Professor of Finance and Ethics LeTourneau University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASCAR is a sport that rises and grows stronger in the face of adversity. This is the character of the sport, and it is merely a reflection of the character of its fansand Bill is a perfect example. Faced with adversity, he chooses to move forward in life with faith, hope, and love. His story as told by his mother will awaken within us all a desire to face challenges as Bill did determined, focused and confident that God is in control. Those of us who are involved in NASCAR know the fans of this sport are what make it great and Bill is one of the greatest!&lt;/p&gt;
