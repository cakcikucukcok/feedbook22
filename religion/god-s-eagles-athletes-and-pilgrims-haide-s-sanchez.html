  <title>God’S Eagles, Athletes and Pilgrims - Haide S. Sanchez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. 
They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary; 
they will walk and not be faint. (Isaiah 40v31, NIV) 
You were created to be an eagle soaring with divine revelation, an athlete running races for God, and a pilgrim walking this earth on your way to a glorious future. This weekly devotional based on Isaiah 40v31explores what it means to be Gods eagle, athlete and pilgrim and interweaves with this theme the stories and testimonies of people with diverse backgrounds and from different countries. This book will inspire, encourage, exhort and teach you to view your circumstances and to live your life from a Biblical perspective. 
This is a fine collection of real peoples stories; their challenges, their successes and their failures, and ultimately their encounters with a gracious, powerful God who has an incredible plan for each one of us. Haide Sanchez intertwines the stories with scriptural insights and challenges in a masterful way. A serious weekly devotional that will inspire the reader to truly soar, run and walk with God.

This is a beautifully constructed book, with detailed and well-researched scriptural references. I believe it will be a blessing and an inspiration to the reader, and will be instrumental in bringing many closer to God. 
 Mire Byrne, Dublin, Ireland (proof-reader and blog site moderator) 
This book is awesome, insightful and timely. It is one of the most interesting devotional books I have ever read especially because of the stories or testimonies of real people of our decade from a wide swathe of nations and Christian denominations. The one per week devotion is very helpful to busy people for reflection and personal application.
