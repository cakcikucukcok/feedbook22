  <title>Trust and Obey: Man’S Part in Joining God’S Family - Ken Nissen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How can it be? How can salvation be Gods gift of grace through faith and not by works; yet there are tons of Bible verses that connect eternal life directly to obedience and faithfulness? It was a great aid to me to see how both are given, and they do not conflict at all. I have written several papers to show this, and they have been helpful to a number of people. So I am enclosing these into a book form. Each paper shows in various ways how both the faith and obedience verses are valid and precious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Scripture very good I agree with everything in it I dont think we will ever fully know Gods part and our part, but this is the closest I have ever seen  It is the best bridge I have seen I feel it is a unique and much needed contribution. (concerning Paradox).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robertson McQuilkin, president emeritus of Columbia International University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very thought-provoking! Ive been aware of this Paradox, but having it presented like this highlights the grace-works elements in our faith which must be confronted. It also broadens ones appreciation for the Word. (concerning Paradox).&lt;/p&gt;
