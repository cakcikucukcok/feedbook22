  <title>Bruised and Wounded - Ronald Rolheiser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The New York Times bestselling author of The Holy Longing turns his attention to one of the stigmas of our time.
“Unique insights on the nature of suicide, its devastating effects, and God’s embracing love throughout. Fr. Ron is exactly who I would have wanted at my side when my daughter died.” 
—Marjorie Antus, author of My Daughter, Her Suicide, and God: A Memoir of Hope
“Don’t let the size of this book fool you into thinking it doesn’t have much to say about suicide. Each page—each sentence—is rich in insight, wisdom, compassion, and most of all, comfort. Ronald Rolheiser gently dismantles the age-old myths and taboos associated with suicide, and gives brokenhearted survivors of suicide loss genuine reasons for hope.”
—Kay Warren, cofounder of Saddleback Church, Lake Forest, California
A new way of understanding death by suicide with chapters on
• Removing the Taboo
• Despair as Weakness rather than Sin
• Reclaiming the Memory of our Loved One
Ronald Rolheiser is a Catholic priest, internationally renowned speaker and spiritual writer whose books appeal to Christians of all backgrounds and spiritual seekers of all kinds. He is the author of several books and the award-winning weekly column “In Exile” carried by more than seventy newspapers worldwide.
“Ronald Rolheiser&#39;s books have changed my life. This one will do the same for many readers desperate for mercy, understanding, and the love of God.” 
— James Martin, SJ, author of Jesus: A Pilgrimage" />
