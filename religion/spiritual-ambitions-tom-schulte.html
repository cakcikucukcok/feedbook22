  <title>Spiritual Ambitions - Tom Schulte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our ambitions determine the kind of person we become, and the kind of person we become determines what we will do in life. And since what we do in life can have lastingeven eternalresults, its no surprise that many of us strive to reach our ambitions. Yet while we can be consumed with pursuing worldly, secular ambitions for career and family, our spiritual ambitions are too often left to chance as we drift through life. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spiritual Ambitions: How Rich Do You Want to Be in Eternity? challenges us to identify our spiritual ambitions and evaluate their genuine importance to our lives. Whether you want to start a ministry, become a pastor, or just be more mindful of Gods presence in your life, author Tom Schulte shows you how to set your ambitions and listen for Gods guidance to follow the path he sets out before you. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To be used by God to fulfill his purpose is the greatest reward and victory we can have as Christians, but first we must be the kind of person who is pleasing to God. Therefore, we must develop our spiritual ambitions and make them our priority in life, proving to ourselves and to God that we are receptive and ready to heed the call and be touched by Gods Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
