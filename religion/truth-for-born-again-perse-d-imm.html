  <title>Truth for Born-Again - Perse D. Imm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Heaven and Hell are futuristic, not currently real, but men&amp;#39;s spirits, religion, fear, born-again and heavenly joy are. Men&amp;#39;s spirits are dead. That&amp;#39;s why men in general cannot have any realistic spiritual understandings and easily devoured by religion. They are born into this world physically, carrying the corpses of spirits. That&amp;#39;s also why all men have fear. Fear is the smell of a spirit-corpse. Men of fear, religion and the knowledge of good and evil are not qualified to be in Paradise Regained, but are destined to be thrown into the Hell-fire; the final cleaning step of re-creation. To be freed from fear, religion and the ominous knowledge of good and evil, men must be born-again. It&amp;#39;s the only task that all men must have it realized during their life time. It&amp;#39;s not the task of men, but God-Almighty&amp;#39;s that should be accomplished and realized, never by men&amp;#39;s efforts, but totally by God the Father&amp;#39;s. Born-again is never man&amp;#39;s work, never religious. Man, not as animal-kind, cannot die individually. All men had died, as a whole, at the first death, and will die again at the second universal event of death at the end of human history. Genuine life and death, having nothing to do with existence, are spiritual, not physical as with animals. Man will exist forever either dead or alive. God desires to make all men be born-again with their revived spirits to be qualified for His newly created Kingdom. For God to make a man born-again, man needs to know some basic historical information to be motivated for His re-creation. All natural men, spiritually-dead, are just &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;. God needs &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39; for His new creation of man; not living-dust, which is improbable, but just dead &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;. God gave Adam the life, which was spiritual and genuine. But Satan, in the body of a serpent, gave him the knowledge of good and evil. There&amp;#39;s something that men must give up to acquire the eternal life, that is, the Satanic knowledge of good and evil, not to speak of all its applications. All religious merits must be denied totally, which are nothing else but the Tower of Babel designed and being built by men based on the Satanic knowledge of good and evil. The Truth that all men must know to be freed by from &amp;#39;fear of death&amp;#39; is hidden in the jungle of thoughts and history in the Bible.&lt;br&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;This book is a book of challenge; the challenge of God the Father, the perfect irresistible almighty Love. It&amp;#39;ll show whether the Heavenly gate is really open wide or not, and guide any sincere and honest reader to be led into the grasp of the expecting Spirit of the Father who has gone crazy for re-gaining His Own back into His possession from the tenacious grasp of the Serpent; the roaring lion.&lt;br&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;TITLES: Philosophy, religion, science and logic; Existentialism and Cross; Philosophy of Jesus; The core, the secret of the Bible; The knowledge of good and evil-the shackle; Conquering death; Universal event of the Cross; Contents of faith; Miss-application of &amp;#39;faith without works&amp;#39;; What is the will of God; Possessing or living; Absurdity of keeping the Law; Freedom to sin; Weakness of God; Adam and Jesus; Judas Iscariot the Jew; Repentance-denial of the knowledge of good and evil; Citizenship of His Kingdom; War of reasoning; Words of revival." />
