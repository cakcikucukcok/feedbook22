  <title>Scooch! - Jaya the Trust Coach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scooch!&lt;/em&gt; offers a kinder, gentler process of personal growth and healing: point yourself roughly in the right direction and inch that way&amp;mdash;no need to map out the whole journey. This spiritual, many-paths-friendly approach offers workable support in practicing presence and nonresistance; following inner guidance; and declaring a grand experiment to live in a friendly Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1, &amp;ldquo;Scooch in Closer to Your Pain and Suffering,&amp;rdquo; posits pain as no problem. It guides you to treat feelings and thoughts separately: mind the pain body, tend the mind (including through The Work of Byron Katie). What if you neither ran from pain nor perpetuated your own suffering? Detaching from particular timelines or outcomes, effectively scooch into just plain feeling better and into navigating by joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2, &amp;ldquo;Scooch in Closer to Yourself&amp;rdquo; offers tips in minding your relationship with yourself with supreme self-honoring. Drop comparisons; replace guilt and shame with lavish self-forgiveness; harness your power of interpretation to hold a winning stance. Here&amp;#39;s your ticket to the end of self-abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 3, &amp;ldquo;Scooch into Your Personal Power,&amp;rdquo; advocates not power-over, but the power to be your biggest, most beautiful self. Cultivate a consciousness of choice over victim mentality, using language to support this. Tell the truth, freely answer yes or no, practice self-referral instead of looking outward for validation. The power zappers&amp;mdash;gems showing typical ways you dilute your power&amp;mdash;come with practical instructions on kindly course-correcting toward a more powerful expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 4, &amp;ldquo;Your Power to Create: Scooch from Vision to Fruition,&amp;rdquo; turns such abused words as &lt;em&gt;visioning&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;manifesting&lt;/em&gt; on their heads. This pragmatic, no-bullshit approach invites you to craft clear intentions and &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt; toward them, while holding anything you want&amp;mdash;any vision you&amp;#39;ve got&amp;mdash;with a loose grip. As you move, trust open and shut doors equally, seeing both as guidance. Let life show you: the gifts may be in the journey, not the outcome. The gift may be in a redirection you couldn&amp;#39;t have fathomed. Scooching into a friendly Universe means playing with trust that life will get you where you need to go.&lt;/p&gt;" />
