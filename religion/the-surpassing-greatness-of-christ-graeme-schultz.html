  <title>The Surpassing Greatness Of Christ - Graeme Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My intention in writing this book has been to &amp;lsquo;express the in-expressible&amp;rsquo;, the most astonishing spectacle ever presented to humanity &amp;ndash; the surpassing greatness of Christ.&lt;br /&gt;
Christianity is not primarily about the programs, activities and causes of church life, it is about the union that Jesus re-built between us and God. I spent the better part of my life deeply involved in the organization that represents the Lord of Glory, but the busyness of church life had a way of filtering out the magnificence of what I was actually in. I participated in the whole thing - except for the thing that matters most; the inexpressible wonder of knowing Christ Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;
Now at last I know what I was missing, so I invite you to come on a journey with me into Christ. Not so that we can be better equipped for ministry, or more successful in our area of service &amp;ndash; but because he is the lover of our souls, and he wants us to sit still and let him love us.&lt;br /&gt;
I have deliberately written in a way that is more conversational than instructional. My intention in this conversation is not to tell you how to think or believe; only you can do that.&lt;br /&gt;
But I am certain that once Jesus has been seen for who he really is, it will render you speechless too &amp;ndash; unable to describe the indescribable&amp;hellip; and you will be profoundly changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
