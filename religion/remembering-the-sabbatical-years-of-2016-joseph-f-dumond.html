  <title>Remembering the Sabbatical Years of 2016 - Joseph F. Dumond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Remembering the Sabbatical years of 2016, was written as simply as possible to explain how anyone could prove fro their own Bibles when the Sabbatical and Jubilee Years are.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Having written The Prophecies of Abraham in 2010, many people struggled to understand the chronology, which is crucial in order to know precisely where we are in these last days now. Because so many struggled we wrote Remembering the Sabbatical years of 2016 so that even an 8 year old could then explain it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Remembering the Sabbatical year of 2016 shows you all the known biblical, historical and artifacts that mention the Sabbatical years. Then we show you how they all line up with each other and from that you can count down to our time now. We also show you where the Sabbatical years were derailed in history and taken away from the proper time of observing them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Once you have read this book and proven these facts for yourself, then you will understand we are in the 120th Jubilee cycle. Then once you see the curses that have been set out in a specific order of events, the nightly news becomes surreal as you can then see these curses happening on the news.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Order you copy of Remembering the Sabbatical year of 2016 today and begin to understand these last days unlike anyone else ever has.
&lt;/p&gt;
