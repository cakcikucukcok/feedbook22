  <title>Trouble Don&#39;t Last Always - The Reverend Deacon Shelby M. Friend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Trouble Don&#39;t Last Always is the story of an African American Viet Nam Veteran, now a permanent deacon in the Roman Catholic Church, and how through the grace of God and with the support of his family, friends, and church community, he survived the difficulties and hardships that life gave him and his family. This book tells how he weathered the storms and troubled times that war, poverty, sickness, racism, and the death of his father brought into his life. It is a timely story of hope and inspiration for everyone, but especially targets those who feel that they have nowhere to turn in times of trouble.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;His journey from Greeneville, Tennessee, to Cleveland, Ohio with a stopover in Vietnam is a story of how troubles and hard times can be diverted or changed when we take responsibility for our actions and let God into our lives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Reverend Deacon Friend believes that the words of wisdom from his parents as well as his own sense of enlightenment upon his consecration in the Catholic Church are important words for readers to hear. The Reverend Deacon Friend is a Vietnam veteran who is in a master&#39;s degree program at Ursuline College, Pepper Pike, OH, and is a deacon at Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Cleveland, OH.&lt;/P&gt;
