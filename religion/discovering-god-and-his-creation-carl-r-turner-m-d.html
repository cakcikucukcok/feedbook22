  <title>Discovering God and His Creation - Carl R. Turner M.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Is there evidence for the existence of God? Is evolution true and if so, is evolution compatible with Christianity? These questions face not only students each year but also our modern society as a whole. The answers to these questions are important because they will determine our understanding of nature and our relationship with God. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dr. Turner in his book, &lt;I&gt;Discovering God and His Creation&lt;/I&gt;, focuses on these two questions. He tells of his lifelong journey in the worlds of faith, science and evolution and what he has discovered as he searched for answers. He outlines the overwhelming evidence for both the existence of God and evolution and explains how nature cannot be understood without evolution. He reveals that the solution to the faith and science dilemma lies in a deeper understanding of the Christian belief that God is a father.
 &lt;P&gt;Dr. Turner&#39;s journey began with the influence of a father and, after completion of graduate studies in evolutionary biology and medical school, ended with his realization that evolution is more compatible with Christianity than any other explanation for nature. The reasons behind Dr. Turner&#39;s conclusion are enlightening and will provide a long sought for answer to the standoff between faith and science. &lt;/P&gt;" />
