  <title>Suffering and Grieving - Reverend Shirley A. Browne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt; This book is a must read! It has been a journey of the heart for my wife. It was not just a quest for answers and inspiration for others, she was also looking to find strength through some of her own life situations. A great deal of love went into these pages Read this book, and I truly believe it will help you get through the tough times!&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; Jon Alton Browne&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; As someone who has faced the loss of loved ones, I know how the pain of death can affect you. When you lose someone close to you it seems as if God has abandoned you, or is punishing you. That is far from the truth. Gods love for us runs so deep that He uses death as a way to draw us closer to Him. I feel that this body of work does a great job of illustrating how we can deal with death by leaning on our faith in God. This book has helped me and Im sure it will help millions of others deal with their time of bereavement.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; Sherwin Jamal Murray&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; This writing has inspired me to be strong when I am going through lifes difficulties. I know that I am blessed to have you as my mother, and I thank God for the love that you freely give to others, and for your obedience in completing
this work. I Love You!&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; Andria Nicole Bailey&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; These seeds of encouragement came about through my observation of ordinary people going through diffi cult times, in need of an extraordinary view of life. TRUST GOD!!!&lt;br&gt;" />
