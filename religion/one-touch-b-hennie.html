  <title>One Touch - B. Hennie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It wasnt until I began to write this book that the Lord would begin to reveal everything to me.  He was pulling a yes from my spirit, but I would have to go through this process for him to develop me before he could use me to help someone else.  I knew I was being led by the Holy Spirit, but my flesh, my mind, had to catch up with my spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the process where you have surrendered your will to his will, the Lord has dug deep down in you and taken out of you all that is not like him.  Then he can impart himself in you.  His Spirit is in control; no longer the works of your flesh.  He has empowered you to do his will.  Now you can receive the blessings the Lord has promised you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember many years ago when the Lord spoke these words into my spirit: After you have suffered awhile, I will restore, strengthen and keep you (1 Peter 5:10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I didnt know that it would be years later that I would have to go through sickness, pain, and suffering. Through this process, he was preparing me for my healing ministry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
