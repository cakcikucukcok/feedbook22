Stories that will be covered include Widow&#39;s Mite, Rich Young Ruler, Destruction of the Temple, Searching for the Lost Coin, Sower of the Seeds, Transfiguration, and the Great Commission.   This book will flip the script of many Bible stories, allowing us to hear Jesus&#39; call to change as one that is directed at us rather than as one we should direct toward others." />
