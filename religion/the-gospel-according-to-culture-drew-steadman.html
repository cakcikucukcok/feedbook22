  <title>The Gospel According to Culture - Drew Steadman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our nation is experiencing a clash of worldviews. You may not have thought of it in those terms, but you&amp;#39;ve probably felt it. As a result, we don&amp;#39;t just disagree on the issues, but on the fundamental worldview shaping the issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cultural Christianity&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;shaped our worldview for centuries. This perspective taught us to behave according to God&amp;#39;s commands, or at least to look like it. Many are still influenced by this worldview, which urges us to return to a particular way of living. Increasingly, these calls fall on deaf ears, and for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secular Humanism&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;now shapes our nation. This belief system encourages us to be true to ourselves and good to others. This mode of thinking has become our culture&amp;#39;s default and probably affects you more than you realize&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultural Christianity and Humanism appear to be opposites, but they share a common thread: our ability to do good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message of Jesus, however, is different. He teaches that we can&amp;#39;t&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;keep God&amp;#39;s standards by our own efforts. We&amp;#39;re inherently flawed, which means that being true to ourselves often leads to hurting others. The Gospel is a proclamation of grace, one that transforms us from the inside out and frees us to love others sacrificially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pause and reflect: How does&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;the gospel according to culture&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;influence us compared to the Gospel of Jesus? Only one has the power to transform. Dive in and let&amp;#39;s rediscover the grace of God together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
