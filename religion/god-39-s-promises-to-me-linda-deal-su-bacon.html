&lt;p&gt;Gods Promises to Me is one month of Gods Word to be repeated every month for one year. Each day will have one of Gods promises with words to believe and a prayer. There is also a space for you or your child to journal. They can record their thoughts, joys, concerns or prayer requests. They will then be able to look back at their journal and see how God keeps His promises and He is always with them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By reading and journaling Gods Promises to Me for one year, their faith will have a strong foundation and defense when going out into their world. It is through God&#39;s Word that parents can teach their children that God is always with them, and they are never alone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
