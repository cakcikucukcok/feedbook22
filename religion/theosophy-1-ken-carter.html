  <title>Theosophy 1 - Ken Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have watched and followed religion all my life and a summary will never happen it seems. My efforts have both opened and closed doors in light and darkness and fortunately the light never goes away. Once a lesson or point is understood it serves as a beacon during the worst times. When I decided to accept Gods words as truth and tried living them, His commandments became easier and troubles are now few and understood. 
The doctrines of men that Jesus Christ refused stand in the way of our getting to know God on a more personalized experience. God created men and awe with reverence is expected but what we have are just various forms of religion. Most fade away as time passes. Jesus was taught from the Torah. The laws and the prophets was his mainstay but he declared a change had to take place. 
Many modern religions no longer accept what is known as the old Testament while the new Testament plainly states that &quot;All scripture is inspired by God and beneficial&quot;. It is the work of men that demands decision about religion. Its the reason I love the idea of tolerance. It is necessary to make way for tearing down walls that divide us and at the same time it urges us not to be misled by false prophets and teachings. I went through turmoil and stress while writing this book as spirits both of light and the dark bared reasons and insight. True students of bible may find themselves listening while people who just listen may get offended. 
In all our dealings with God and men, there are differences due to upbringing and cognitive natures. Most of what we know and understand has been handed down and accepted without question or search. This book offers a reminder that we should examine what we are told closely, since pure worship is needed if everlasting life is the goal. Upon finding out what is truth or not, it is our duty as people to find the acceptable way that constitutes pure worship. They can&#39;t all be right with God and he does hold us responsible, plus we will be held accountable. Like the laws of the lands, ignorance has no place. Its a fact. God does have rules. 
Gods Holy Spirit decides what is revealed, gained, or destroyed throughout all the times of our experience and existence. Minds can be opened and closed, depending on his purposes. He may use any of his creations as he chooses to complete any task or goal. 
I prayed and asked him to let me serve him. It has not stopped. You may be surprised if you knew the changes that I have been through since I started working. Life&#39;s problems do not go away but they are much easier to understand and manage because answers and solutions are normally used to conquer in the physical world and space we occupy. Nothing happens right or wrong without us making steps in those directions while taking Gods warnings and words seriously. Isaiah 45:7 tells us this. 
The spiritual sense and form we hope for has made confusion a master of men. Jesus is the closest example for Christians and all the other religions of the world have their own. Righteousness, I think, is what God looks for in a person. You should know that obedience leads the way to it. Thank you for reading." />
