  <title>Faith to Conceive - Michelle D. Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faith to Conceive is a book about the challenges my husband and I have encountered in trying to conceive a child. Although everybodys story is different, Gods unmovable, unshakeable love remains the same. My prayer is that my journey would encourage, motivate, and inspire women and couples to trust in God to conceive.
The story of Hannah is an excellent example of Faith in action! This book takes you through my journey and goes deeper into the life of Hannah and her faith to conceive a son who became a leader in the nation of Israel and a prophet of God. Since God shows no partiality, I know he would do the same for you. Stir up your faith today and allow God to have his way in every area of your life.
As a woman, there are internal and external pressures for us to fulfill the very essence of our womanhood, and that is to give birthbirth to dreams and visions, and mostly, birth to life. There are circumstances that we face that sets a tone of discouragement, despair, and defeat, which we are tempted to speak when our heart-filled desires do not happen as we expect. We all face it in some area and time of our lives, but it is in how we respond that determines our outcomes. Michelle Joseph, a woman who endured the mountaintops and valleys, even the desert, expressly shares her journey to conceive. Michelle takes you through her struggle to live and to love, the battle to remain hopeful, and most of all, the trying of her faith to trust God at his will, way, and word. As you turn the pages, Michelle shares her emotions, cry to God, and prayers. Her hope is that you will be encouraged to stand on the promises of God and not lose hope for your desire to come through, knowing that God loves you and he is with you and for you (Minister Simone Rawlins)." />
