  <title>Radical Islam Wins - Joe Oblack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of what may happen in any country of the world! In this case, when ethics of old fade and the United States of America allows more and more government to support more and more people, the once-stable economy fails, which allows radical Islam to plant the seeds and eventually succeed in establishing an Islamic State.&amp;nbsp; Our democratic republic&amp;rsquo;s president is replaced with a caliph who rules under the strict code of Shariah (Islamic Law).&amp;nbsp; Islamic fundamentalism takes over, and America, the once economic and military power of the world, becomes part of the new Islamic world order. It is a reality that should be explored because it could be our future. Many in our great nation refuse to believe Shariah represents a threat to us or that radical Islam plans to change our way of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Can radical Islam replace our Constitution with Shariah? Again, many in our country say no, but think about this. When Adolph Hitler walked into the Socialist German Workers&amp;rsquo; Party, he became a member of that small organization. Fourteen years later he was chancellor of the Nazi party that ruled Germany. The peaceful and silent majority of Germany were irrelevant!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Following the fictional beginning, the rest of this book includes an easy-to-read and concise history and description of the tenets of Islam, as well as how radical Islam uses these beliefs to threaten the population of the world. Some of the subjects covered include Shariah, Jihad, Jew Hatred, Dhimmitude, Blasphemy Laws and the Muslim Brotherhood. Today, according to PEW research, there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world. Most of these Muslims are peaceful law abiding citizens leading normal family life.&amp;nbsp; Only a small percentage of radical Islamists make up the group that spreads terrorism around the world. They, however, make everyone suffer, including other Muslims. If this small percentage of radicals who kill, pillage, and wish to overthrow governments is only one-tenth of a percent of all Muslims, that is still almost 1.6 million enemies of the rest of the world population including other Muslims. To survive in a civilization of your choosing, it is necessary to know your enemy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
