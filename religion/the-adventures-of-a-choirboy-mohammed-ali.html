  <title>The Adventures of a Choirboy - Mohammed Ali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adventures of a Choirboy is a detailed account of Mohammed Alis Out-of-Body Experience (OBE). As a teenager, Alis adventures took him into the spiritual realm or the world of the spirit  as some call it.
OBE is a situation in which a persons spirit (the inner man), moves temporarily out of his or her physical body, the same way an astronaut striped off his space suit would stand beside his empty suit.
OBE was a rare and strange phenomenon, so Ali kept this experience to himself, until he discovered through books that: OBE is a universal subject, although, some consider it a purely spiritual phenomenon; some aspects of it (OBE) has been scientifically proven through experiments. 
Prominent amongst the books are Kenneth E Hagins The Threefold Nature Of Man and Perry Stones Secrets from Beyond the Grave. Much later, Ali was introduced by TL Lizzy to EA Adeboyes Abundant Life After Death; Open Heavens Daily Devotionals of 26th February 2016 and Kenneth E Hagins I Believe in Visions.
In this compelling book, Ali recounts for the first time his adventures out of his physical body. This true life story also provides answers to some unvoiced inquiries that only a few would ask their Rabbis, Pastors, Imams or Spiritual Mentors. Such as: Is the inner man a myth or a reality?  How does human spirit look like?  How is the world of the spirit look like?  What is OBE and what do our scriptures say about it?  mohammedalibooks@gmail.com

The Adventures of a Choirboy rekindles memories of our teenage choir days.

To keep warm and awake during the cold windy nigh; we enjoyed hot tea and breads. We were young, healthy, adventurous and reverenced God. IOB Donald." />
