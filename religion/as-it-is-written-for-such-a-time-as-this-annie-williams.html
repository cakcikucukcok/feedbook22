  <title>As It Is Written . . . for Such a Time as This - Annie Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like ancient Israel, America has forsaken God and gone its own way. In this books Scriptures and prayers, a merciful God issues a clarion call and provides a clear roadmap for us to return. Truly, for such a time as this.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Paul Terry, pastor of Faith Presbyterian Church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Annie Williams prayer partner and friend for over twenty years, Ive had the delight of experiencing the distinctive way the Lord speaks His perfect Word into Annie at just the right time for the benefit and blessing of others. Whether during an important church board decision, a healing/intercessory prayer assignment, or in the everyday things of life, the Lord has gifted Annie with truly hearing His Voice. As It Is Written  For Such a Time as This is a unique book straight from the Fathers heart and mind into yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Nancy Henkes, prayer partner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annie Williams is a remarkable woman of God: a healer, a reconciler, a witness to the power and grace of Jesus Christ. I have seen her grow over many years from a rank and file member of the Church into a potent leader with pastoral and prophetic gifts who has heard and obeyed Gods call to speak his Word to our nations leaders. The Scriptures she has heard God speaking to our nation are right on target for such a time as this.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Dave Philips&lt;/p&gt;" />
