      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Signposts on the Road to Forgiveness is a book about forgiveness and so much more. Its a call to come to the spiritual place for which you were born. Its a call to a deeper relationship with the Lord.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten chapters lay a scriptural foundation concerning the plan God has had for you from the beginning. Twenty signposts then give scriptural directives to help you make these truths a reality in your life.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to get beyond the pain youve experienced at the hands of others, even as Jesus did. See how to forgive others and how to forgive yourself, so you can truly fulfill your destiny. Understand what the Bible really teaches about gossip, anger, and the Christians responsibility in judging others. Take a fresh, scriptural look at when to remit sins, when to retain sins, when to confront, and when to walk away.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you have just embarked on your spiritual quest or youve been a Christian for years, God wants to take you on a walk with Him that will liberate and heal you, enabling you to be all He intended you to be. Hear anew His call to follow Him on this spiritual road purchased for you by His own blood. Lift up your eyes and behold His glory. Experience the restoration of the joy of your salvation. Rejoice as you continue on your personal journey with Him, recognizing and following His signposts along the way.&lt;p&gt;" />
