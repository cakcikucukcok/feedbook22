  <title>Answered Prayers While You Were Out - Lee Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Answered Prayers While You Were Out - An Aneurysm Survivor&amp;rsquo;s Story ~ combined with Faith, Hope and Love; is a story portraying God&amp;rsquo;s miraculous healing power in the 21st Century. It takes you in depth into the many answered prayers of an aneurysm survivor and his wife as he overcame the odds when he was given a second chance at life. The will to survive, incorporated with faith, hope and love, which are the three gifts remaining to mankind, sets the platform for an earth shattering and mind blowing testimony of God&amp;#39;s goodness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This incredible story surrounds a wife&amp;rsquo;s faith and determination to defy all the odds including ignoring the facts presented to her; in order to keep her husband alive. This she did by doing the only thing she knew she was destined to do, to intercede on his behalf and pray without ceasing, fighting battles no one else could see. It depicts life as they knew it, and how in a split second everything changed as their entire world came crashing down taking with it all her hopes and dreams. In these pages lies their faith journey throughout the darkest season of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An insight on coping strategies and the varying stages of recovery is also given to assist those who may find themselves in a similar situation and often times ponder on what to do when they don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. In the midst of this, the importance of having a personal relationship with our Heavenly Father and trusting him through every situation we face is emphasized; as in spite of how one feels, the views of others, the facts laid out before them or what the world says, it is God who has the final say. This was highlighted in the various ways God came through in this their deepest, darkest season. No matter what we go through here on earth, God sees all knows all and understands all and no matter where you are He is right there with you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
