  <title>The Faith of Donald J. Trump - David Brody, Scott Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on extensive inside sources, including exclusive interviews with the President and Vice President, &lt;em&gt;The&amp;#160;Faith of Donald J. Trump&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;explores his rarely discussed, but deeply important, religious beliefs and relationships with leading Evangelicals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chief Political Correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network and the &quot;Jesus in the Public Square&quot; columnist for the &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt; explore the rarely discussed, but deeply important, religious beliefs and worldview of Donald J. Trump and his advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald J. Trump was raised as a Presbyterian and has praised both Christianity and the primacy of the Bible. In the Oval Office, he has surrounded himself with close advisors who share his deep faith. In this deeply reported book, David Brody and Scott Lamb draw on unparalleled access to the White House to explain President Trump&amp;#8217;s connection to the Christian faith, the evangelical right, the prosperity gospel, and the pressing moral and ethical issues of our day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In part, the authors argue, President Trump won over evangelicals not by pandering to them, but by supporting them and all their most important issues without pretending to be something he&amp;#8217;s not. Though the forty-fifth president is far from the perfect vessel&amp;#8212;he has been married three times&amp;#8212;his supporters argue that Donald Trump may be just what America needs. This book reveals how he has surrounded himself with believers who think he is the one guiding figure who can return us to the traditional values&amp;#8212;hard work, discipline, duty, respect, and faith&amp;#8212;that have long been the foundation of American life, and truly make America great again in all ways.&lt;/p&gt;" />
