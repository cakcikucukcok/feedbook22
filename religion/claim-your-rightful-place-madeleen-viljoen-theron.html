  <title>Claim Your Rightful Place - Madeleen Viljoen-Theron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is about change, and growing that part of your spirit that is in need of an upgrade. Claiming your rightful place in this life and owning the space you occupy is your birthright. Suffering from a false sense of unworthiness will have a negative effect on your physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. We sometimes fail to truly believe that we are good enough to deserve the very best, and we neglect to practice our new, proposed future every day. Now is the time to realize the magnificence of who you are and to claim your rightful place and shed the old skin of wrong belief systems and fear. Ignorance of what is going on in this world will keep you in a mental, emotional, and physical slavery. It is time to wake up. You are the something great this world needs; otherwise you would not be here." />
