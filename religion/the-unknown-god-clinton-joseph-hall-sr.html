  <title>The Unknown God - Clinton Joseph Hall Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Apostle Paul once responded to a group of pagan worshippers in Athens, Greece. One of the altars they worshipped at had an inscription written to THE UNKNOWN GOD.  Paul declared, Whom therefore ye worship in ignorance, him I declare unto you.   This glorious God who created all things, this glorious God with all creation in Him, this God who finished all things before He created all things, this God who chose you in Himself before the foundation of the world, this God who wrote your name in the Book of Life, either before the beginning or at the end or somewhere in between, and who turned the greatest of all gambles into no gamble at all, this Christ who was slain before creation, this Christ who is the glory of the Father, this Christ who is the All, who will be, and is, the All who is in All, this Christ who is the beginning and the end, this Christ who is free of, above and beyond and outside of all space, time, and even eternity, this Christ has a point to make, a message to bring to you. 
You will find that message in the pages of The Unknown God!  This world has a false godSatan the devil, whom the Bible says deceives the whole world! He appears as an angel of light! He is the great counterfeiter!  What God decrees, Satan finds a way to counterfeit! Find out the ways he goes about to deceive the world, especially most religious people!  The Bible is largely a book about Israel and the Jews and other people and nations who interact with them. Find out why all Jews are Israelites but not all Israelites are Jews!  Who were they, who are they now, and what will become of them in the future? And how do Gods plans for them relate to his plans for everyone else?  You will find all of this and more in the pages of The Unknown God!" />
