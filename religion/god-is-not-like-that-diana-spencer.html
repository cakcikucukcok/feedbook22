  <title>God Is Not Like That - Diana Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God is Not Like That challenges all Christians to think seriously about how the misunderstandings of the past are currently affecting Christianity worldwide.
The work of the Reformation was never finished, because the various factions involved split apart from each other without finding any common resolution to the problems facing the medieval church. The conclusions reached in God is Not Like That have been formulated after years of deliberation, in an effort to stimulate thought and discussion among all denominations of Christianity today. 
            Many problems that stem from these unresolved issues have been inherited by all denominations; for example, the author believes that the Athanasian Creed, while right in its original intent, has been misunderstood by everyone for many centuries. This has been compounded by the fact that for many years there have been growing doubts about the divinity of Christ and the doctrine of the Trinity, even among scholars and teachers, making it difficult for them to explain and defend the faith to an increasingly skeptical world. Meanwhile, its vocal critics do not realize that many of the ideas that they are challenging stem from mistaken assumptions from the past, not with the faith itself; it is urgent that these issues be examined and the distortions resolved.
Diana Spencer is a retired Anglican priest,  although the views expressed in this book are her own.  It was written in the hope that all denominations of Christianity would think about, and discuss, the issues raised. Born in England in 1935, she came to Canada at  the age of twenty-one, is widowed, and living in Victoria." />
