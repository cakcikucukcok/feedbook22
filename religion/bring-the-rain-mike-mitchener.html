  <title>Bring the Rain - Mike Mitchener</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a story about faith. As simple as that sounds, sometimes all of us need an example of how faith inevitably becomes the single most important component of who we are, what we do, and what we will become. At forty-seven, Mike suffered a widow-maker heart attack, which stopped his heart. This event resulted in multiple cardiac arrests, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolisms, and acute kidney injury. He was given a 0.5 percent chance of survival. His parents were advised to plan his funeral. Mike was unconscious for over two weeks, but he was never alone. Bring the Rain is an inspirational and personal account of Mike Mitcheners encounter with death and his time in heaven. This book is a quick read for anyone who is searching. Mike hopes that sharing his story will encourage others in their spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
