  <title>Being Remarkable - William Michael Rowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The teachings contained within &lt;I&gt;Being Remarkable&lt;/I&gt; provide an alternative to suffering, unhappiness &amp; discontent in life. All forms of suffering are addressed even the more subtle types of suffering that we have assumed up until now, are simply a part of everyday life. 
&lt;p&gt;
By clearing away the suffering we discover a tremendous power source that is readily available. This is not a quality for some, but actually is inherent in all human beings.  This content is time tested and amazingly simple because these qualities are already a part of each reader &amp; there is really nothing new to learn. In fact it may be more accurate to say that it is a self-exploration into you that will leave each one of you forever different &amp; more powerful-in almost a mystical way.  
&lt;p&gt;
As a result-the reader is left knowing exactly how to find their life purpose, transcend limitations and tap into an enormous source of peace &amp; wisdom.  They now go out into the world radiating this source of power &amp; being of the greatest benefit to themselves and the world around them." />
