  <title>Kingdom Family: Re-Envisioning God&#39;s Plan for Marriage and Family - Trevecca Okholm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a lot of talk these days about how churches need to become more missional and Kingdom-focused--but what about the families that make up our churches and often reflect the surrounding culture more than the Kingdom of God? Christian families know that God has a better purpose for marriage and family but often don&#39;t have the slightest idea how to get there. And while many books on Christian marriage and family are inwardly focused on simply getting along better, this book addresses the cultural influences that have taken our focus away from God&#39;s intended purpose for marriage and family and, through analysis and practical suggestions, recalls marriages and families to the purpose for which God intended them in the first place--namely, to serve God&#39;s Kingdom as witnesses to a world desperately seeking deeper purpose and authenticity." />
