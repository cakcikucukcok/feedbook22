  <title>Radical Sending: Go to Love and Serve - Demi Prentiss, J. Fletcher Lowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a congregation is seen as a base camp, a launching pad, a watering hole for its members- a place to regroup for their life beyond the doors of the building- then the Dismissal becomes the most important part of the liturgy next to being fed for the journey with the bread of life and the cup of salvation. As congregations explore their emerging visions, they need support in &quot;equipping the saints&quot; for their day to day lives and ministries. In many ways churches fail to focus on this baptismal calling to &quot;Go&quot; into our worlds of work, family, and community. This book will fill that void, focusing on how the Baptized become &quot;go-ers,&quot; while providing practical and tested ways of affecting that calling. Each chapter is followed by discussion questions for potential use in small groups or for personal reflection. There is an extensive resource list for future use.   Congregations are revitalized when they support the ministry of the laity - 99.2% of the church - in their lives and ministry as the &quot;church scattered.&quot; Their members are energized to discover their baptismal calling, engaging their skills and gifts wherever they find themselves, and that energy is contagious. In 2006 &quot;Radical Welcome&quot; (Stephanie Spellers) was published; it is a book about the &quot;come&quot; of the Christian faith. &quot;Radical Dismissal&quot; is a complement to the &quot;come&quot; with the &quot;go.&quot;" />
