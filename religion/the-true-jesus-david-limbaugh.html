  <title>The True Jesus - David Limbaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;A New York Times Bestseller!&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Who do you say that I am?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Uttered by Jesus Christ, this profound question has presented an age-old challenge to believers, skeptics, scholars, and rulers.&lt;br &gt;
In attempting to answer this question, &lt;em&gt;The True Jesus&lt;/em&gt; goes straight to the unimpeachable source: the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Only in the Gospels, says #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author David Limbaugh, do we come face-to-face with the Son of God, Whose sublime teachings, miraculous actions, and divine essence leap off every page and into our hearts.&lt;br &gt;
In this book, Limbaugh combines the four Gospel stories into a unified account (though not, he humbly admits, a perfect harmony) and guides readers on a faith journey through the Four Evangelists&#39; testimonies of the life of Jesus Christ. Along the way, Limbaugh shares his insights on Jesus&#39; words and deeds as well as His unique nature as fully human and fully divine. In &lt;em&gt;The True Jesus&lt;/em&gt;, you will learn:&lt;br &gt;
- Why even the apostles failed to completely understand Jesus&#39; true identity and mission until after His crucifixion&lt;br &gt;
- The real basis for the rejection of Jesus&#39; message by skeptics in His hometown and elsewhere&lt;br&gt;
- The historical events preceding Jesus&#39; birth that providentially paved the way for Christianity &lt;br&gt;
- How Jesus&#39; message utterly contradicted modern attempts to portray Him as being non-judgmental &lt;br&gt;
Limbaugh&#39;s passion for the Gospels infuses the pages of &lt;em&gt;The True Jesus&lt;/em&gt;, which is both a primer for new Bible readers and an outstanding guide to the Gospels for long-time believers. Who really is the true Jesus? Open this book and begin your odyssey toward the answer." />
