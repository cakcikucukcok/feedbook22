  <title>Hot Issues - Mark Ashton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Reality Check series makes just one assumption: that you’re serious enough about your spiritual journey to investigate Christianity with an open mind. This isn’t about joining anyone’s religious club—it’s about being real with yourself and with the others in your group. Since no one has all the answers, there’s plenty of room for discussion. After all, if there is any truth to the Bible’s stories about Jesus, then one thing he’d welcome are questions and opinions that come from honest, earnest hearts.Have you stopped to consider just how broken this planet really is? Look around you. Poverty, racism, intolerance, materialism, oppression of women . . . it doesn’t take long to see plenty that needs fixing. Hot Issues explores six current social evils that affect us all one way or another. They’ll come as no surprise—until you explore Jesus’ radical responses to the same issues in his time. Hot Issues includes these sessions: The Poverty Line Crossing the Racial Divide Handling Hypocrisy The Treatment of Women Materialism and the Moral Yuppie Religious Intolerance For the Group LeaderReality Check is for spiritual seekers of every persuasion. Uncompromisingly Christian in its perspective, it steers wide of pat answers and aims at honesty. This innovative and thought-provoking series will challenge you and those in your group to connect heart to heart as together you explore the interface between Jesus, the Bible, and the realities of this world in which we live." />
