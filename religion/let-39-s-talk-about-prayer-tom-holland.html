  <title>Let&#39;s Talk About Prayer - Tom Holland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though prayer is &amp;#39;the Christian&amp;#39;s vital breath&amp;#39; it raises many questions: if God is in control of everything what&amp;#39;s the point of praying? how is prayer related to healing? what about &amp;#39;unanswered&amp;#39; prayer?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this remarkable bookTom Holland uses a series of conversations between a pastor and members of his congregation to help us think through these and other questions in the light of biblical teaching.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tom Holland brings to this book the wisdom of a long-serving minister, the heart of a caring pastor, and the knowledge of an internationally respected theologian. That is a very rare combination and no subject is better served by it than a discussion of prayer. In these pages you will discover not only profound truth simply explained but answers to the questions we have all asked when struggling to pray. -&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Rev. Phil Hill BA, MPhil,&amp;nbsp;Pastoral and Church Theologian, Wales Evangelical School of Theology,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tom Holland asks the right questions and thereby primes the pump for an eminently readable, engaging and informative reflection on the practice of prayer. All readers, whatever their spiritual maturity, will find much to stimulate their thinking and better equip them to pray. -&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Dr Lawson Murray, President - Scripture Union Canada.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a unique book. Its teaching on prayer through dialogue makes it an easy and fast-paced read that proves challenging to one&amp;#39;s prayer life. And the characters bring to it a pastoral reality, as issues such as parenthood, bereavement, healing, and personal evangelism are dealt with. A great little aid for all of us who wrestle in prayer. -&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Natalie Brand, lecturer, writer and mother&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book deals with many questions about prayer, constantly asked by Christians; for instance, &amp;#39;Why pray when God is sovereign? &amp;#39;What about healing?&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Since Jesus said &amp;quot;I do not pray for the world&amp;quot;, should we pray for unbelievers?&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;One chapter is particularly relevant for a young couple with their first baby intruding into their &amp;#39;quite times&amp;#39;. This chapter also lays stress on the importance of prayer with others - the church prayer meeting. The final chapter, on prayer in times of darkness, is moving, for the couple face the possibility of the death of their child.&amp;nbsp;All in all helpful, unusual and not without challenge for believers at every stage, although particularly helpful for those young in age and spiritual maturity. -&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Philip Grist in The Evangelical Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
