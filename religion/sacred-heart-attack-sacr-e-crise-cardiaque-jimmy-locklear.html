  <title>Sacred Heart Attack | Sacrée Crise Cardiaque - Jimmy Locklear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Even though I knew how the story would end, I couldnt stop reading once I started. Jimmy narrates with attention to detail and with emotional vulnerability. I felt I was right there with him at each step of his journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carolyn J. Hansen, writer and creative director; Ajijic, Jalisco, Mexico &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacred Heart Attack gives an insiders view of a process filled with tension, fear, and miracle. You can just about feel the slushy cold mixture of iodine and alcohol cascading over the chest, hear the incessant beeping of the monitors, and sense the gratitude for dedicated caregivers. Locklear looks beneath the surface of one of lifes most difficult experiences to find the strong hands of God carrying him through each hour of each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Claude Marshall, pastor, James River Community Church; Suffolk, Virginia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is easyneither living or enduring and recuperating from a heart attack, as Jimmy Locklear writes in his insightful book, Sacred Heart Attack. Finding meaningand hopeis just one part of this story. For Jimmy also shows a commitment to not only his personal story but the story of others involved in this process. He does not give himself to despair or bitterness. In fact, he perseveres to the end. In so doing he invites the reader to join him in his story and to make it part of their story. It is a wonderful experience.&lt;/p&gt;
