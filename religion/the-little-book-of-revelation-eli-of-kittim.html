  <title>The Little Book of Revelation - Eli of Kittim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a fascinating study in search of the real Jesus. The author concludes that scripture is essentially a collection of prophecies, not a record of past events. Jesus did not say, &quot;Blessed is he who heeds the words of the history of this book,&quot; but rather &quot;Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book.&quot; Thus, the current tenets of Christianity with regard to the origin and advent of Jesus are based on fundamental misconceptions. The books argument is that Christs visitation has not yet occurred in the world of time, since it is a future event, and that his origin will be derived from the Greeks, not the Jews, when he does appear.&lt;/p&gt;" />
