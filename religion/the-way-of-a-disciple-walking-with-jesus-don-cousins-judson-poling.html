  <title>The Way of a Disciple: Walking with Jesus - Don Cousins, Judson Poling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Walking with God &lt;/em&gt;series was developed as the curriculum for small groups at Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois. Since its release in 1992, it has been used by churches and small groups to help raise up devoted disciples of Christ. Group members who work through the program will lay a solid foundation for a lifelong walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While small groups may be formed for a variety of purposes, the goal of this curriculum is for groups to produce disciples&amp;mdash;fully devoted followers of Christ&amp;mdash;by studying God&amp;rsquo;s Word in community. To this end, the goal of the study is to produce disciples who &lt;em&gt;walk with God, &lt;/em&gt;have a personal relationship with Jesus, and live in step with the Holy Spirit. It is also to produce believers who &lt;em&gt;live the Word&lt;/em&gt; in all areas of life and &lt;em&gt;contribute to the work&lt;/em&gt; that God is doing in the local church. Ultimately, the goal is to develop believers who &lt;em&gt;impact the world &lt;/em&gt;and are prepared and eager to spread the good news of Christ to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This material will help develop these attributes in group members. Each lesson includes group Bible study and discussion questions in addition to devotions, reflections, and personal study for use by individuals between the group sessions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
