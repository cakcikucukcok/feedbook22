  <title>The Daniel Prayer Study Guide - Anne Graham Lotz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel your prayers are anemic? Hollow? Then this six-session video Bible study (DVD sold separately) is for you! Bestselling author Anne Graham Lotz looks at the life of Daniel and unpacks the prayer he prayed in Daniel 9. Unlike the everyday now-I-lay-me-down-to-sleep kind of prayer, this was a prayer birthed under heartache...grief...desperation. It was a plea for Heaven to move and change his nation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an entire generation, Daniel&#39;s people had been held in captivity and separated from their homeland&amp;ndash;and thus separated from God. But when Daniel read a prophecy in which God said He would restore His people to Jerusalem after seventy years, he claimed that promise and cried out to the Lord to bring it to pass. Daniel&#39;s example of praying God&#39;s Word back to Him is what Anne calls &quot;reversed thunder.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Anne explains how we, too, can reverse the thunder until Heaven is moved and our own worlds change. Following the pattern of Daniel&#39;s original prayer, she helps us develop a more meaningful and powerful prayer life. As we learn how to storm the gates of Heaven and refuse to let go, we will see real change in the lives of not only those we are praying for, but also our own. Our prayers will become more effective as our faith is deepened and our personal relationship with God is strengthened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guide includes weekly Bible study readings, video teaching notes, group discussion questions, group activities, and space for writing your own prayers. It is ideal for use in small groups and Sunday school classes and includes a simplified Bible study track for more limited meeting time (such as a workplace lunchtime setting).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sessions include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preparing for Prayer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prompting in Prayer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pleading in Prayer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prevailing in Prayer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Battle in Prayer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study guide is designed for use with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Daniel Prayer Video Study&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(sold separately).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Facilitator&#39;s Guide is included on the DVD only, with Additional Resources.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
