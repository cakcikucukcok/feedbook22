  <title>Facing the Waterfall - Andrea Hovet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Becoming a Christian at a young age is common in many sects of Christianity. Andrea Hovet lived a destructive life under the assumption she was a Christian. Through abuse, hardships, and self-hatred, she blamed her misfortunes on God. She strayed form His path and became lost in the abyss of her sorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is based on the journal kept during the year she learned how deeply God loves her. This is her story. It portrays the grief as well as the joy and love she discovered when she finally laid her doubt and self-hatred before the Lord. She went from being a nonbeliever living in sin to committing herself to Gods holy name. The changes she went through and the changes in her perspective on life are just a few of the different ways God healed her brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Facing the Waterfall&lt;/i&gt; is the metaphor God gave her in order to help her visualize the love He is pouring over her each and every day. All she need do is lift her face and allow Him to fill every crevice of her heart and soul with His unwavering love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
