  <title>Missional: Impossible!: The Death of Institutional Christianity and the Rebirth of G-D - Francis Rothery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mainline Christianity in the West is dying. Addiction to hierarchical and bureaucratic power is killing it. A management-god and a mission-god have usurped the Way of Christ. In the midst of decline the missional movement is attempting to reboot the church. Its goal is to remake a New Christian West through mission, leadership, mapping, and planning. Yet it is trapped in the language and methods of modernity. Its final solution is a polarizing vision of cultural domination by one social group, the Christians. The Way of Life and Truth has been forgotten. Christ is not a conquering King, a written Word, or an absolute Idea, but a divine Human Being. Social wholeness can only be realized through a rediscovery of Conversation, Reconciliation, and Empowerment. These reflect Christ&#39;s practices of eternal dialogue and reciprocal giving in small communities. Through this mutual Way of Life people of all faiths (and none) can discover deep within themselves Our Un/Known G-d. A gentle voice is whispering in the heart of all humanity, I am . . . the Way." />
