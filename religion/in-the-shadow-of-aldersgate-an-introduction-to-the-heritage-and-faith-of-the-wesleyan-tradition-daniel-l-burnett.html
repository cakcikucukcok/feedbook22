  <title>In the Shadow of Aldersgate: An Introduction to the Heritage and Faith of the Wesleyan Tradition - Daniel L. Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Wesley (1703-91) was a unique character in history who left a disproportionately large imprint on the world. That imprint was a contagious passion for what he called real Christianity--the Good News of saving grace and scriptural holiness.    This book examines Wesley&#39;s life and faith in order to better understand what it means to be a present-day participant in that legacy. The book begins with the story of Wesley&#39;s search for an authentic Christian experience. His steps are traced from his early days of struggle, through his conversion at Aldersgate, to his long years of remarkable ministry. The second part of the book outlines the basic Wesleyan understandings of sin, grace, redemption, new birth, sanctification, and perfection. A concluding exploration of some practical implications of the Wesleyan doctrine of holiness is found in the third part.     This book celebrates the Wesleyan tradition, especially that branch known as the Holiness Movement. It is, however, not entirely uncritical. It seeks to provide an honest and sympathetic consideration of the heritage and faith of Wesley&#39;s lasting imprint." />
