  <title>A Voice from the Heavens - William E. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you dying to see NASA&#39;s fantastic new discoveries that confirms the Bible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you look up to the Heavens at night, you will view the Universe as how God architected it 13 billion years ago and realize it is a lot more than suns, moons, planets, or galaxies, it is a Painting of God&#39;s work, as written in the Holy Bible.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic foundation of Astronomy is provided followed by 17 chapters describing amazing Biblical Scriptures, written over 2,000 years ago. You will then be in awe by many Hubble pictures that directly represent those Biblical scriptures!  The author provides unfathomable visual and audio dimensions that directly relate to each scripture to accelerate your belief in God&#39;s works and grow in His word. For example, take a look at the book cover which shows the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51).  In the book you will be astounded by a Holy Cross located  in the middle of the galaxy which is 1,100 light across!  A rocket traveling the speed of light would take 1,100 light years to traverse the cross! The book is filled with numerous examples of Gods magnificence, as written in the scripture Psalm 19:1-2: The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.&lt;/p&gt;" />
