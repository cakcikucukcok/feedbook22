  <title>Covenant Keeper&#39;s Weapon - Dr. Buti W. Makwakwa Dth Phd.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In my previous book, Giving to God Is an Investment, my emphasis was prophetically based on the auditorium to be built. In this book, I am now talking about the auditorium worth six point five million rand that was dedicated in 2005. With God all things are possible. Those who trust in him, their faces will not be covered by shame. Our auditorium veranda for Xihlovo Cafeteria is only now complete recently.
For nothing is impossible with God. (Luke 1: 37)
God has impressed in my heart that if we build capacity to contain we must as well build capacity to maintain. Capacity to contain requires finances to maintain the standard of work achieved. When we grow numerically, we should as well grow financially and spiritually.
God is not only building our church but the all-sufficient one is building an institution. This is a large tree with a big shade where the weary, unwanted, rejected, abused, divorced, separated, misused, thirsty and hungry shall come and take refuge and find rest. This vision is unique in its kind; it cannot be compared with any other vision from somewhere.
This is an institution to feed thousands of thousands; it is a hospital to the wounded. It is a university for those who want to excel in character-building and integrity  those whose hearts are after Gods own heart, those who will serve him in holiness, righteousness, and purity of heart. It will not just be people ushered in but those who were touched by the holy conviction and brought by the Holy Spirit into his house.
This is Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem and the city of the living God. When you come, you come to the thousands upon thousands of angels in a joyful assembly, to the church of the first-born whose names are written in heaven. When you come, you come to God, the judge of all men, to the spirit of righteous men made perfect, to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused him, who warned them on earth, how much less will we if we turn away from him who warns you from heaven?
Hebrews 12: 2225
As the Rector of Hardrock Academy of Leadership Training and Life Training College, I compelled to ask those who read this book to come to obedience of his commands, as you cannot become unless you come. Come and follow me as I follow Christ. It is a great experience to build the house of God. We have been tested, opposed and criticised, but the Lord has delivered us form all delaying spirits and Sanballats. There are differences in the body which are expressions of legitimate diversity, others are demoralising to those who do not know on how to master the art of spiritual warfare but to some they are church diving with its divergence and separations. We need to strategise a convergence of building in unison and Kingdom-mindedness, of having the mind of Christ, by building Gods Kingdom and not our kingdoms.
For thine is the Kingdom, the power and glory. (Matt. 6: 13)" />
