  <title>What We Really Want - Rev. Shirley Leighton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The First Faith of the Future is designed in an attempt to free you
from the prison of belief in dogmatic systems which strip you of your
personal power.
The goal of all religions began with the desire in the hearts of
men and women to know God and to feel His protection from higher
dimensions. Sadly enough, many of the resulting dictates have reduced
the human family to slavery, while satisfying the egocentric needs of
church leaders. Your pleas of help may rarely appear to reach any
kind of assistance, but the truth is that we are always divinely connected,
protected, and directed. Believe it!
What do we really want, anyway? We can acquire the riches of the
physical, material world only to discover that we are empty  that they
havent fulfi lled our needs at all. Only after owning assets which we
gladly discard for peace of mind can a person understand that emptiness
(often called the existential vacuum.) Life can have no meaning without
the spiritual dimensions which are necessary for us to feel like our real
selves.
What makes your heart beat? What force breathes your body for
you? All the many systems of our bodies which continue to function without
our help ask the question of the mystery which sustains a human life. How
do we explain our beingness without a connection to the Divine?
The faith we need to develop is in answer to these puzzling questions.
Creative and loving, making our future days by our attitudes today, we
need to be grateful for the sustenance of our heavenly parents who love
us, whether we understand the whole picture or not. It is all a divine
comedy  drama  farce or tragedy. What do we want our lives to be?
God is always present when were aware.
The sense of connection within our own hearts and souls allows
us companionship and security above and beyond all else. That will
never be taken from us, since it is inviolate and ours to be treasured by
ourselves forever." />
