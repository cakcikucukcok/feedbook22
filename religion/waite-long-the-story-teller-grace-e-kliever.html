  <title>Waite Long - the Story Teller - Grace E. Kliever</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The life of Waite Long is mostly seen as a recluse person
who is promoting fear for those around him. This kind of life is
creating many emotions with questions and also disbelief.
Lifestyle becomes fear, leaving no answers. At least it seemed.
The response of others living in the same neighborhood
brings gossip and fear. Nothing is related to time, and so the daily
life becomes a life of questions with many challenges.
Then the answers come! When we allow changes then we
know love conquers all with many surprises. The time it takes in
changing for the good is like conquering mountains! It&#39;s very
exhilarating and stimulating.
&lt;P&gt;Waite&#39;s life was like an open investigation full of excitement
- but mostly the feeling of being alone.
There are a lot of crossroads in life and many storms for
some people, both physically and mentally. Plus the many times
of loneliness for each of us. We all need to learn.
Not all of life is negative, although being able to rest in
loneliness, feeling peaceful among strife or danger or loving in
spite of hatred or misconception. Puzzles become roadmaps!
Trails are to climb and also come down! Everything is there to
conquer and to use patience.
&lt;P&gt;Challenge promotes growth. We have to remember it&#39;s
only when the end comes that we can relax.
Getting there requires adjustments - surprises - endurance
- even when questions keep coming. We can conquer all, then
the life becomes triumphant and happiness and the strength to go
on - and on to even better things! We feel better inside in spite of
the ways of others.
&lt;P&gt;Please look at things in life kindly, how it affects others and
how it makes others react. That is my wish and purpose.
