  <title>Gentiles and the Law of Moses - Ange-Michel Muhayimana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this grace-filled and thoroughly researched book, author Ange-Michel Muhayimana shows the role that Moses played in the giving of the law to the nation of Israel. He also shows how the law of Moses excluded the Gentiles from citizenship in the land of Israel, how Gentiles were foreigners to Gods covenants recorded in the Bible, and how those known as proselytes were included in the law of Moses for their citizenship in the nation of Israel.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Using many New Testament passages, the author shows how Jesus considered Gentiles and how the early church leaders, such as Paul and Peter, understood that the law of Moses was never given to the Gentile nations and consequently preached Jesus without the law of Moses when in front of a gentile audience. He finally shows how as a new covenant believer you can live a life free of legalism by trusting in Jesus and his finished work alone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
