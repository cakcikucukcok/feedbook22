  <title>When Will the Sun Set in Africa? - Chun Bulus Chun, Dr. Chris Ampadu PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will help you;
Be Committed in God, seek to be different, be the best and make an Impact. 
In your journey of making a difference with and in God, transforming your life and asking Him to change your perspective about life. 
Take a generation in specific tasks, count the cost, and become willing to make the required sacrifices.
I hear the nation celebrating a bride 
Your light is come.
Christianity will become difficult when you think it all depends on you to make it work.
Its only a changed heart that changes lives. You must learn to daily seek personal growth.
It takes God to change men, no matter how powerful you sound, result-oriented you are, it takes God to lift up your eyes, ears to see and hear beyond now.
You can go high but you wouldnt become or be strong.
With the worlds focus shifting to Africa, what is the most required thing to make Africa a trans-generational success.
Recognizing the dignity and true value of man, and seeing a person for who he/she really is and not what his/her circumstances are.
A significant approach to dealing with Africas fundamental issues on character, corruption, diversity, dignity and equality. Where every African is seen as a valuable stakeholder in the rebirth of the continent and contributor to the human race." />
