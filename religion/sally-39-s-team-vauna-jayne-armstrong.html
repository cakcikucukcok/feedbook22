      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After performing a partial birth abortion, Dr. David Hampstead is disgusted with himself and seeks forgiveness, becoming a Christian. A few months later, his mentor and friend (the doctor that talked him into doing the partial birth abortion) has a heart attack and won&#39;t go into surgery until David agrees to take his patient the next day. Against the advice of his good friend, Kyle-an anesthesiologist-David promises to help the woman. When he finds out that it is a late-term abortion, a plan hatches. They fake the abortion and actually deliver the baby alive and, with the help of an old rebel pastor, smuggle her to an adoption agency. Feeling that saving this baby, and more, is the right thing to do, they perform more fake abortions. Soon they are joined by others who love the Lord as well as unborn children. In spite of the danger of losing their medical licenses or going to jail, over the next two years, the &quot;team&quot; rescues over eighty babies from women with a broad variety of stories. They hope to be put out of business by the federal government outlawing late-term abortions rather than by getting caught.&lt;/p&gt;" />
