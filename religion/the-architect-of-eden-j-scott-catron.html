  <title>The Architect of Eden - J. Scott Catron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THERE IS A STORY BEHIND THE STORY OF GOD&#39;S CREATION ACCOUNT IN GENESIS.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are about to go on an exciting journey through Eden&#39;s garden to discover the master plan God designed for mankind. As the original blueprint to humanity is unrolled, mysteries that have been hidden throughout the ages will be revealed. Through each day of creation, you will be guided on a behind-the-scenes tour that will help you better understand who God is, so you can better understand who you are.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE PREPARED TO SEE GOD IN WAYS YOU&#39;VE NEVER SEEN HIM.&lt;br&gt;
BE PREPARED TO SEE YOURSELF IN WAYS YOU&#39;VE NEVER SEEN YOURSELF.&lt;br&gt;
AND BE PREPARED TO BECOME SOMEONE YOU&#39;VE NEVER YET BECOME.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;However, as it is written; No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love Him --But God has revealed it to us by His Spirit.&quot;  (I Cor. 2:910)
