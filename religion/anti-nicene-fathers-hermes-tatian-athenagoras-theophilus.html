These variant writings have been handed down through the ages as being the foundation for much of our inherited doctrine, from which we have a ready reference to the customs and practices of the &quot;Early Christian Church&quot;. &quot;The Ante-Nicene Fathers&quot; ranges from the Apostolic Fathers to various third and fourth century sources including the liturgies and ancient Syriac documents. It was intended to comprise translations into English of all the extant works of the Fathers down to the date of the first General Council held at Nicaea in 325 A.D. The Ante-Nicene Fathers set enables modern readers to see for themselves what the early Christians believed on a variety of subjects such as baptism, communion, salvation, eternal security, predestination, gifts of the Spirit, life after death, war, abortion, and the Trinity.   This is Vol. 2 Bk. 1." />
