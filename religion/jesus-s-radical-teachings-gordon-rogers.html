  <title>Jesus’S Radical Teachings - Gordon Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is easy sometimes to push the Lord out of our minds.  He is so holy, pristine and powerful; how could Jesus ever be interested in me you think?  You have made mistakes. We all have made mistakes.   Perhaps you were in trouble with the law.  You bounced some checks accidently. You havent prayed for a long time.  You lost your job because you lost your temper.  Again, you may say, why would God ever want me?  All of us have had these thoughts in our most difficult moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord created humankind.  He is an authority, an expert on humanity.  God declares that he loves you with a mighty, magnificent and marvelous love.  The topics in this book are very important for us.  They come to us from the lips of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus teaches us about gratitude, grace, giving, trust, positive influence, helping others, humility, forgiveness and action.  God teaches us the value of each of these traits. When we incorporate these actions or traits into our lives, we are blessed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some of Jesuss teachings are radical.  He tells us to love our enemies, to forgive the unforgivable, to not think of ourselves as great masters but to be lowly servants.  He declares that all people are very important.  You may say some of his teachings are crazy but they are crazy good.  If we can be filled with gratitude, grace, trust, generosity, humility, ministering to those in need and having a pure mind and heart.  It is then that we find Gods peace and grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
