  <title>I Can  Hear Your Face - Joan L. Brumble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ABOUT THE BOOK
God has spoken to me on numerous occasions in reference to the title of the book.  I even shared the concept with a visiting pastor, perhaps making it a sermon, but to no avail. I had felt it had fallen on deaf ears.  But, later, I knew that was part of Gods plan.
	When the idea of ICHYF, (I Can Hear Your Face), was conceived in my heart and spirit, it became alive and burned within my soul and then it came, my Heavenly Father spoke to me: I choose you; I am the one who inspired and planted the seed in your heart.  I am the one keeping this concept alive.  I nourished it continually.  Write it down my daughter.  I will give you the inspiration to write the words as coming from me.  Live through them my daughter, make my words come alive.  It pleases me that you are willing to obey me.  Remember my words when I said that I know you have little strength, youve tried your best to keep my word and you have not denied my name.  These words will be my testimony of the truth.  I cannot deny my own name. 
	That which was first conceived in my spirit and my heart, ICHYF, really isnt anything new, but it is speaking to a new audience perhaps because of a generational gap in coming from a solid Christian home.
All the trials, heartaches, much pain in my life, God has worked out for good.  What he has and is doing in my life, he will do for you. Listen for God to whisper how much he loves you at the turn of every page. All through the writing process, I prayed for each one of you, my readers that you will be truly be blessed by our Abba Father." />
