  <title>Keys to Living a Fulfilled Life - Taiwo Ayodele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not only can you improve your life and become a better you, you can certainly live joyfully, live a stress free life, a debt free life, enjoy a long lasting career, a healthy relationship, peaceful marital life, live a successful and fulfilled life every day of your life. The author Taiwo Ayodele suggests, it is important that you discover the purpose why you are here on earth for  Vision. Vision is what God created you for here on earth, what you are born to do. God has decided your vision before you were born but it is your responsibility to discover it. 
Jer. 1:5 (AMP) - Before I formed you in the womb I knew [and] approved of you [as My chosen instrument], and before you were born I separated and set you apart, consecrating you; [and] I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. 
This scripture confirms that God decides our vision as a manufacturer will decide and determine the function of its products, ie the electric light bulb did not discover itself, it was discovered by Thomas Edison; Henry Ford discovered automobiles. Likewise, we ought to discover Gods given assignment for our lives here on earth. The mobile phone manufacturers decided that the phones should be used for communication either via text messaging or voice communication or email. The phone is not meant to be used for ironing (that is not its function) or cooking (that is not its function). Obviously not. God is our manufacturer, we are the products. The products cannot determine its functionality without the manufacturer speculating what the product should do and how it should be used and for how long. There is a time span also to which a product must exist or last for. Discovering and knowing all these will help you to plan, organize your life here on earth and live it to the fullest as God desires  John 10:10b, Jer. 29:11.
Taiwo Ayodele reveals profound principles that when adhered to will help you discover your vision, potentials, and the fulfilled life that God offers you and how to fully live it. This will help you become all that God wants you to be. In a nutshell, Taiwo explains Biblical principles on how to live above the stigma of questionable events and negative memories of the past and all these will enlighten and motivate you to seek the best life that is on offer for you. 
Within the book, Taiwo Ayodele elaborates on topics such as forgiveness, discovering Gods master plan for your life, knowing His way of doing things, the benefit of knowing God and His ways, understanding His direction  How to execute His Master plan, His requirements and finally practical examples of how to fulfill the heavenly vision here on earth. How to improve your life? Vision and Direction that Works will help you become all that God wants you to be in life, reach your God-given potentials, fulfill your dream and vision and enjoy the best life that God designed for you. You will be overwhelmed by how much blessings, dominions, authorities, grace and much more that God has made available to you. These Biblical principles will enable you to utilize them to the fullest. If you grasp and obey these great principles, you will make your heavenly Father happy and you will be happy for the rest of your life." />
