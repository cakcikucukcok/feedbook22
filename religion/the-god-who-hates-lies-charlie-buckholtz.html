  <title>The God Who Hates Lies - Charlie Buckholtz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insights, Ideas and Thoughtful Questions for Discussing with Students the Challenging—Often Startling—Insights of Renowned Jewish Philosopher David Hartman and His Covenantal Theology for the Modern Engaged Jew&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a helpful guide to creative use of &lt;em&gt;The God Who Hates Lies: Confronting and Rethinking Jewish Tradition&lt;/em&gt; in the classroom. It features intriguing discussion questions to guide students in an exploration of key themes found in Dr. Hartman&#39;s groundbreaking journey to the heart of halavah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This teaching tool will help you guide each student in an examination of some of the most profound questions of the inner religious conflict. The result will be a deeper understanding of the schism between human experience and religious commitment—and how to rectify it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About &lt;em&gt;The God Who Hates Lies: Confronting and Rethinking Jewish Tradition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this deeply personal look at the struggle between commitment to Jewish religious tradition and personal morality, Dr. David Hartman, the world&#39;s leading Modern Orthodox Jewish theologian, probes the deepest questions at the heart of what it means to be a human being and a Jew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hartman draws on a lifetime of learning, teaching and experience as a social activist to present an intellectual framework for examining covenantal theology as it is applied to religious life. As much an expression of his impassioned commitment to Jewish law as it is testament to a lifetime of intellectual questioning and courage, this bold examination of the halakhic system offers fresh insights into Judaism and the quest for spiritual nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
