  <title>Seeds of Destruction - Thomas Merton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas Merton&lt;/b&gt; (1915-1968) is one of the foremost spiritual thinkers of the twentieth century. Though he lived a mostly solitary existence as a Trappist monk, he had a dynamic impact on world affairs through his writing. An outspoken proponent of the antiwar and civil rights movements, he was both hailed as a prophet and castigated for his social criticism. He was also unique among religious leaders in his embrace of Eastern mysticism, positing it as complementary to the Western sacred tradition. Merton is the author of over forty books of poetry, essays, and religious writing, including &lt;i&gt;Mystics and Zen Masters&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Seven Story Mountain&lt;/i&gt;, for which he is best known. His work continues to be widely read to this day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
