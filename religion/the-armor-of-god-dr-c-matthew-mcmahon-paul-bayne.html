  <title>The Armor of God - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon, Paul Bayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul Bayne (1573-1617) was a famous puritan divine, used by God for the conversion of many puritan giants, such as Richard Sibbes. He was celebrated as a powerful and intense Reformed preacher. 
From Ephesians 6:10-18, Bayne teaches the reader what it means to wear the armor of God in the most profitable manner. He shows that the world, the flesh and the devil fight vigilantly against the Christian to pull him down to hell. Being in battle means a wise Christian must be about preparatory work, or the Christian will in fact be unable to fight effectively. Christians must prepare themselves before the day of temptation actually arrives. Fully clothed with the armor, one submits themselves to God, and the devil will ultimately flee – though not without a violent fight.
