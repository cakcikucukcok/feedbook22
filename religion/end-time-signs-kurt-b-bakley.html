  <title>End Time Signs - Kurt B. Bakley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Will Israel and the U.S. be destroyed or partially destroyed in 2012-2019 or 2026-2030 and beyond and Muslims, Catholics and communism take over most of the world?  Were there strange things going around the sun, the moon changing degrees and phases, stars that aren&#39;t where there suppose to be and the magnetic poles changing mostly reported secretly in 2001-2011?  Did NASA or scientists and astronomers brush the pictures of them away so not to scare people?  Did the Bible Code predict strange behavior of the moon in 2011?  Will a great tidal wave hit the U.S. East Coast in 2012-2019 and Yellowstone Park super volcano erupt or a comet or asteroid hits the earth or Ocean in 2026-2030 and utterly destroy the entire United States if it still around after the war of 2012-2019?  Will the Muslims, communism and Catholics persecute Christians, Americans and Jews all over the world bringing them before Kings and have them sent to prisons and torture and killed if they don&#39;t deny Christ and convert to Islam?  Will Muslims and people all over the world begin to mock and scoff at Christians and the Bible because Israel and the U.S. are destroyed and no Rapture or end or Second Coming of Christ happened?  Several of the Bible prophecies predict God will not make a full end of the U.S., Israel and the world at this time and pockets of people and nations may or may not survive.  God may save the U.S., Israel and the world if the people repent and turn from their sins and begin to humble themselves and heed the harbingers.  But if they don&#39;t then these events may start to happen.  This book was written by June 12, 2012.&lt;br&gt;" />
