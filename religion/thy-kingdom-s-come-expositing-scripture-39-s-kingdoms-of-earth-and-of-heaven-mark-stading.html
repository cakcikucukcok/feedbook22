  <title>Thy Kingdom(s) Come: Expositing Scripture&#39;s Kingdoms of Earth and of Heaven - Mark Stading</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Hebrew and Greek Scriptures both prophecy of a Coming Divine Kingdom. The Prophets foretell of Israel&#39;s Kingdom to Come and the Apostles foretell of the Church&#39;s Kingdom to Come. The question is, are Judaism and Christianity expecting the same Prophetic Kingdom to Come? For Whom Does Thy Kingdom Come? This book will tackle this great Scriptural Question. The historical problem has been Judaism and Christianity dividing the Scripture with neither side seeking to find harmony between the two halves of Scripture. What is needed is a perspective that is not influenced by Tradition and which seeks to bring the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures together as if having been inspired by the same Author. For those readers capable of upholding this simple principle will find this book breaking down the barriers that exist between Scripture and revealing what kind of harmony can be found between its two halves. But reader beware! What is unveiled for the human eye to see goes beyond chartered waters." />
