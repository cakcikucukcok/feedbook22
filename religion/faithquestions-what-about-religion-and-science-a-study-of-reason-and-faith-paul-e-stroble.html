  <title>FaithQuestions - What About Religion and Science?: A Study of Reason and Faith - Paul E. Stroble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book invites us to consider ways to remain confident in our faith as we understand and appreciate the discoveries and advances of science. How can Christians integrate, believe, or accept all the teachings of science, the Bible, and Christian tradition? How can we believe in both the discoveries of science and the Bible? Are science and religion compatible or incompatible? Does the Christian understanding that God created the universe exclude the findings and discoveries of science? What is the role of faith in the world of education? What can we believe about intelligent design? If we believe in evolution, can we believe in God? Does the Big Bang theory exclude God? If we are Christians, can we support stem-cell research and cloning? Can science help us understand the afterlife? Does science negate or support prayer? What is the difference between faith and reason? Do they exclude or complement one another? As Paul Stroble addresses these questions and others, he helps us examine different possible ways that religion and science relate to each other and ways that science and religion provide meaning and value in our lives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PAUL STROBLE is an elder of the Illinois Great Rivers Conference of The United Methodist Church. He has served both as parish pastor and college instructor and currently teaches at the University of Akron, where he earned an Excellence in Teaching award. He is a long-time writer-researcher for the United Methodist curriculum &lt;i&gt;FaithLink&lt;/i&gt; and author of numerous articles and curricular materials. Among his eleven books are &lt;i&gt;Paul and the Galatians&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;What Do Other Faiths Believe?&lt;/i&gt; He is married to Dr. Beth Stroble, and they have a daughter, Emily. &lt;/p&gt; The FaithQuestions study series is designed to meet the needs of people who have questions about the Christian faith and who desire a deeper engagement with scripture and with discipleship as they explore studies of issues in theology, ethics, missions, Bible interpretation, and church history. It seeks to equip a new generation of church leaders to appreciate the eternal message of the gospel and to develop the skills to articulate its relevance in our contemporary context. The series would be a good choice for users who have completed Disciple. &lt;br /&gt; this will be the ninth study in the series, following What About the Rapture -&lt;br /&gt; What Do Other Faiths Believe - What Happens When We Die -&lt;br /&gt; What About Divine Healing - What About the Trinity - What About Forgiveness&lt;br /&gt; - What About the Devil - What About Reading the Bible" />
