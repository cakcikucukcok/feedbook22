  <title>Godly Letters: The Literature of the American Puritans - Michael J. Colacurcio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Godly Letters, Michael J. Colacurcio analyzes a treasury of works written by the first generation of seventeenth-century American Puritans. Arguing that insufficient scrutiny has been given this important oeuvre, he calls for a reevaluation of the imaginative and creative qualities of America&#39;s early literature of inspired ecclesiological experiment, one that focuses on the quality of the works as well as the demanding theology they express.      Colacurcio gives a detailed, richly contextualized account of the meaning of these &quot;godly letters&quot; in rhetorical, theological, and political terms. From his close readings of the major texts by the first generation of Puritans-including William Bradford, Thomas Hooker, Edward Johnson, John Winthrop, Thomas Shepard, and John Cotton-he expertly illuminates qualities other studies have often overlooked. In his words, close study of the literature yields work &quot;comprehensive, circumspect, determined subtle, energetic, relentlessly intellectual, playful in spite of their cultural prohibitions, in spite of themselves, even, they are in every way remarkable products of a culture that . . . assigned an extraordinarily high place to the life of words.&quot; Magisterial in sweep, Godly Letters is likely to stand as the definitive work on the Puritan literary achievement." />
