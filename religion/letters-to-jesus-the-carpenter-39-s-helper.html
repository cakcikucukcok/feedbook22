  <title>Letters to Jesus - The Carpenter&#39;s helper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who is the Carpenter&#39;s helper? He is just a flawed and ordinary man who was infected with the desire some twelve years ago to begin meditating upon the Word of God every morning and praying Gods words back to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are words that praise the Almighty God in Heaven, words that humbly confess the shame of his sin, and words that passionately plead for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice to use the pseudonym The Carpenters helper was made because Letters to Jesus is not so much about what the author has to say but about letting the power of the Word of God have its way in our hearts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Word of God is sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Heb 4:12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Carpenter&#39;s helper has been pierced by the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God, and compelled to share the thoughts and questions of his heart with the Father of mercies and God of all comfort. May the precious Word of God have its way with you as well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
