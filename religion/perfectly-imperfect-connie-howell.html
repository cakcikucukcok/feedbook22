  <title>Perfectly Imperfect - Connie Howell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For a variety of reasons, many of us fall victim to perfectionism. A perfectionist doesnt forgive his or her own mistakes. If you are a perfectionist, you cant look away from your perceived flaws. In &lt;i&gt;Perfectly Imperfect&lt;/i&gt;, author Connie Howell offers suggestions on how to overcome the need to be perfect and how to accept yourself as being worthy of love just as you are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on her personal experiences, Howell shows that by connecting with your inner guidance and universal love, you can become more peaceful, loving, and on track to fulfill your purpose in life. &lt;i&gt;Perfectly Imperfect&lt;/i&gt; teaches the lessons: &lt;/p&gt;
 Life is like reading a book; you never know what to expect until you turn the page &lt;/br&gt;
 You already know everything you need to know, you just dont know you know&lt;/br&gt;
 Worrying about making the wrong decision is a powerful incentive to stay put and do nothing&lt;/br&gt;
 There comes a time in life when you have to be the creator rather than a spectator&lt;/br&gt;
 Show up for life, and it will surprise and delight you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howell communicates that lasting perfection doesnt exist. But, she believes in excellence and doing the best you can with the knowledge that you are already good enoughbe happy to be perfectly imperfect. &lt;/p&gt;" />
