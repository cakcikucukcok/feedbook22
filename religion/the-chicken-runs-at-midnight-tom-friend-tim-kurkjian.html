  <title>The Chicken Runs at Midnight - Tom Friend, Tim Kurkjian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most inspirational stories of sports and faith ever told,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Chicken Runs at Midnight&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;introduces us to a Major League baseball coach whose dying daughter&#39;s words changed his heart for good - and reached him in a surprising way through a World Series sign from heaven.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Major League Baseball coach, Rich Donnelly was dedicated, hardworking, and successful. But as a husband and father, he was distant, absent, and a failure. He&#39;d let baseball take over his life, and as a result his family suffered. That is, until one day his daughter called with harrowing news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dad, I have a brain tumor, and I&#39;m sorry.&quot; These words from his seventeen-year-old daughter, Amy, turned his world upside-down. Now, more than ever, he was determined to put his family first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time they spent together in the months before her death will be treasured and remembered forever, but especially the inside joke that became a catchphrase for the Donnelly family as well as the Pittsburgh Pirates team that played in the National League Championship Series that year: &quot;The chicken runs at midnight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book shares the heartwarming story behind the odd catchphrase - and how it still lives on as a symbol for never giving up&amp;mdash;and proves that God can work in the life of any person, even through their mistakes and failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaving baseball history with personal memoir, this book is one that will make you thrill to victory, believe in hope, stand up to cheer for what is good in peoples&#39; lives. It&#39;s a powerful story of redemption and faith that reminds us that God can work in our lives even when we think it&#39;s too late to change - and sometimes He sends us signs from heaven if we only have eyes to see.&lt;/p&gt;" />
