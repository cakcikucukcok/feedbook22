  <title>A Little Girl Called Squeaks - Debbie Maddigan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Little Girl Named Squeaks, is a must-read for anyone who has struggled with addiction, abuse, or feelings of worthlessness, or for anyone who wants insight into the feelings and challenges of those who struggle so. It takes place in the downtown eastside of Vancouver, BC. And it is a reminder to all of us that life stories like this should never be for children.
The saddest part is little has changed for at risk children in fifty years. Hopefully, this 
book&#39;s insights will tug at your hearts so we will become the voice of those children whose voices have been taken away.
So far this book has reached over 1,000 plus and each and everyone that has taken the time to read it has come away with something new to think about. It will show the prejudices we hold and the judgments we throw without knowing the full story of the person in front of us.
Squeaks, like most at risk children does follow in her mother&#39;s footsteps for a time, but eventually with the help of friends, Alcoholics Anonymous and God she is able to crawl out of the life-style she was so entrenched in." />
