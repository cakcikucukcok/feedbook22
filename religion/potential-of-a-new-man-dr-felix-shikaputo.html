  <title>Potential of a New Man - Dr. Felix Shikaputo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Potential for the New Man is an eye opener into what it means to be a Christian. In this inspiring book, Dr Felix Shikaputo clearly takes you step by step into Gods plan. He dispels the myth that Christianity is a religion. Many have made a religion out of Christianity but Jesus brought us something much higher than religion can offer. He brought us life and this life is capable of changing humanity into supermen. Gods dream was to bring about a New Man whose potential is connected only to divinity and capable of accomplishing supernatural things in this world. Once you discover your potential you will be on your way to greatness and success that God has destined for you in this world. This is a must book not only for ordinary Christians but leaders too.
As you read and apply the biblical teaching in Dr Felix Shikaputo&#39;s book,&#39;Potential for the New Man&#39;, you will find that your ordinary Christian life will be transformed to an extra-ordinary life. Simply put: from striving to be, to just being who you already are in Christ Jesus. You were born for a purpose and that purpose is already in your potential. All for the Glory of God!

Potential for the New Man by Dr Felix Shikaputo is a succinct account of the possibilities that can be revealed to Gods sons by His grace. It should inspire every believer to take dominion in their lives and understand who they are in Christ. Reading this well written account inspires us to live above the normal and reveal to this dying world the possibilities available as we walk with the Lord.
