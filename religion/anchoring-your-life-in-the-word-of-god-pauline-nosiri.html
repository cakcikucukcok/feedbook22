  <title>Anchoring Your Life in the Word of God - Pauline Nosiri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God shall stand forever (Isaiah 40:8, Living Bible). In this book, Pauline Nosiri reveals how the Word of God is so powerful for everyday living. The Scripture declares that the Word of God must come to pass. The Lord said to Moses, When did I become weak? Now, you shall see whether my word comes true or not! Yes, the Bible is like poetry, but the Holy Spirit will make it known to you if you decide to read it daily. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard for you to befriend someone without knowing who he is. God from the beginning wants you to come closer to Him so that you can know Him better. If you do not fall in love with God, you are not making Him number one in your life. To know Him, you have to draw near Him. You must see God through reading of His Word; see your Father through the eye of faith. &lt;p&gt;" />
