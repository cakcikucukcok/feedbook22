  <title>America’S Vision Vs. God’S Standard of Justice - Walt Thrun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book examines Gods standard of righteousness and justice as revealed to the nation of Israel and then compares those standards with Americas progressive vision. It discusses this nations three major branches of governmenti.e., executive, legislative, and judicialrelative to Americas perception of national authority and justice. It also considers specific contemporary domestic, economic, and foreign policy issues to determine if Americas priorities compare with Gods revealed standards.
A major Scripture reference will be, Now all these things happened to them (Israelites) as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come. (1 Corinthians 10:11)
A comprehensive chapter on the Middle East entitled The Fertile Crescent: Geographic Center of Prophecy presents biblical evidence that this age will end where it all began. The study also offers in this context a unique perspective on the final world kingdom based on both biblical prophecy and Islamic literature. More than five hundred Scripture passages containing more than one thousand verses are referenced and quoted from twenty-six books of the Old Testament and twenty-four books of the New Testament.
This book is ideally suited for group Bible studies in addition to enhancing individual understanding of the requirements for national success based on biblical teachings." />
