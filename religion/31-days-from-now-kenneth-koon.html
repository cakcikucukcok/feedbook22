  <title>31 Days from Now - Kenneth Koon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;31 Days from Now is a book for every man, whether you have been married for years or are soon to be married. You can benefit from Kens insights gleaned from twenty-nine years of marriage and the relationship principles from the wisdom found in the book of Proverbs. These principles, when properly applied, are transformational and can help you build the marriage you long to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31 Days from Now began as short notes to four sons from a father who transparently shares the mistakes he has made along the way and the joy he discovered in finally understanding a better waya way of relating that has taken a lifetime to learn.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you are preparing for marriage, you can avoid many of the pitfalls that newly married couples fall into. If you are one struggling to stay in your marriage, you will learn valuable principles which, when applied, can restore what is broken. The reality is 31 Days from Now is not a quick-fix, self-help book. You will be challenged to consider new ways of relating that in your own strength would be impossible. The help you need comes from the wisdom God wants to give you as you make every effort to do marriage according to the principles of biblical wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
