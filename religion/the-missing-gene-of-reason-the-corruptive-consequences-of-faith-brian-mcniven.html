  <title>The Missing Gene Of Reason - the corruptive consequences of faith - Brian McNiven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &#39;The Missing Gene of Reason&#39;, the author argues that intolerance and divisiveness that leads to conflict is due to the missing gene of reason that makes people susceptible to being indoctrinated with beliefs that originated in an era when men were less tolerant and respectful of human life.    The book provides some fascinating insights into the history and origins of Christianity and explains why the scribes who edited and compiled the New Testament were directed by Constantine to shift the blame for the execution of Christ from Rome to the Jews-an injustice that resulted in the persecution of Jews.   Because secular morality has brought about dramatic changes to our values since the era of the biblical myths when Moses devised God&#39;s laws, observance of most of God&#39;s laws is now called murder.   In saying he has never met a Christian who wasn&#39;t a heretic, the author points out that people who call themselves Christians no longer respect God&#39;s biblical laws that demand the stoning to death of homosexuals, disobedient sons, women who have sex before marriage, those who worship a God of a different faith and those who work on God&#39;s Sabbath of Saturday.     In stating that without reason we are but a rudderless vessel drifting on the sea of ignorance to be taken by the currents of fantasy in the direction of those we allow to determine our beliefs, the author points to the great paradox that has confounded philosophers throughout the ages. Namely, that in spite of the fact that the Bible claims that God committed genocide by drowning everyone and discredits God with its endless nauseating descriptions of his serial killings and demands that we should do likewise, Christian propaganda has succeeded in convincing their flock that the Bible is a virtuous guide by which to lead their lives.  Furthermore, the author considers that because the Bible asserts that both God and Christ approve of slavery and that God approves of a father selling his daughter as a sex slave, the Bible&#39;s justification of evil and portrayal of God as psychopathic killer has been the greatest cause of man&#39;s inhumanity to his fellow man.   The author claims that the only defense the Church can have for obeying God&#39;s demands that they kill, torture and burn heretics alive, is that God not only set the precedent when he created hell, but also prevented his believers from knowing the difference between good and evil when he denied them access to the &#39;Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil&#39; in the garden of Eden.   In providing evidence that the Church rightly considers &#39;reason&#39; to be the enemy of faith, the author argues that governments have a responsibility to promote tolerance and pacifism by requiring that taxpayer funded or subsidized schools provide students with a modern education that is free from religious divisiveness and bias against truth, reason and science.              Because the author&#39;s bases his contentions on the facts of history and what the Holy Scriptures actually say, the readers only defense is to disregard both." />
