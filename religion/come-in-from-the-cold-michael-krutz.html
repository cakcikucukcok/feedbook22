  <title>Come in from the Cold - Michael Krutz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A  journey in this life through storms, pits, and valleys . A journey in which a young man learns of trust, closeness, tenderness of love, and never ever being alone. A journey of strength and friendship. A journey in a walk with God and his Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking down the road of despair, all alone with weights I cant bear,&lt;br /&gt;
and my heart doesnt feel song, only tears come along,&lt;br /&gt;
and they call to their  friends.&lt;br /&gt;
Walking broken on my way to nowhere, wondering why am I still even here.&lt;br /&gt;
I can see clear with my eyes, but its something inside missing, dying.&lt;br /&gt;
I can see the madness of a world gone wrong,&lt;br /&gt;
they play their games and love their shame and tell the young there is no wrong,&lt;br /&gt;
while along they sing a song of sin.&lt;br /&gt;
The young are torn by drugs and hate, a media world bombards their day,&lt;br /&gt; 
electric this and electric that, instant this and instant that.&lt;br /&gt;
We move so fast almost like light, going 90 mph,&lt;br /&gt; 
instead of going forward, they were really going down.&lt;br /&gt;
A million chains lead them away.&lt;br /&gt;
The intentions of this book are to honor my Father in heaven and my Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;br /&gt;
I know what its like to be lost in this world. Come in from the cold.&lt;/p&gt;" />
