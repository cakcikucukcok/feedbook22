  <title>&#39;&#39;Amen, I Say to You&#39;&#39; - Clyde A. Bonar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amen, I Say to You includes homilies for Cycles A, B, and C of the liturgical year, and a homily for each Holy Day of Obligation within the Roman Catholic Church.  Each homily consist of three main points with supporting examples and illustrations.  These are homilies I have preached, and they have been constructed with attention to verbal presentation.  Another homilist easily should be able to substitute or include examples from his or her own pastoral or lived experience within the conceptual structure each homily provides.  
	These homilies are not essays; they include no long, convoluted, hard to understand sentences.  I try for simplicity of words and sentences, for concrete language everyone can understand.  Feedback from posting some of the homilies on the internet has characterized the homilies as well planned, with ideas placed in a logical and precise order.  They have been called simple, personal, and practical; very inspired and insightful; containing deep reflection and authentic Christian faith; and illustrative, applied and down to earth practical." />
