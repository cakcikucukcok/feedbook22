  <title>The Serpent&#39;s Seed - Joel H. Emerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE SERPENTS SEED expounds upon a Biblical doctrine that is essential for the proper understanding of both the Scriptures and the present day, but which has remained obscured for the past fifteen hundred years.  And the doctrine is this: that since the creation of man we have been at war, not only against Satan and his corruptive influences, but against the literal offspring of fallen angels and mortal women.  These hybrid creatures reigned during the days of Noah and Abraham, battled Joshua and King David for control of Israel, tormented the Jews during the time of Jesus, and continue to roam the earth even today.  Our society, even our church, has fallen under the sway of these ancient and terrible beings.  Thus The Serpents Seed was written so that we might not depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils (1st Timothy 4:1)." />
