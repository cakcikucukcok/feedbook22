  <title>The Oriental Pearl of Great Price - Millie Leng Ngoh Rook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="div&gt;
    Why does poverty live next to wealth? Why does one school child have books and the other sitting next to her does not? Why does one come to school in a big
    car with a new uniform and posh bag while the one sitting next just looks on with envy, wondering when she can have the same? Why is it so easy for one
    whilst the other struggles? This was me as a young girl in Penang!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Then everything changed when I was in Bradford, England; what and who made the amazing changes?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    This is a touching andI hopeamusing book based on my life events, from the unspoilt, tropical paradise that was Penang in the 60`s to the cold, autumn,
    grey London in the 70`s, onto the post war St. Lukes Hospital Bradford as a student nurse and then a midwife.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Alone, in foreign surroundings, with strange English foods and even stranger Yorkshire accents, my deep fear, anxieties, and insecurities were highlighted.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Moving upwards both in career and location to `Bonnie` Dundee, Scotland then to the bright northern lights of Aberdeen throughout the 80`s and 90`s shaped
    my identity with an ongoing relationship with Jesus.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Finally, I returned to Malaysia to live in one of those big houses that I enviously walked past as a child!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    You are made for wonders to possess your promises! This book will reveal and confirm that you are a precious jewel! You are His treasure of great value;
    that valuable pearl of great price!
