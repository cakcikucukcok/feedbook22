  <title>The Old Testament Speaks, Fifth Edition - Samuel J. Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here is a freshly updated edition of one of the most popular introductions to the history and literature of the Old Testament. &lt;em&gt;The Old Testament Speaks&lt;/em&gt; offers a clear picture of the archaeological, geographical, historical, and linguistic dimensions of God&amp;#39;s covenant with his people from the time of Abraham to the coming of the Messiah. &lt;em&gt;The Old Testament Speaks&lt;/em&gt; examines the historical and religious life of the Hebrews, integrates the development of non-hebraic cultures with conventional biblical history, and reviews the best modern scholarly research in placing the Scriptures in their Near Eastern setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuel J. Schultz emphasizes the importance of letting the Scriptures tell their own stories. He makes selective use of the best and latest literature in Old Testament studies, and offers a balanced perspective. Schultz sifts the facts and follows them to their inevitable conclusions. However, when the evidence is not definitive, he exercises caution, presenting his own interpretation as only one of several possible views. Schultz also appraises the impact of recent archaeological and historical findings on the understanding of key portions of the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Old Testament Speaks&lt;/em&gt; contains all the relevant material -- biblical and nonbiblical -- necessary for classroom use or personal study of the Old Testament. Schultz provides outlines that reflect the historical background and summarize the contents of each biblical book, as well as charts and maps to help visualize the biblical narrative. He has also revised and updated the biblio-graphies at the end of each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
