  <title>The Beatitudes - James A. Theodore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Beatitudes Code has been cracked! Read it here. 
God has not changed the plan of Creation. Jesus expressed his intent to re-create humankind. 
The key to understanding Jesus is to see him as Second Adam; Adam who had not fallen. Adam who walked and talked with God without any separation or sin inherited from the archangel. 
God had prepared for this moment for thousands of years. However, it was still up to the chosen and prepared people to receive the promised Messiah. 
Our first ancestors turned away from God and we must choose to come back. Jesus spells out the way to return. The Beatitudes are a map containing specific sign posts. These include, in the first phase, development of intellect, emotion, and will for the character of the individual. Following this, we find the process of ethical relationships which conclude with seeing the goodness in others. At this point Christians are qualified to be blessed in holy marriage. Such a marriage will survive and thrive forever because God is involved. The spouses see God in each other. They do not see or find Satan in their relationship. 
Upon being blessed in holy marriage, the couple are &quot;peacemakers&quot; which can only happen when the spirit of God enters the world through the united image of the Returning Christ who invites all believers to join him in the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. 
The kingdom comes from within the individual, the family, and then expands in the society. This allows for God&#39;s sovereignty on all levels both spiritually and physically. 
The Beatitudes are truly the same as the blessings given humankind expressed in Genesis 1:28 - be fruitful, multiply, and have dominion. 
The Returning Christ completes the process. 
He comes as the Bridegroom. He overcomes the fall of Adam and Eve. He opens the way to restore all things physically as well as spiritually. As the Bridegroom, he brings the holy marriage blessing which Adam and Eve did not attain. He completes the plan set out by Jesus in the Beatitudes. Amen. 
And now, we know the rest of the story. God is God of all things He created." />
