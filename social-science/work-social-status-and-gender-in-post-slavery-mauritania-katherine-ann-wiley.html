  <title>Work, Social Status, and Gender in Post-Slavery Mauritania - Katherine Ann Wiley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;1. This book is unique in the marketplace as the author is one of only a very few researchers doing work in Mauritania. It offers In-depth insight into the lives of female slave descendants in Mauritania and the work that gives their lives meaning, power, and agency.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2. This work looks at the lives of female descendants of slaves and how they negotiate their social and economic positions. It counteracts many of the negative images of Muslim women that have been reported in U.S. and European media. It gives a more nuanced view of a post-slavery society in Northwest Africa and complicates our existing understanding of this institution.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;This research introduces readers to a part of the world that remains relatively off the U.S.’s map but is of strategic interest (given the increasing threat of terrorism in this region) and that has important overlap with other countries in West and North Africa.&lt;/P&gt;" />
