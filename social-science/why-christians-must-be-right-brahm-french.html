  <title>Why Christians Must Be Right - Brahm French</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There has come a vacuum in America that has tried to eradicate God from the hearts and minds of the people. We have been told that the void that remains should be filled by government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of this nation rests in the hands of what seems to be a reluctant people, a people who are told to remain silent, who are told they are the minority, a people who are ridiculed in the public square. These are the ones for whom this book is written. The apostle Paul wrote to Timothy and instructed him to Stir up the gift of God, which is in thee  For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord (2 Timothy 1:68).&lt;/p&gt;" />
