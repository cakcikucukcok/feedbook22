  <title>Warning! Socialism Is Poison to Liberty - Charles E. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;We live in an age of relativism. Miller, a Stanford grad, class of 47, in English, asserts that he is an absolutist. That is, he has convictions. One of his convictions is that literature traces, depicts, illuminates and expounds human nature and circumstances with a profound wisdom unique to the author, not to the State. Creative literature brings to life what other men pass over as irrelevant to life. Miller is a veteran of WWII, holds a doctorate cum laud in English, and never afraid to try a new adventure. His is the pioneer spirit. e.g. new lands, more spaces, exciting opportunities, freedom. His stories reflect these qualities of character. When political correctness based on feelings and culture, it should be a relief to meet an author who deplores the lack of a will to discern truth compared to State- generated man made suppositions. Example: We cannot all possibly be equal. The latter has produced the curse of political-correctness. What has that to do with these brief narratives based on contemporary situations?
Just this: We see the latter all around us. Not so, these critiques. Intentionally of a DC culture of lies and deceptions.&quot;" />
