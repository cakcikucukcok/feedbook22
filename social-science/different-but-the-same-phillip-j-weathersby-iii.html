  <title>Different but the Same - Phillip J. Weathersby Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I am excited about the potential energy this book may generate. I have spoken with and interviewed people throughout the country in both metropolitan and rural populations. Their participation and responses have been immeasurably favorable. The majority of responses elevated my enthusiasm to indescribable heights. Because of their curiosity and extraordinary observation similarities of ethnic idiosyncrasies that paralleled years of my observation experiences, I was inclined to share what I and others have consistently discerned for your interpretation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book focuses on African-Americans and Caucasians unique and profound dissimilarities. It is what it is, pros and cons.  This discernible fact compelled me to note and list (for entertainment purposes) the dissimilarities and all of which you may be quite familiar. This book will spark perhaps duel mind sets conceivably one being innately positive and the other predictably pessimistic. I welcome both perspectives. I believe it will attract constructive dialogue that may possibly facilitate a better understanding of the two ethnic demographics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
