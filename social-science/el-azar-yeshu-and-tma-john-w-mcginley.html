  <title>El’Azar;   Yeshu; and Tma - John W. McGinley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I am projecting to my hoped audience of Jews ---and Orthodox Jews in particular--- a very different accounting of Judaism in general;  an accounting with emphasis on Scripture, first and foremost.  And then there are the more nuanced offerings of portions of our Talmud Bavli produced by those subtle final anonymous editors of our Bavli from roughly 575 to roughly 610ce.  Subtlety was the only coinage in this orchestration by the final anonymous editors.  The over-arching power of Rabbinic Officialdom could be checked only by subtle and indirect insertions into The Record by our glorious final editors of the Talmud Bavli.  God bless them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take heed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite consciously attempting to strip you of multiple presuppositions which  --  if those presuppositions permeate your reading of this production --  would give you a false understanding of what I am putting forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully realize that my presentation of these things is not the received presentation of these things.  So when you first read it you are likely to presume that I am &lt;-- like a dufus without any consciousness of such  --&gt; akin to, say, a bar Hei Hei &lt;or one of those heretics which populate so much of Genesis Rabbah&gt; thereby giving one a good conscience to quickly dismiss my accounting of things Jewish.  It is absolutely amazing how people entrenched in a received tradition do not really HEAR what is being offered to them when it comes from a perspective to which they are not habituated.  There is only one way to break that ugly danger: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;repetitio mater studiorum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;resiliationin the father of truth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it or leave it.  The burden is now on you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
