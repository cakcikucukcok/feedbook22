  <title>View from the Right, Volume I: Heritage and Foundations - Alain de Benoist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Critical Anthology of Contemporary Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;View from the Right&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in French in 1977, at the time that Alain de Benoist&amp;rsquo;s GRECE think tank was at the height of its influence. The book consists of a series of essays and profiles of various thinkers and figures who Benoist considers to embody the defining elements of the various strands of Right-wing thought. It immediately took the French political and intellectual worlds by storm, and in 1978 it was awarded the Grand Prize by the prestigious and historic French Academy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It continues to be regarded as one of the most important modern French works on political philosophy, and as being the fundamental statement of the principles of the New Right during its early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This first volume in a three-volume translation by Arktos is an encyclopedic history of ideas that addresses the philosophical, spiritual, scientific, and cultural-historical foundations of the European heritage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
