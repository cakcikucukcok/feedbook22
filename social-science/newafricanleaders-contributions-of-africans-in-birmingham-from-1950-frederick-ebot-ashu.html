  <title>Newafricanleaders Contributions of Africans in Birmingham from 1950 - Frederick Ebot Ashu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="NewAfricanLeaders interprets the heritage and history of the African community in Birmingham, United Kingdom, exploring both individual and collective achievements and contributions to the recent history of the city. Ebot Ashu researches the stories of Africans in Birmingham and provides in this volume a unique record of why they  or their parents  came to the United Kingdom, their experiences when they arrived, their subsequent experience of settlement and integration, as well as their achievements and contributions within their adopted society. It focuses on the entire African Diaspora in Birmingham and beyond. The content of this anthology is strongly international in that, while it may publish empirical research and scholarship undertaken in specific local contexts, it considers issues and themes of interest that transcend any single geographic setting. The anthology, therefore, offers an impressive collection of archival material and learning resources for this and future generations, and also serves as a testament to the increasingly diverse heritage that UK society has drawn from many different ethnic and linguistic groups, cultures and religions. In this regard this volume will be of interest to students at school and university, to their teachers and to academics as well as practitioners and policy makers in social science." />
