  <title>Journey to a Brave New World, Part Two - David Watts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his first book, &lt;i&gt;Journey to a Brave New World&lt;/i&gt;, author David Watts detailed how a small group of Satan-worshiping elites is following a multi-generational plan to manipulate humanity toward a vision outlined in Aldous Huxleys novel &lt;i&gt;Brave New World&lt;/i&gt;. In this, the second book in his series, he provides further evidence of their intentions for the United States. He has spent six years considering history, scientific research, and declassified government documents to uncover evidence to support his thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He offers evidence to prove not only the existence of civilian inmate labor camps within the United States, but also the procedures that are already in place to activate them. Details of the continued build-up and expansion of the Department of Homeland Security in readiness for the planned war against the American people are provided as well. He identifies the Trojan Horse mechanism operating to bring down the United States from within and exposes the fact that Communist troops are to be used as a final clean-up to allow globalists to introduce their solutiona one-world government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Journey to a Brave New World, Part Two&lt;/i&gt;, Watts includes a forty-five-step plan that would enable the United States to regain its former glory and ensure that the globalists do not get their brave new world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
