  <title>The Preacher and the Politician - Clarence E. Walker, Gregory D. Smithers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama’s inauguration as the first African American president
    of the United States has caused many commentators to conclude that America has entered a
    postracial age. &lt;i&gt;The Preacher and the Politician&lt;/i&gt; argues otherwise, reminding
    us that, far from inevitable, Obama’s nomination was nearly derailed by his relationship
    with Jeremiah Wright, the outspoken former pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ on the
    South Side of Chicago. The media storm surrounding Wright’s sermons, the historians
    Clarence E. Walker and Gregory D. Smithers suggest, reveals that America’s fraught racial
    past is very much with us, only slightly less obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With meticulous
    research and insightful analysis, Walker and Smithers take us back to the Democratic primary
    season of 2008, viewing the controversy surrounding Wright in the context of enduring religious,
    political, and racial dynamics in American history. In the process they expose how the
    persistence of institutional racism, and racial stereotypes, became a significant hurdle for
    Obama in his quest for the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors situate Wright&#39;s preaching
    in African American religious traditions dating back to the eighteenth century, but they also
    place his sermons in a broader prophetic strain of Protestantism that transcends racial
    categories. This latter connection was consistently missed or ignored by pundits on the right
    and the left who sought to paint the story in simplistic, and racially defined, terms.
    Obama’s connection with Wright gave rise to criticism that, according to Walker and
    Smithers, sits squarely in the American political tradition, where certain words are meant to
    incite racial fear, in the case of Obama with charges that the candidate was unpatriotic, a
    Marxist, a Black Nationalist, or a Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Obama became the Democratic
    nominee, the day of his election still saw ballot measures rejecting affirmative action and
    undermining the civil rights of other groups. The Preacher and the Politician is a concise and
    timely study that reminds us of the need to continue to confront the legacy of racism even as we
    celebrate advances in racial equality and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
