  <title>Practical Aviation &amp; Aerospace Law - Paul Hamilton, Sarah Nilsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This is the hardcover edition of this title.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Updated and expanded in its sixth edition, &lt;I&gt;Practical Aviation &amp; Aerospace Law&lt;/I&gt; (previously &lt;I&gt;Practical Aviation Law&lt;/I&gt;) and its companion workbook function as a comprehensive instructive package for undergraduate and graduate aviation law courses. Whether used as a set or alone, this book is an invaluable reference guide for aviation and aerospace business managers, pilots, maintenance personnel, aircraft owners, air traffic controllers, air safety investigators, operators of unmanned aircraft, and others involved in aviation and aerospace as a profession or hobby.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Practical Aviation &amp; Aerospace Law&lt;/I&gt; provides readers with the basic legal knowledge and perspective to understand how the legal system works in the aviation and aerospace industry. The author helps readers recognize and avoid common legal pitfalls, and enables them to recognize when they need to call a lawyer. This sixth edition is updated and expanded to reflect recent judicial decisions and changes in statutory, regulatory, and international treaty law. It covers topics surrounding the burgeoning unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and commercial spaceflight segments as well, from an increasingly global viewpoint.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In addition, Dr. Sarah Nilsson (ERAU) has contributed a new chapter discussing the historical development and current trends in spaceflight law, with an emphasis on how it affects commercial spaceflight operations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Written clearly and concisely, this book and the companion workbook provide a succinct foundation to a complex field of law. The conversational tone and frequent examples, many of them from the author&amp;#8217;s experience in practice, make this an engaging and readable resource for schools and for the industry.&lt;/div&gt;" />
