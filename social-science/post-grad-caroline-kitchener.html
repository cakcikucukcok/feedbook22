  <title>Post Grad - Caroline Kitchener</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An honest and deeply reported account of five women and the opportunities and frustrations they face in the year following their graduation from an elite university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent Princeton graduate Caroline Kitchener weaves together her experiences from her first year after college with that of four of her peers in order to delve more deeply into what the world now offers a female college graduate, and how the world perceives them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the five girls in this diverse group were expected to attend college&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/strong&gt;but most had no clear expectations for their futures post-graduation. And as Kitchener follows each member of the group, it becomes harder to reduce them to stereotypes, harder either to defend or to judge their choices. Kitchener navigates expertly between the very personal and the wider sociological perspectives as she outlines a chronological year in the lives of all five women, illuminating and clarifying each one of their choices, victories, and foibles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both a broad and an intensely individual exploration, &lt;em&gt;Post Grad&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;is a portrait of the shifting environment of that important year after graduation, as well as an intimate look at how a select group of very different individuals handles its challenges&amp;#8212;navigating family tensions, relationships, jobs, and that ever-elusive notion of independence.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
