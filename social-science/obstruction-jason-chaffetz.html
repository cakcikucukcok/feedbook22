  <title>Obstruction - Jason Chaffetz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New York Times Bestseller.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much damage will the Democrats do to our republic in the name of saving it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years he served on and eventually chaired the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Jason Chaffetz gained crucial insight into the inner workings of D.C. Things were bad then, but during the Trump administration, liberals have reached a new level of hysteria and misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrat anger has grown so irrational that it has burst through the constitutional guardrails which protect our institutions and our republic. While they constantly label the right “fascist,” the left imposes policies which suppress speech, limit freedom, and empower federal bullies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Power Grab&lt;/em&gt;, Chaffetz pulls back the curtain on the world of hypocrisy, political intrigue, and procedural malfeasance that is Washington D.C. With stories you won&#39;t read anywhere else, he shows how the left weaves false narratives, drums up investigations in search of a crime, and refuses to direct congressional oversight towards its appropriate target: the government. Democrats weaponize nonprofit advocacy groups and monetize partisan anger to line the pockets of their political allies. They use “voter enrollment” as a smokescreen to hide their plans to destabilize free elections and seek to politicize federal agencies like the Federal Election Commission, the IRS, and the Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t be this way. Democrats have abandoned the wisdom set forth in the Constitution for short-term political wins. &lt;em&gt;Power Grab&lt;/em&gt; shows the lengths to which Democrats will go to maintain their grip on power, and how the only thing that will stop them is a return to our founding principles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
