  <title>How to Solve Problems Using the Constitution - John Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How to solve problems using the Constitution. Is a book promotes US citizens to run for public office while explaining to the readers how to solve the major problems that are facing the US population. The book goes through almost every issue that is facing the United States from Global Warming to the Student Debt Crises. Issues like the 2nd amendment, gay marriage, bailouts and the collapse of the economy. How to solve problems using the constitution takes the reader through different issues, while explaining history of the United States where there might have been similar problems then. How did Washington solve the debt crisis from the revolutionary war? We have a debt crisis today. How can we use history to solve our problems today? What does it mean to be an American vs a British Subject? How did the United States become the power house that it is today? Why is it so hard to live in the United States? What is constitutional and what is not constitutional? This book is designed to educate the reader on running for office and solving our problems like the constitution was designed for. Solving our problems diplomatically, using our laws to raise the stand of living for the common man. Only you can run for office and work within our government to change things for the good.  Our politicians are invested in themselves. Our politicians are going to do what they are told by the people who finance their campaigns. That is why you need to run for political office and that is why I wrote this book. Hopefully I might have enough money to run for office one day. I hope that this book motivates you, the reader to be self-confident embracing your democratic republican responsibilities and run for office. I hope that I create an army of responsible democratic republican civilians that take their government back from the Special interests, lobbyists and the foreign governments that are controlling the United States of America today." />
