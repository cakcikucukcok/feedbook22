  <title>Gertrude Weil - Leonard Rogoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is so obvious that to treat people equally is the right thing to do,&quot; wrote Gertrude Weil (1879&amp;ndash;1971). In the first-ever biography of Weil, Leonard Rogoff tells the story of a modest southern Jewish woman who, while famously private, fought publicly and passionately for the progressive causes of her age.  Born to a prominent family in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Weil never married and there remained ensconced--in many ways a proper southern lady--for nearly a century. From her hometown, she fought for women&#39;s suffrage, founded her state&#39;s League of Women Voters, pushed for labor reform and social welfare, and advocated for world peace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weil made national headlines during an election in 1922 when, casting her vote, she spotted and ripped up a stack of illegally marked ballots. She campaigned against lynching, convened a biracial council in her home, and in her eighties desegregated a swimming pool by diving in headfirst. Rogoff also highlights Weil&#39;s place in the broader Jewish American experience. Whether attempting to promote the causes of southern Jewry, save her European family members from the Holocaust, or support the creation of a Jewish state, Weil fought for systemic change, all the while insisting that she had not done much beyond the ordinary duty of any citizen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
