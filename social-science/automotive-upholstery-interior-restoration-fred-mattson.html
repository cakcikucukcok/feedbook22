  <title>Automotive Upholstery &amp; Interior Restoration - Fred Mattson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After disassembling and gutting your car, it is easy to feel that you&#39;re in way over your head when it comes to the upholstery. This is why so many do-it-yourself restorers outsource the work, at considerable expense, to an experienced upholstery shop. Taking the time to acquire the skills for upholstery restoration may feel like a daunting task, but what if an experienced upholsterer presented every skill you needed to restore upholstery yourself?&lt;p&gt;Starting with a list of necessary tools, author Fred Mattson guides you through all the required tasks, including seat restoration; door panel removal, patterning, assembly, and installation; headliner removal and installation; carpet cutting; and even convertible top restoration. The easy-to-follow step-by-step presentation allows for a thorough understanding of all the processes. Every photo in this book provides a hands-on approach that shows you how to repair and restore a car’s interior to concours, show-quality specifications.&lt;p&gt;Other restoration books may show you beautifully restored interiors, but they don&#39;t show you how to produce them. This book helps you develop the skills needed with instruction from a professional upholsterer, saving you thousands of dollars over outsourcing the restoration. If you are interested in saving money, doing a complete restoration yourself, or simply want to know how it&#39;s done, this book is a handy addition to your automotive library." />
