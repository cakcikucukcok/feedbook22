  <title>Spring Break Adventures: Karen and Susan Take On Two Submissive Co-eds Volume 1 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Susan put the laptop down in front of Brenda and Kelly. She began showing them her slideshow of the photos of the night before. Susan had Photoshopped them a little, but they still looked very real and legitimate. The girls jaws dropped and they were horrified at what they saw.    &quot;Buuu... but...&quot; Brenda stammered. &quot;Are those us in those pictures?&quot;    &quot;Yes. See? I blew some of them up and you can clearly see your faces.&quot; Susan smiled. &quot;Kelly, you were delicious by the way.&quot;    Kelly began to feel sick to her stomach and like she was going to lose her breakfast she had just eaten. Once Susan had gone through the photos, Karen began to speak. &quot;This is how this is all going to play out. Susan here had gone into each of your cell phones and accessed your Facebook pages and e-mail and changed your passwords. These photos will be posted all over your Facebook pages and sent out to all your contacts in your e-mails, unless you do exactly what we tell you to do and play our game." />
