  <title>Shamans of San Damiano - J. Lamah Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Truly All-American
 Renaissance Prophet
	Even without any actual historical references, Lamah contends that the contents of this narrative is a true story in reality.  And after all, what is reality?
This poignant book is, in essence, a story that is all about the power and significance of love. It begins at the closing years of the 18th century and has its final installment of inspirational spiritual muse manifested during the early to mid-19th Century. The source of this loving tale is an earthbound disembodied soul of unprecedented spiritual substance, who remained in spirit close to the geographic origins of this prophetic story until the end of the 20th Century. It was then that several conspiring, sometimes tragic circumstances brought together two initiate, spiritually gifted Medicine Men whose lives in this Garden of Eden were necessarily separated by the passage of more than a hundred years. They would dedicate their modest lives to the healing of others spirits through that immutable power of love, a love that was and should always remain necessarily unconditional, and always boundless." />
