  <title>Soulless - Susan Estrich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &quot;A word to those of you out there who have yet to be offended by something I have written or said: Please be patient. I am working as fast as I can.&quot; &amp;#8211;Ann Coulter, 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is she ever!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the publication of her Clinton-bashing debut, &lt;em&gt;High Crimes and Misdemeanors&lt;/em&gt;, right-wing fire-brand Ann Coulter has made herself one of the most talked-about figures in contemporary American life&amp;#8212;and has done so by issuing a near-continuous barrage of insult and invective, which has been described as &quot;shameless,&quot; &quot;cruel,&quot; &quot;shrill, bombastic, and mean-spirited,&quot; &quot;grossly inappropriate,&quot; &quot;hate speech.&quot; She has called the 9/11 widows &quot;witches&quot; and &quot;harpies,&quot; referred to Muslims as &quot;ragheads,&quot; called Al Gore a &quot;total fag,&quot; and said that both &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; editor Bill Keller and antiwar congressman Jack Murtha deserved to die. Yet with each new statement&amp;#8212;and each new book launch&amp;#8212;Coulter somehow manages to co-opt the media as a megaphone for her attacks, while emerging from the backlash miraculously unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now. With &lt;em&gt;Soulless&lt;/em&gt;, political commentator Susan Estrich takes on Ann and the &quot;Coulter culture&quot; she has created, exposing how the pundit &lt;em&gt;provocatrice&lt;/em&gt; has downgraded our political discourse with her irresponsible rhetoric, personal attacks, and slanderous asides. Trawling through Coulter&#39;s history of often-violent public statements, Estrich asks which are more cynical: the pundit and her headline-grabbing drive-by character assassinations, or the networks who happily bring her back for more. &lt;em&gt;Soulless&lt;/em&gt; also casts a light on &quot;the Anns,&quot; wannabes like Michelle Malkin and Glenn Beck, whose imitation Coulterisms coarsen our culture with every passing news cycle. And, most important, she challenges us&amp;#8212;the readers, the voters&amp;#8212;to remember that behind the huckster&#39;s rhetoric lurks a dangerous reactionary whose real agenda is wildly out of step with the American public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Estrich says, &quot;She knows exactly what she is doing. And she is scary as hell because of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
