  <title>Understanding Namibia - Henning Melber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since independence in 1990, Namibia has witnessed only one generation with no memory of colonialism - the &#39;born frees&#39;, who voted in the 2009 elections. The anti-colonial liberation movement, SWAPO, dominates the political scene, effectively making Namibia a de facto one-party state dominated by the first &#39;struggle generation&#39;.
While those in power declare their support for a free, fair, and just society, the limits to liberation are such that emancipation from foreign rule has only been partially achieved. Despite its natural resources Namibia is among the world&#39;s most unequal societies and indicators of wellbeing have not markedly improved for many among the former colonized majority, despite a constitution enshrining human rights, social equality, and individual liberty.
This book analyses the transformation of Namibian society since Independence. Melber explores the achievements and failures and contrasts the narrative of a post-colonial patriotic history with the socio-economic and political realities of the nation-building project. He also investigates whether, notwithstanding the relative stability prevailing to date, the negotiation of controlled change during Namibia&#39;s decolonization could have achieved more than simply a change of those in control." />
