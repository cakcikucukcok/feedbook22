  <title>What Are We To Do With Our Lives? - H. G. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This vintage book contains H. G. Wells&#39;s &quot;The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution&quot; (first published in 1928). Wells describes the book as a &#39;scheme to thrust forward and establish a human control over the destinies of life, and liberate it from its present dangers, uncertainties and miseries.&#39; The text suggests that, thanks to scientific advancement, a world &#39;politically, socially and economically unified&#39; is being established by educated and influential people which could be the foundation of &#39;a world revolution aiming at universal peace.&#39; This fascinating and thought-provoking treatise will appeal to those with an interest in utopian literature, and it is not to be missed by fans and collectors of Wells&#39;s work. Herbert George Wells (1866 - 1946) was a seminal English writer whose notable works include &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1897) and &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895). Many antiquarian texts such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this book now, in an affordable, high-quality, modern edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned biography of the author." />
