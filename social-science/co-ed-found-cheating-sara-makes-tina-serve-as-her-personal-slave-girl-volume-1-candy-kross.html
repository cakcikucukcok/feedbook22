  <title>Co-Ed Found Cheating: Sara Makes Tina Serve as Her Personal Slave Girl Volume 1 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;No, that is not why. It&#39;s because I am a lesbian. I love women. Sexy, beautiful and hot women like you.&quot; Sara smiled and kneeled down on the floor next to Tina and began caressing her skin. &quot;With soft skin...&quot;  .........................................................................    Tina came into the kitchen where Sara was. She was wearing a little miniskirt with a tight top. She always dressed sexy and aroused men whenever she passed them. Sara looked at her and shook her head. &quot;We&#39;re going to Wal-Mart, I need to pick up a few things, but I think you are overdressed.&quot; She pointed at Tina&#39;s outfit. &quot;I only want you to wear a thong and a bra and your high heels when we go out to the store.&quot; She grinned at Tina.    &quot;Wha... what?&quot; Tina asked surprised.    &quot;You heard me. Now strip. I know you are wearing a thong underneath that skirt. I know what a little slut you are.&quot;    Tina stripped her skirt and top off and was standing in her red thong and red lace bra, with her red six inch heels." />
