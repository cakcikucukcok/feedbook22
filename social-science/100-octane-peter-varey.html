  <title>100-octane - Peter Varey</title>

This is the fuel which powered&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;new high-compression engines of&amp;nbsp;US fighter aircraft&amp;nbsp;from 1937 and later the Merlin engines which helped the RAF&amp;#39;s Spitfires and Hurricanes survive the Battle of Britain in 1940.&amp;nbsp;All three men worked in the United States in the 1930s and their ideas came together to produce 100-octane gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herman Pines, newly arrived from Poland via Lyon, France, found work hard to come by until he&amp;nbsp;joined&amp;nbsp;Universal Oil Products in Chicago in 1930 as a temporary laboratory assistant, He&amp;nbsp;made a key observation soon afterwards. Experienced Russian chemist Vladimir Ipatieff joined him, and the two worked on previously unknown transformations of petroleum to create&amp;nbsp;very high octane (and very expensive)&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;alkylates&amp;quot;. They faced personal as well as technical challenges. Ipatieff was chased by Stalin&amp;#39;s agents to return to the Soviet Union; Pines could only watch, helpless, as his family in Poland became&amp;nbsp;trapped in ghettos and were exterminated by the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houdry&amp;#39;s challenges were technical and financial. In France he had discovered&amp;nbsp;a new process which produced, using a catatyst, a gasoline of 80-octane&amp;nbsp;in a single step from petroleum. This was ideal for topping up to 100-octane with Ipatieff and Pines&amp;#39;s alkylates. Looking for a backer to provide his&amp;nbsp;development costs, Houdry&amp;nbsp;found one in the United States. With preparations for war, the money for both Houdry&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;gasoline and Ipatieff and Pines&amp;#39; alkylates became more available and economies of scale saw prices drop.&amp;nbsp;By 1940 the British government had persuaded the Americans to supply the RAF with 100-octane fuel and as a result Hurricanes and Spitfires were able to hold&amp;nbsp;off a technically-superior foe.&amp;nbsp;Today the&amp;nbsp;work of these three men still forms the basis of high-octane gasoline at high-street pumps.&lt;/p&gt;" />
