  <title>Working Scottish Trucks - Ian Lawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Working Scottish Trucks is a photographic book bringing together 262 images of commercial vehicles spotted across some of the most scenic parts of Scotland. The beautiful landscapes offer a fantastic backdrop to the large range of haulage companies based in this rural, rugged and often difficult area. With just one picture per page, this book reproduces Ian Lawson&#39;s perfectly captured shots to maximum effect. The images have been taken over 30 years of dedicated viewing and focus on 10 types of vehicles - bulk transport, curtainsiders, fridges and food, general haulage, hay and stray, heavy haulage, livestock transporters, renewable energy transport, round timber haulage and tankers. Each photo is captioned with the date, location, make and model of vehicle and details of owner and types of work undertaken. The distinctive and unashamedly patriotic look of Scottish liveries has always attracted a strong following and so Working Scottish Trucks is a must-have for transport enthusiasts within Scotland, the UK and beyond." />
