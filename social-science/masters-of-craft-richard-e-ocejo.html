  <title>Masters of Craft - Richard E. Ocejo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In today&#39;s new economy&amp;#8212;in which &quot;good&quot; jobs are typically knowledge or technology based&amp;#8212;many well-educated and culturally savvy young people are instead choosing to pursue traditionally low-status manual labor occupations as careers. &lt;i&gt;Masters of Craft&lt;/i&gt; looks at the renaissance of four such trades: bartending, distilling, barbering, and butchering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this in-depth and engaging book, Richard Ocejo takes you into the lives and workplaces of these people to examine how they are transforming these once-undesirable jobs into &quot;cool&quot; and highly specialized upscale occupational niches&amp;#8212;and in the process complicating our notions about upward and downward mobility through work. He shows how they find meaning in these jobs by enacting a set of &quot;cultural repertoires,&quot; which include technical skills based on a renewed sense of craft and craftsmanship and an ability to understand and communicate that knowledge to others, resulting in a new form of elite taste-making. Ocejo describes the paths people take to these jobs, how they learn their chosen trades, how they imbue their work practices with craftsmanship, and how they teach a sense of taste to their consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on cocktail bartenders, craft distillers, upscale men&#39;s barbers, and whole-animal butcher shop workers in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and upstate New York, &lt;i&gt;Masters of Craft&lt;/i&gt; provides new insights into the stratification of taste, gentrification, and the evolving labor market in today&#39;s postindustrial city.&lt;/p&gt;" />
