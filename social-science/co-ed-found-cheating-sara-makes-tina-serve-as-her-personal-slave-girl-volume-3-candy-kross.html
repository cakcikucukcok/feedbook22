  <title>Co-Ed Found Cheating: Sara Makes Tina Serve as Her Personal Slave Girl Volume 3 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sara had another idea of how to humiliate Tina. &quot;Did you pee while you were in the bathroom?&quot;    &quot;What?&quot; Tina asked.    &quot;You heard me. Did you take a pee while you were inside the bathroom?&quot; Sara asked her again.    &quot;No. Why?&quot; Tina was wondering why Sara was asking her that question.    &quot;I think you should go pee now.&quot; Sara ordered her.    &quot;Well, we&#39;re away from the bathroom now. I can go after class. It can wait.&quot; Tina said, oblivious to what Sara was thinking.  &quot;I think you should go now.&quot; Sara insisted.    &quot;Sara, I told you that it can wait.&quot; Tina was getting frustrated with Sara&#39;s persistence.     &quot;I think you should go right over there.&quot; Sara pointed over to some nearby bushes.    &quot;But, there isn&#39;t a bathroom there.&quot; Tina said.    &quot;I think you should squat over there and pee.&quot; Sara said again.    Then it hit Tina. Sara wanted her to actually pee in public! Oh my god! Tina thought to herself. She had never peed in public before, let alone on a college campus..." />
