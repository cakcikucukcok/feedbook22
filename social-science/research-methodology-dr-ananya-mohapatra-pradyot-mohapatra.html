  <title>Research Methodology - Dr Ananya Mohapatra, Pradyot Mohapatra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Research Methodology A Handbook is designed as a short introduction to the subject. It is eminently practical in nature. Conceptual issues confusing the research scholar have been dealt with in a lucid manner. The authors believe that even in the social sciences the mechanical or quantitative dimension should precede the sociological dimension. Before the social scientist begins to deal with verbal categories such as role, status, institution, etc, he should be in a position to appreciate the mechanical dimension. Familiarity with the mechanical dimension makes it possible for the research scholar to appreciate the fact that even when the dimension is sociological, the elements of science such as validity and reproducibility come to the fore. The book is based on material published over the last hundred years and the authors believe that the social sciences where cause and effect can still be separated in experienced time have not moved much beyond where they were several years ago." />
