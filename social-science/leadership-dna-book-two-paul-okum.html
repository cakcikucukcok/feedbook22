  <title>Leadership Dna, Book Two - Paul Okum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first book, Leadership DNA examined the false premise that anyone can be a leader.
Paul Okum, a former US Army officer who has held numerous executive positions with the federal government, builds upon those insights in this second book, sharing techniques to identify, select, and help born leaders enhance their skills.
He explores how good leaders effectively overcome forty different types of challenges through short essays. Learn how to
	avoid one-size-fits-all formulas;
	use innate talents to deal with and solve challenges;
	embrace the art of leadership over the science of leadership; and
	weave a message of hope and confidence that others can embrace.
Okum also explains what leadership isnttoppling the arguments of leadership gurus who argue that leadership can be managed. The problem with that approach, he says, is that you cannot choreograph a leaders response to a wide range of human activity and organizational change. You cannot view leadership like a scientific calculation where adherence to formulas equals good leadership.
Whether youre a politician, business executive, or concerned citizen, youll be empowered to accomplish objectives with the insights in the second book of 
Leadership DNA." />
