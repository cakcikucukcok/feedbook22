      <meta name="description" content="Along with General Claire Chennault&#39;s &quot;Flying Tigers,&quot; the men and planes of the 490th Bomb Squadron became famous as the &quot;Burma Bridge Busters.&quot; From late 1942 to the end of the war, their incredible feats of low-level bombing and strafing of Japanese-held bridges, airfields, and troop facilities in occupied Burma hindered the Japanese advance in Asia, and provided critical air support for the allies fighting on the ground. The author&#39;s uncle, a radioman/waist gunner in the 490th, was killed on a mission in the waning days of the war. This book is both a search for his memory, and a tribute to the squadron in which he proudly served and sacrificed his lifethe &quot;Burma Bridge Busters.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
The author was born and raised in Chicago. In addition to writing and traveling, he is an avid fisherman, hunter, and scuba diver. He has published Seasons of Harvest, a three-volume historical novel, and is at work on a second novel titled Cumberland Road. This book is his first nonfiction work." />
