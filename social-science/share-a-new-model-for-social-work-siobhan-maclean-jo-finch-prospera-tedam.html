  <title>Share - A New Model for Social Work - Siobhan Maclean, Jo Finch, Prospera Tedam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written by three social work educators with over 70 years&#39; experience of social work practice and education between them. Concerned about the profession of social work in the UK, the authors have devised a new model of social work called &#39;SHARE&#39;. As the book discusses, one of the key drivers in developing the SHARE model was ensuring that the diversity of voices in social work are heard, including practitioners, service users and carers, experts by experience, managers, academics and many others. Unusually, the book contains the voices of over 40 social work stakeholders and the authors &#39;share&#39; their own experiences. The SHARE model, as the book explores, aims at re-orientating social work back to a more emancipatory and shared position. The SHARE model is designed around five distinct yet connected components, which the book explores: SEEING HEARING ACTION READING EVAUATION The SHARE model can be applied in any social work (and indeed comparator) practice and education setting and the final chapter illustrates the way that the SHARE model can be used in social work practice, supervision and practice education. The book is written in an engaging and highly accessible way, whilst ensuring that the issues covered are given the necessary depth of exploration. The book is research informed and utilises a wide range of theory. As visual learners and proponents of creative methods in social work practice and education, the authors have ensured the book is creative and participatory. The book is intended to be written in!" />
