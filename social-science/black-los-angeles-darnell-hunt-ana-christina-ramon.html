  <title>Black Los Angeles - Darnell Hunt, Ana-Christina Ramon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles is well-known as a temperate paradise with expansive beaches and mountain vistas, a booming luxury housing market, and the home of glamorous Hollywood. During the first half of the twentieth century, Los Angeles was also seen as a mecca for both African Americans and a steady stream of migrants from around the country and the world, transforming Los Angeles into one of the world&amp;#8217;s most diverse cities. The city has become a multicultural maze in which many now fear that the political clout of the region&amp;#8217;s large black population has been lost. Nonetheless, the dream of a better life lives on for black Angelenos today, despite the harsh social and economic conditions many confront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Black Los Angeles&lt;/b&gt; is the culmination of a groundbreaking research project from the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA that presents an in-depth analysis of the historical and contemporary contours of black life in Los Angeles. Based on innovative research, the original essays are multi-disciplinary in approach and comprehensive in scope, connecting the dots between the city&amp;#8217;s racial past, present, and future. Through historical and contemporary anecdotes, oral histories, maps, photographs, illustrations, and demographic data, we see that Black Los Angeles is and has always been a space of profound contradictions. Just as Los Angeles has come to symbolize the complexities of the early twenty-first-century city, so too has Black Los Angeles come to embody the complex realities of race in so-called &amp;#8220;colorblind&amp;#8221; times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contributors:&lt;/b&gt; Melina Abdullah, Alex Alonso, Dionne Bennett, Joshua Bloom, Edna Bonacich, Scot Brown, Reginald Chapple, Lola Smallwood Cuevas, Andrew Deener, Regina Freer, Jooyoung Lee, Mignon R.
