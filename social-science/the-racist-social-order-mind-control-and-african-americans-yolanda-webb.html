  <title>The Racist Social Order, Mind Control, and African Americans - Yolanda Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The divisions within colonized groups are often manifestations of a system designed to perpetuate racism and discrimination. Hierarchical systems of oppression have historically been created to maintain confusion and division. Whats more, media images have often been used as tools to support a colonial agenda so that certain groups remain under subjugationa type of psychological warfare intended to decrease the chances of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to this context, The Racist Social Order, Mind Control, and African Americans presents a collection of revolutionary poetry and historical facts designed to evoke critical thinking regarding issues of social inequities. Author Yolanda Webb shares her thoughts and reflections in an attempt to create solutions designed to deconstruct these inequities, a necessity if we are to move toward a more democratic society. She also writes on psychology inspired by research and featuring historical facts relating to a racial hierarchy intended to create division among colonized groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a type of cross-cultural dialogue that provokes both reflection and cognitive dissonance, this collection encourages resistance in order to allow the beginning of the creation of pathways for improvements for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
