  <title>Democracy: the Con of the Century - G.M Solon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Solons merit is his insight into our system of government and his ability to strip away the programming and false culture that bedevils our freedom. While Solon is well educated and well read, it is the emphasis on thinking based in relation to experience and not on the opinion of others that is crucial to any kind of liberation. Solon has never been involved in party politics and is not pushing anybodys agenda or promoting revolution. He is the ordinary man in the street who sees what he should be subject to. Political change, however, is necessary if we are to gain most from our society. That change is the change to mass consent and not the dictatorship we have at present or in any of its guises that a power group may wish to manufacture.
What is democracy? Why are we conned into believing we have democracy when we dont? What tyrannies are going on and have gone on are addressed and explained.
If you are fed up with the political system and the lying incompetent politicians, if you feel abused by the law, legal system, and the arms of government, you are not alone but a part of the majority. If you want to clarify why that is so along with where hope lies in the future, then read this book." />
