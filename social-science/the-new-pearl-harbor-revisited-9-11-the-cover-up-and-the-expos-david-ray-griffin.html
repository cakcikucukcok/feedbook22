  <title>The New Pearl Harbor Revisited: 9/11, the Cover-Up, and the Expos - David Ray Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In 2004, David Ray Griffin published The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions about the Bush Administration and 9/11. Translated into several languages, it helped spark a worldwide movement demanding &quot;9/11 truth.&quot; Even as it became increasingly outdated, it continued to be widely cited as the best introduction to the issues.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Griffin has now written The New Pearl Harbor Revisited, which provides a chapter-by-chapter updating of the information provided in that earlier book.  It shows that the case against the official account constructed by independent researchers - who now include architects, engineers, physicists, pilots, politicians, and former military officers - is far stronger than it was in 2004, leaving no doubt that 9/11 was a false-flag operation, designed to give the Bush-Cheney administration a pretext to attack oil-rich Muslim nations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Taken together, these two books provide everything one needs to make an informed decision about 9/11 - whether one is a journalist, a political leader, a religious leader, or an ordinary citizen concerned about truth, democracy, and the rule of law.&lt;/div&gt;" />
