  <title>Why Leaders Fail and Plunge the Innocent into a Sea of Agonies - Agola Auma-Osolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a diagnosis of the cause-effects of leadership failure endemic that has often plunged the innocent mankind globally into a sea of various agonies throughout all generations. Because of the criticality of the failures of leadership and the crucial aim of science and professional ethic to save humanity from every danger of insecurity, the book employs an interdisciplinary approach in order to not only achieve the aim but also be exhaustively thorough vis--vis the identity and behavior of the mysteries surrounding the root cause of this particular problem that seems to have always evaded full recognition of previous etiological efforts. It does so in order that the root cause may no longer continue to cause further havoc to humanity with total impunity. On the strength of this approach, and also being cognizant to the fact that man always perishes due to either lack of knowledge or to his despise of knowledge (Hosea 4:6), the book discovers that since antiquity during our patriarch Adam to the present, agonies of destruction of life, property, and the environment caused by leadership, poverty abound and is globally increasing very alarmingly on the equal proportion with the growth of our civilization, which could easily lead to a global catastrophethe given presence of the monuclear weaponry. These agonies arise from intra- and interstate strifes and displaced persons exodus madly in search of a safe haven, kleptocracy, justice sale contrary to a leaders oath of office and professional ethics, etc., which consequently leads to the innocents frustration, anger, and retaliation in the form of strikes, terrorism, coup detat, etc., against the source of their frustration. But although mankind has, to date, achieved commendable discoveries in both bioscience and physical science for reliable remedies to human agonies caused by both natural and man-made disasters, unfortunately, such substantive achievements have not been witnessed in both social and behavioral sciences against the root cause of bad governance, which has been the principal causal factor to perpetual man-made agonies to humanity. Consequently, from its etiology of this bad governance, the book unearths mans habitual dishonesty and disobedience to his own oath of office and Gods commandment to every leader contained in the Holy Bible under 2 Samuel 23:24, ordering that one must be just to all that one rules over in conformity to ones oath of office as actual root causes. The book confirms these as being responsible for all leadership failures ranging from the patriarch Adams leadership to leadership failures of various kingdoms of Old Israel and during our own generation today. The latter include the colonial leaders followed by leaders of independent Africa who, like Judas Iscariot, paradoxically continue to betray and sentence their innocent African continent people to perpetual agonies of poverty, diseases, corruption, and other various symptoms of underdevelopment and dependency in a contravention of their own original promises during their struggle for independence from colonialism and imperialism, and also their own vow during their oath of office as leaders of Independent Africa. Thus, the significance of this book to both academia and total humanity for their etiological efforts against the vice." />
