  <title>God and Hillary Clinton - Paul Kengor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For nearly three decades political observers have sought to understand the complex relationship between Hillary Clinton&#39;s faith and her politics. Now, in this first spiritual biography of the former first lady, acclaimed historian Paul Kengor sets out to answer the elusive question: What does Hillary Clinton believe? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on exhaustive research, &lt;em&gt;God and Hillary Clinton&lt;/em&gt; tells the surprising story of Hillary&#39;s spiritual evolution, detailing the interaction between her lifelong religious beliefs and her personal history that has made her the politician she is today. Offering an in-depth spiritual chronology of Clinton&#39;s life, author Paul Kengor also analyzes the fraught relationship between her faith and her secular policies&amp;#8212;most notably how she reconciles her pro-choice stance on abortion with her Christian beliefs&amp;#8212;and scrutinizes how these policies have changed over the course of her political career. What emerges is an unexpected portrait of a political figure whose ideals have been shaped by both the power of her politics and the depth of her religious devotion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
