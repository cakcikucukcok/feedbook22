  <title>Everyday Transgressions - Adelle Blackett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Adelle Blackett tells the story behind the International Labour Organization&#39;s (ILO) Decent Work for Domestic Workers Convention No. 189, and its accompanying Recommendation No. 201 which in 2011 created the first comprehensive international standards to extend fundamental protections and rights to the millions of domestic workers laboring in other peoples&#39; homes throughout the world. As the principal legal architect, Blackett is able to take us behind the scenes to show us how Convention No. 189 transgresses the everyday law of the household workplace to embrace domestic workers&#39; human rights claim to be both workers like any other, and workers like no other. In doing so, she discusses the importance of understanding historical forms of invisibility, recognizes the influence of the domestic workers themselves, and weaves in poignant experiences, infusing the discussion of laws and standards with intimate examples and sophisticated analyses. Looking to the future, she ponders how international institutions such as the ILO will address labor market informality alongside national and regional law reform. Regardless of what comes next, &lt;I&gt;Everyday Transgressions&lt;/I&gt; establishes that domestic workers&#39; victory is a victory for the ILO and for all those who struggle for an inclusive, transnational vision of labor law, rooted in social justice.&lt;/P&gt;" />
