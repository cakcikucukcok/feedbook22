  <title>Homosexuality - Luby Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the image of God created him; male and female created he them . . . God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply . . . replenish the earth (Genesis 1:27, 28). 
Furthermore, in Leviticus 20:13, it states, If a man also lie, with mankind, as he lieth with a woman . . . an abomination . . . surely be put to death. Any sin in the Bible that carries a death penalty causes severe harm to a society. When both the Old Testament and the New Testament are against a behavior, there is no statute of limitation on Gods Word.
Same-sex couples have no business raising children. Because, whether you are gay or straight, it takes a male and female to birth a child. Same-sex marriage is a choice. When you force a child to indulge your homosexual choice, you take away their choice to be straight or gay. This is also the start of bad parenting. Choice is what separates us from the animals.
Every unsolved local court case that attracts national attention cannot be solved by the Supreme Court. Declaring the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional and legalizing same-sex marriage is one of such cases. Our present form of government was not designed to handle a controversial issue like this. Nine people (Supreme Court judges) cannot determine the fate of more than 350 million people when the legalization of same-sex marriage violates the laws of God and nature. Not to mention, the many religions and cultures that the Supreme Court ruling affects. That ruling must be overturned. To prove this, let the facts in this book be presented to a candid world." />
