  <title>Dominant Wives Society and Their Cuckold Husbands Volume 7 Thru 9 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I had awakened from my nap a few hours later to find that I was tied up to our bed!     &quot;Lucy!&quot; I yelled out. &quot;Lucy!&quot; I waited for her to come inside the room, but nothing. &quot;Lucy! Where are you?!&quot; She had tied me really good to our bedposts. My ankles and wrists were tightly secured with silk ropes. I pulled my wrists and ankles and nothing. I was bound and I soon realized that I wasn&#39;t going anywhere.     About fifteen minutes later, Lucy walked into the bedroom wearing a tight red dress with a plunging back and her cleavage showing. It was a tight number too and I could see every curve of her body. She looked amazingly hot!     &quot;What the hell Lucy?!&quot; I yelled at her, still trying to get free but with no success.     Lucy sat on the edge of the bed and crossed her legs. I could see that she had on a pair of six inch stiletto heels on. &quot;What&#39;s the matter baby?&quot; She teased me. &quot;You don&#39;t like me being in charge do you?&quot; She ran her long red painted fingernails alongside my cheek on my face." />
