  <title>The Narrative of the Life Of Frederick Douglass - Frederick Douglass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Former slave, impassioned abolitionist, brilliant writer, newspaper editor and eloquent orator whose speeches fired the abolitionist cause, Frederick Douglass led an astounding life. Physical abuse, deprivation and tragedy plagued his early years, yet through sheer force of character he was able to overcome these obstacles to become a leading spokesman for his people.&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, Douglass provides graphic descriptions of his childhood and horrifying experiences as a slave as well as a harrowing record of his dramatic escape to the North and eventual freedom. Generally held to be the most famous piece written by a former slave, The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is a memoir on abolition written by the famous orator. First published in 1845, it set the tone for the American abolitionist movement. Within four months, it sold more than 5,000 copies; within fifteen years, it sold 30,000.&lt;br /&gt;
The eleven chapters in The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass not only recount Douglass&amp;#39; life as a slave, but his tremendous ambition to become a free man.&lt;br /&gt;
The Narrative is admired today for its extraordinary passion, sensitive and vivid descriptions and storytelling power. This book belongs in the library of anyone interested in African-American history and the life of one of the country&amp;#39;s most courageous and influential champions of civil rights. This amazing work that sparked a historical movement is presented in a beautifully bound, easy to read edition.&lt;/p&gt;" />
