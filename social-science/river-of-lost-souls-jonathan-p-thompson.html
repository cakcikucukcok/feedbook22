  <title>River of Lost Souls - Jonathan P. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award&amp;#150;winning investigative environmental journalist Jonathan P. Thompson digs into the science, politics, and greed behind the 2015 Gold King Mine disaster, and unearths a litany of impacts wrought by a century and a half of mining, energy development, and fracking in southwestern Colorado. Amid these harsh realities, Thompson explores how a new generation is setting out to make amends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;As shocking and heartbreaking as the Gold King spill and its aftermath may be, it&#39;s merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg. The disaster itself was the climax of the long and troubled story of the Gold King mine, staked by a Swedish immigrant back in 1887. And it was only the most visible manifestation of a slow&amp;#150;moving, multi&amp;#150;faceted environmental catastrophe that had been unfolding here long before the events of August 5, 2015.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Jonathan Thompson&lt;/B&gt; is a native Westerner with deep roots in southwestern Colorado. He has been an environmental journalist focusing on the American West since he signed on as reporter and photographer at the &lt;I&gt;Silverton Standard &amp; the Miner&lt;/I&gt; newspaper in 1996. He has worked and written for &lt;I&gt;High Country News&lt;/I&gt; for over a decade, serving as editor-in-chief from 2007 to 2010. He was a Ted Scripps fellow in environmental journalism at the University of Colorado in Boulder, and in 2016 he was awarded the Society of Environmental Journalists&#39; Outstanding Beat Reporting, Small Market. He currently lives in Bulgaria with his wife Wendy and daughters Lydia and Elena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
