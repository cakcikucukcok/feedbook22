  <title>California Comeback - Narda Zacchino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An in-depth look at California&#39;s remarkable 21st century turnaround, focusing on the role played by the state government under Jerry Brown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the most economically important state in the country--and the 7th largest economy in the world--a political revolution of historic importance has occurred which has not been sufficiently covered by the media. In the state where the Reagan Revolution was born, there has recently occurred a remarkable progressive revolution under the leadership of another governor, four-term Democrat Jerry Brown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past several decades, as it has evolved from a red state to solid blue, California has boldly reinvigorated the notion that government is not a dirty word but rather an instrument for uniting people and improving their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From raising taxes on those with annual incomes over $250,000, to shifting money toward the schools in low-income communities, from seeking environmental alliances with other countries to limit climate change, to the rejection of militaristic solutions to illegal immigration, California has been a laboratory of innovation.&lt;br&gt;Californians have rejected the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; right-wing philosophy that catapulted conservative politics in recent years. That model of endorsing privatization, deregulation, reductions in government spending, and a tax system that disproportionately favors the wealthy, is exemplified by conservative governors and rejected by the pragmatic liberal Jerry Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;California Comeback&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning journalist Narda Zacchino, who has covered California politics for over three decades, clearly lays out the history of California&#39;s initial experiments with progressivism under Brown, its swing to the right under Reagan, near financial collapse under Schwarzenegger, and recent return to stability--bulwarked but the progressive policies made possible by the second coming of Jerry Brown. This progressive mindset, forged in the crucible of the tumultuous last half century, is California&#39;s true contribution not only to the country, but to the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
