  <title>In Leviathan&#39;s Belly: Essays for a Counter-Revolutionary Time - Darko Suvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In eleven incisive, biting essays, Marxist philosopher Darko Suvin suggests that &quot;capitalism (and all of us in Leviathan&#39;s belly) stands today in the presence of Yeats&#39;s rough beast advancing toward Bethlehem, that finance capitalism is not simply a stage but a recurrent &#39;Autumn&#39; signal of transition from one world regime of accumulation and domination to another; it signals the destruction of the old regime and creation of a &#39;new&#39; one.&quot; And to bolster his argument, Suvin points to the economic and social chaos creeping and growing through western society, bank failures, riots, unrest, loss of private capital, loss of middle-class jobs, increase in drug and alcohol abuse, proliferation of guns and other weapons in society, failure of our school systems, inability of police to provide security, and political revolution in less-developed states. The author stresses the need to provide &quot;universal guaranteed income sufficient to modestly live on for all adults working 35 hours a week, and a stress on [providing decent] education and health.&quot; And to fund these simple measures: &quot;Just pay trillions to people instead of banks and the military.&quot; Suvin&#39;s intelligent analysis and commentary will open many eyes that have been prejudiced against socialist thought by the rise of right-wing politicians, and demonstrate quite clearly to the modern reader that there IS another perspective worth considering." />
