  <title>The Escape - Joseph O. E. Ohanugo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book outlined how Joseph who was not born with silver spoon in his mouth went from a  disadvantaged  position  to advantaged position in life. He was not privileged to get normal High School education, but he excelled through hard work to get a university education. Few challenges early in his childhood years did not deter him from moving forward in life.
After his education in  the  U.S, he returned to Nigeria and joined his family business. He never got the kind of cooperation  he  needed  to  move  the business forward.
Like many family businesses in Nigeria which lacked a set goal, the success became difficult.
The  book looked at the  challenges that face teachers in American Schools with particular reference to substitute teachers in the public school system.
The book  dealt  with  marriages in Nigeria with particular reference to Osina Town.
Failing in any endeavor is not important, what is important is the determination to succeed." />
