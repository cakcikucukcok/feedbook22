  <title>Read &amp; Riot - Nadya Tolokonnikova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Stylish, striking, and elegantly packaged...as indispensible to confronting, say, your domineering mother-in-law or your local city council as it is to helping foment an ongoing and ever-escalating insurrection against, say, a sexist, racist, nepotistic power-mad oligarchy threatening to destory democracy as we know it...My advice: Buy one&lt;/em&gt;&quot;--VOGUE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From artist, activist, and Pussy Riot founder Nadya Tolokonnikova, a guerilla guide to radical protest and joyful political resistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The face of modern protest is wearing a brightly colored ski mask. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadya Tolokonnikova, founding member of the Russian activist group Pussy Riot, is a creative activist, professional protestor, brazen feminist, shocking visual artist, and force to be reckoned with. Her spontaneous, explosive approach to political action has involved jumping over barbed wire, kissing police officers, giving guerilla performances in crowded subway cars, and going on a hunger strike to protest the abuse of prisoners. She&amp;#8217;s been horse-whipped by police in Sochi, temporarily blinded when officers threw green paint in her eyes, and monitored by the Russian government. But what made Nadya an activist icon overnight happened on February 21, 2012, when she was arrested for performing an anti-Putin protest song in a Moscow church. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was sent to a Russian prison for 18 months and emerged as an international symbol of radical resistance, as calls to &amp;#8220;Free Pussy Riot&amp;#8221; resounded around the world. With her emblematic ski mask, black lipstick, and unwavering bravery, Nadya has become an emissary of hope and optimism despite overwhelming and ugly political corruption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read &amp;#38; Riot &lt;/em&gt;is structured around Nadya&amp;#8217;s ten rules for revolution (Be a pirate! Make your government shit its pants! Take back the joy!) and illustrated throughout with stunning examples from her extraordinary life and the philosophies of other revolutionary rebels throughout history. Rooted in action and going beyond the typical &amp;#8220;call your senator&amp;#8221; guidelines,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Read &amp;#38; Riot&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;gives us a refreshing model for civil disobedience, and encourages our right to question every status quo and make political action exciting&amp;#8212;even joyful. &lt;/p&gt;" />
