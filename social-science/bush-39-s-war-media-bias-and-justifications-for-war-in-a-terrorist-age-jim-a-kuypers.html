  <title>Bush&#39;s War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age - Jim A. Kuypers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While many books have offered a take on the attacks of 9/11, one area has been comparatively ignored: presidential justifications for war in the age of terrorism. Specifically, what did President Bush say to justify American military actions in the postD9/11 world? And how did the public hear what he said, especially as it was filtered through the news media? The eloquent and thoughtful Bush&#39;s War shows how public perception of what the president says is shaped by media bias. Jim A. Kuypers compares Bush&#39;s statements with press coverage, arguing that the nature of American public knowledge concerning our role in the world has been changed_not by 9/11, but by the subsequent argumentative back-and-forth between Bush and the press." />
