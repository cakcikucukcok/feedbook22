  <title>The Courage of Our Convictions - Gary Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An impassioned call to arms for Democrats to embrace the principles that made the party and the country great--a true moral vision for leadership at home and abroad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this powerful and provocative manifesto, a cri de coeur for Democrats who have grown increasingly frustrated with their party&#39;s leaders, former senator Gary Hart takes the Democrats to task for choosing caution and calculation in place of moral principles. That path, Hart says, will lead only to sorrow--for the party and for the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Courage of Our Convictions&lt;/i&gt; is Hart&#39;s call to action--a clear-eyed and plainspoken manifesto that urges a return to the principles bequeathed to the party by its great twentieth-century presidents: Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s commitment to a single national community, where no American would be left behind; Harry S. Truman&#39;s internationalism, which preserved democracy after World War II and led eventually to the defeat of communism; John F. Kennedy&#39;s ideal of civic duty and service to the nation; and Lyndon B. Johnson&#39;s insistence on equality for all our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the midterm elections approach--and with the 2008 presidential election just over the horizon--Hart speaks directly and passionately to the many Democrats who seek a principled change of leadership in Washington. It is the wake-up call that so many Americans have been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
