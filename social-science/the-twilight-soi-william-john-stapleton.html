  <title>The Twilight Soi - William John Stapleton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Twilight Soi dwells on the dangers of one of the world&amp;#39;s most beautiful and intoxicating cities, Bangkok. It is named after one of Bangkok&amp;#39;s more infamous small streets, or sois as they are known. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soi Twilight runs off the main thoroughfare of Surawong in the centre of Bangkok&amp;#39;s oldest entertainment district Patpong and is known to travelers around the world. It is here where touts from go-go boy bars such as Ocean boys, Bangkok Boys and Classic Boys hustle for the attention of local and international tourists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Twilight Soi began in an angry place - over theft and deception. But applying Western, or in the author&amp;#39;s case Australian, notions of loyalty, honesty, fairness, decency and an abhorrence of deceit do not apply in a country as profoundly different as Thailand. For historical reasons Australians intensely dislike personal treachery or the betrayal of friendship. Standing on these principles in a city like Bangkok marks you as a fool. Ultimately being angry both at your own foolhardiness and the actions of others embitters and harms yourself, no one else. This book ends with more understanding than it began. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of the problems experienced by foreigners in Thailand come from the extreme cultural differences with the West. In Australia a man&amp;#39;s word is his honor. A liar is the lowest form of life. In Thailand only a foreigner would be so rude as to point out that the story told in the morning bears little or no resemblance to the story told in the afternoon." />
