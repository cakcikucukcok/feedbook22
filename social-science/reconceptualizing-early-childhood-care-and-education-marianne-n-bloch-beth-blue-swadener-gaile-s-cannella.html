  <title>Reconceptualizing Early Childhood Care and Education - Marianne N. Bloch, Beth Blue Swadener, Gaile S. Cannella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Reconceptualizing Early Childhood Care and Education&lt;/I&gt; is a foundational text, which presents contemporary theories and debates about early education and child care in many nations. The authors selected are leading contributors in discussions about critical early childhood studies over the past twenty years; the editors are long-time scholars in the reconceptualizing early childhood movement. Audiences include students in graduate courses focused on early childhood and primary education, critical cultural studies of childhood, critical curriculum studies and critical theories that have been contested and debated and drawn from over the course of two decades.&lt;BR&gt; The book is filled with recent scholarship by leading authors in the reconceptualization and rethinking of childhood studies and early childhood fields, who discuss foundational debates, new imaginaries in theory and practice and activist scholarship. A must-read for graduate students and professionals interested in beginning or continuing critical interrogations of current early childhood policy and reforms globally." />
