  <title>First Ladies - Susan Swain, Richard Norton Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;A look inside the personal life of every first lady in American history, based on original interviews with major historians&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;C-SPAN&amp;#39;s yearlong history series, &lt;I&gt;First Ladies: Influence and Image&lt;/I&gt;, featured interviews with more than fifty preeminent historians and biographers. In this informative book, these experts paint intimate portraits of all forty-five first ladies&amp;#151;their lives, ambitions, and unique partnerships with their presidential spouses. Susan Swain and the C-SPAN team elicit the details that made these women who they were: how Martha Washington intentionally set the standards followed by first ladies for the next century; how Edith Wilson was complicit in the cover-up when President Wilson became incapacitated after a stroke; and how Mamie Eisenhower used the new medium of television to reinforce her, and her husband&amp;#39;s, positive public images.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book provides an up-close historical look at these fascinating women who survived the scrutiny of the White House, sometimes at great personal cost, while supporting their families and famous husbands&amp;#151;and sometimes changing history. Complete with illustrations and essential biographical details, it is an illuminating, entertaining, and ultimately inspiring read.&lt;/div&gt;" />
