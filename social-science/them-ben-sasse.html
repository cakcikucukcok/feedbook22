  <title>Them - Ben Sasse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;* AN INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Vanishing American Adult&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;, an intimate and urgent assessment of the existential crisis facing our nation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something is wrong. We all know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American life expectancy is declining for a third straight year. Birth rates are dropping. Nearly half of us think the other political party isn&#39;t just wrong; they&#39;re evil. We&#39;re the richest country in history, but we&#39;ve never been more pessimistic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s causing the despair?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Them&lt;/i&gt;, bestselling author and U.S. senator Ben Sasse argues that, contrary to conventional wisdom, our crisis isn&#39;t really about politics. It&#39;s that we&#39;re so lonely we can&#39;t see straight--and it bubbles out as anger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local communities are collapsing. Across the nation, little leagues are disappearing, Rotary clubs are dwindling, and in all likelihood, we don&#39;t know the neighbor two doors down. Work isn&#39;t what we&#39;d hoped: less certainty, few lifelong coworkers, shallow purpose. Stable families and enduring friendships--life&#39;s fundamental pillars--are in statistical freefall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As traditional tribes of place evaporate, we rally against common enemies so we can feel part of a team. No institutions command widespread public trust, enabling foreign intelligence agencies to use technology to pick the scabs on our toxic divisions. We&#39;re in danger of half of us believing different facts than the other half, and the digital revolution throws gas on the fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a path forward--but reversing our decline requires something radical: a rediscovery of real places and human-to-human relationships. Even as technology nudges us to become &lt;i&gt;rootless&lt;/i&gt;, Sasse shows how only a recovery of &lt;i&gt;rootedness&lt;/i&gt; can heal our lonely souls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America wants you to be happy, but more urgently, America needs you to love your neighbor and connect with your community. Fixing what&#39;s wrong with the country depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
