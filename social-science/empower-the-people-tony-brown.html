  <title>Empower the People - Tony Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the follow-up to his very successful &lt;em&gt;Black Lies, White Lies,&lt;/em&gt; controversial talk-show host and radio commentator Tony Brown presents a practical plan to reclaim our resources and institutions from a selfish and exclusive power elite.&lt;p&gt;At the start of the twentieth century, argues Tony Brown, the world&#39;s economy was hijacked. In capitalist and communist countries alike, elitist groups took control of international trade and national banks, with dire results for the ordinary citizen. Ever since, capital has moved toward a single inner circle -- the Ruling Class Conspiracy -- who monopolize the world&#39;s markets and even its governments for personal profit. Their stratagems range from the &quot;war&quot; against drugs to deliberately induced racial conflict among ethnic groups in America -- none in earnest, all carefully designed to preserve a pernicious status quo.&lt;p&gt;But Tony Brown has a remedy. His provocative and empowering seven-step plan offers an opportunity to break free once and for all from the constricting control of the wealthy and powerful who have run the world for far too long -- including a point-by-point program for radical reform of the income tax and a proposal to muzzle the Federal Reserve Bank, which exerts unconscionable influence over the lives of every American.&lt;p&gt;Incendiary and persuasive, this book reaches beyond race to claim the high ground of historical, logical, and moral analysis. For nearly half a century of Cold War, America and the Free World were defined by opposition to Communism...but was this merely a red herring to ensure the domination of the haves over the have-nots? Read &lt;em&gt;Empower the People,&lt;/em&gt; form your own conclusions...and hit the brakes! &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
