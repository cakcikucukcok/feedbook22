  <title>The Jagged Word Field Guide To Being A Man - Scott Keith, Paul Koch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This collection of essays explores masculinity in an unsystematic way. We&amp;rsquo;ve found that the various ways we&amp;rsquo;ve approached masculinity tend to fall into some broad and practical categories in our writing. To be a man means to be free to be what God has already declared we are in Christ&amp;mdash;&amp;shy;His saved and redeemed men. A man is free; we are free from sin, death, and the power of the devil. Being free, a man is then honored to work for his neighbor&amp;rsquo;s good, knowing that his closest neighbors are those whom God has placed closest to him in his life&amp;mdash;&amp;shy;his family. And just as a man speaks to and cares for his own, so also does a man need to be spoken to and cared for at times. He needs the mutual consolation of the brethren, a brotherhood. To put it simply, a man needs good friends. Over and over again, we find praise for fun, the love of good fellowship, good drink, and good smoke.&lt;/p&gt;" />
