  <title>The Empire and the Five Kings - Bernard-Henri Lévy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the West&#39;s leading intellectuals offers a provocative look at America&#39;s withdrawal from world leadership and the rising powers who seek to fill the vacuum left behind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The United States was once the hope of the world, a beacon of freedom and the defender of liberal democracy. Nations and peoples on all continents looked to America to stand up for the values that created the Western worldand to oppose autocracy and repression. Even when America did not live up to its ideals, it still recognized their importance, at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Bernard-Henri Lévy lays bare in this powerful and disturbing analysis of the world today, America is retreating from its traditional leadership role, and in its place have come five ambitious powers, former empires eager to assert their primacy and influence. Lévy shows how these five--Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, and Sunni radical Islamism--are taking steps to undermine the liberal values that have been a hallmark of Western civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Empire and the Five Kings &lt;/i&gt;is a &lt;i&gt;cri de coeur&lt;/i&gt; that draws upon lessons from history and the eternal touchstones of human culture to reveal the stakes facing the West as America retreats from its leadership role, a process that did not begin with Donald Trump&#39;s presidency and is not likely to end with him. The crisis is one whose roots can be found as far back as antiquity and whose resolution will require the West to find a new way forward if its principles and values are to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As seen on &lt;i&gt;Real Time with Bill Maher&lt;/i&gt; (2/22/2019) and &lt;i&gt;Fareed Zakaria GPS&lt;/i&gt; (2/17/2019).&lt;/p&gt;" />
