  <title>Steel and Ice - Linda Giles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;I was born in 2009 after my creator grabbed her creative balls and decided to let me out of her
imagination. Damn, its good to be out and alive! As I said, I was born in 2009 and was let out in
2010. My creator was inspired by a great friend of hers. R.I.P Shawn! He had a passion for riding
his motorcycle and was an unbelievable man.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
My creator has taken an artistic journey and expanded me into a Book complied of crazy
digital abstract paintings. She has put me on Hoodies, T-Shirts (long and short sleeved), and is
now doing customized prints of other riders Pride and Joy, their bikes! Soon I hope to be on the
back of riders all over the world. People have seemed to taken an interest in me before I even knew
wherwe I was going, what a rush it is! The more bikes I get to take on, in an artistic way of course,
the more alive I feel. What an empowering journey this is to be a part of something so creative and
so different and most importantly being a part of something that captures the very essence of ones
glory. To feel the wind at your back, the sun beating down on you, and the energetic force that is
the motorcycle! My heart races when I can hear a growl, flying down an open road and it almost
seems to whisper catch me if you can. For all those who share the same thrill and love of the ride,
youve got to check me out, Steel and Ice Motorcycle Art!!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Cheers all, and remember to always take your friends with you on your journeys!&lt;/center&gt;" />
