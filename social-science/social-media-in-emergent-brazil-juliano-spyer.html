  <title>Social Media in Emergent Brazil - Juliano Spyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since the birth of the internet, low-income
  Brazilians have received little government support to help them access it. In
  response, they have largely self-financed their digital migration. Internet
  cafés became prosperous businesses in working-class neighbourhoods and rural
  settlements, and, more recently, families have aspired to buy their own home computer
  with hire purchase agreements. As low-income Brazilians began to access
  popular social media sites in the mid-2000s, affluent Brazilians ridiculed
  their limited technological skills, different tastes and poor schooling, but
  this did not deter them from expanding their online presence. Young people
  created profiles for barely literate older relatives and taught them to
  navigate platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Based on 15 months of
ethnographic research, this book aims to understand why low-income Brazilians
have invested so much of their time and money in learning about social media. Juliano
Spyer explores this question from a number of perspectives, including education,
relationships, work and politics. He argues that social media is the way for
low-income Brazilians to stay connected to the family and friends they see in
person on a regular basis, which suggests that social media serves a crucial
function in strengthening traditional social relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
