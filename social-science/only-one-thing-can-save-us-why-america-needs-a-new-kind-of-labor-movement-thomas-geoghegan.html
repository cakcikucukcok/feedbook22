  <title>Only One Thing Can Save Us: Why America Needs a New Kind of Labor Movement - Thomas Geoghegan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Is labor&amp;#8217;s day over or is labor the only real answer for our time? In this new book, National Book Critics Circle Award finalist and labor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan argues that even as organized labor seems to be crumbling, a revived&amp;#8212;but different&amp;#8212;labor movement is now more relevant than ever in our increasingly unequal society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inequality reshaping the country goes beyond money and income: the workplace is more authoritarian than ever, and we have even less of a say over our conditions at work. He tells us stories, sometimes humorous but more often chilling, about problems working people like his own clients&amp;#8212;cabdrivers, cashiers, even Chicago public school teachers&amp;#8212;now face in our largely union-free economy. He then explains why a new kind of labor movement (and not just more higher education) will be crucial for saving what is left of the middle class; pushing Keynes&amp;#8217;s original, sometimes forgotten ideas for getting the rich to invest and reduce our balance of trade; and promoting John Dewey&amp;#8217;s &quot;democratic way of life&quot;&amp;#8212;one that would start in the schools and continue in our places of work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &quot;public policy&quot; book that is compulsively readable, &lt;i&gt;Only One Thing Can Save Us&lt;/i&gt; is vintage Geoghegan, blending acerbic and witty commentary with unparalleled insight into the real dynamics (and human experience) of working in America today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
