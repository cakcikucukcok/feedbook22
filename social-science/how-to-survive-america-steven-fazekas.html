  <title>How to Survive America? - Steven Fazekas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While this book is intended for people who wish to immigrate to America, others like: visitors, businessmen and tourists can also benefit from its guidance. Indeed it is a guidebook, a self-help how to do that is essential for everyone wanting to know the real America.
          The author is a seasoned immigrant who had lived in many countries (as an immigrant) prior to coming to America. That experience enabled him to contrast the good, the bad, the ugly and the in-between with the dreams, expectations and illusions of new immigrants coming to this country. Based on personal experiences from the beginning to the end, this book is a must read for all immigrants and visitors coming to America." />
