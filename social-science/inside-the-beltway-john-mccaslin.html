  <title>Inside the Beltway - John McCaslin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Award-winning columnist sheds light on people, places, and disorderly procedures in nation&#39;s capital.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;John McCaslin&#39;s &quot;Inside the Beltway&quot; column has been a favorite of &lt;I&gt;Washington Times&lt;/I&gt; readers for years. Now, in his first book ever, McCaslin applies his special brand of humor and warmth, recounting his remarkable journalistic journey from Whitefish, Montana (where he reported on grizzly attacks), to the White House (where he covers an even more ferocious beast . . . politicians) and sharing the funniest, saddest, and most offbeat stories along the way.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Whether he&#39;s knee-deep in the bowels of Capitol Hill, or paying his final respects at an unkempt cemetery in Brazil (yes . . . Brazil), McCaslin digs deep for his one-of-a-kind collection of Washington tales. You can laugh, cry, and shout all in the same chapter. A fun and brisk read?and you&#39;ll know why I avoid Washington afterwards!&quot; ?Rush Limbaugh&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;I read two things every day: the Bible and John McCaslin&#39;s column in &lt;I&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/I&gt;. That way I know what both sides are up to.&quot; ?Paul Begala, former counselor to President Bill Clinton and a cohost of CNN&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Crossfire&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;John McCaslin is a great storyteller. I love the way he writes?and he writes about all of the things I&#39;m interested in. Whether you are a Democrat of a Republican, you will love this book.&quot; ?Sam Donaldson ABC News&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;John McCaslin is one of those few people in Washington who deliver every day. His &#39;Inside the Beltway&#39; anecdotes are an antidote to the foibles of the famous in our nation&#39;s capital. This book is a must for those who know how to smile!&quot; ?Oliver North host of &lt;I&gt;War Stories&lt;/I&gt; on the FOX News Channel&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;" />
