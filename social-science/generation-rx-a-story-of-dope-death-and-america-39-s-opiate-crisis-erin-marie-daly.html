  <title>Generation Rx: A Story of Dope, Death, and America&#39;s Opiate Crisis - Erin Marie Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;These are the harrowing questions that plagued Erin Marie Daly after her youngest brother Pat, an OxyContin addict, was found dead of a heroin overdose at the age of twenty. In just a few short years, the powerful prescription painkiller had transformed him from a fun-loving ball of energy to a heroin addict so hell-bent on getting his next fix that he was willing to lie, steal, and hurt everyone he loved. Yet even as Pat&amp;#8217;s addiction destroyed his external life, his internal struggle with opiates was far more heart wrenching. Erin set out on a painful personal journey to learn what had really happened to her little brother; as a journalist, she was startled to discover a new twist to the ongoing prescription drug epidemic. That kids are hooked on prescription drugs is nothing new; what is new is the rising number of young heroin junkies whose addiction began with pills in suburban bedrooms, and how a generation of young people playing around with today&amp;#8217;s increasingly powerful opioids are finding themselves in the frightening grip of heroin.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While many books have tackled the topic of Big Pharma, drug addiction, and our increasingly over-medicated society, &lt;I&gt;Generation Rx&lt;/I&gt; offers an entirely new look at what the prescription pill epidemic means for today&amp;#8217;s youth, and the world around them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
