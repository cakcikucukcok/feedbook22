  <title>Civil War Talks - George S. Bernard, John Horn, Hampton Newsome, John G. Selby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George S. Bernard was a Petersburg lawyer and member of the 12th Virginia
    Infantry Regiment during the Civil War. Over the course of his life, Bernard wrote extensively
    about his wartime experiences and collected accounts from other veterans. In 1892, he published
    &lt;i&gt;War Talks of Confederate Veterans,&lt;/i&gt; a collection of firsthand accounts
    focusing on the battles and campaigns of the 12th Virginia that is widely read to this day.
    Bernard prepared a second volume but was never able to publish it. After his death in 1912, his
    papers became scattered or simply lost. But a series of finds, culminating with the discovery of
    a cache of papers in Roanoke in 2004, have made it possible to reconstruct a complete manuscript
    of the unpublished second volume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The resulting book, &lt;i&gt;Civil War
    Talks,&lt;/i&gt; contains speeches, letters, Bernard’s wartime diary, and other firsthand
    accounts of the war not only by veterans of the Confederacy, such as General William Mahone, but
    by Union veterans as well. Their personal stories cover the major military campaigns in
    Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania--Seven Pines, Malvern Hill, Gettysburg, Wilderness,
    Spotsylvania, Petersburg, and Appomattox. For the general reader, this volume offers evocative
    testimonies focusing on the experiences of individual soldiers. For scholars, it provides
    convenient access to many accounts that, until now, have not been widely available or have been
    simply unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
