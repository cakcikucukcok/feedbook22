  <title>The Kennedy Legacy - Vincent Bzdek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John, Robert, and Ted Kennedy&#39;s individual stories can be seen as essentially one, each successive brother striving to fulfill the interrupted promise of the brother before. The closing of Ted Kennedy&#39;s chapter in America&#39;s political and cultural life means that, for the first time perhaps, the real measure of the Kennedy legacy can finally be taken. This is a story of a brotherhood in three acts: Act I is John F. Kennedy&#39;s presidency, as seen from Ted&#39;s front-row seat. Act II is Robert Kennedy&#39;s five brief years as the family standard bearer, including his tenure in the Senate with his brother Ted and the memorable 82-day presidential campaign that redefined the Kennedy legacy. Act III is Ted&#39;s 40-plus years in the Senate as keeper of the flame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did the brothers pass the torch to each other? What have the three brothers left us collectively? And who carries the torch forward now? &lt;i&gt;The Kennedy Legacy &lt;/i&gt;compellingly answers these questions and much more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
