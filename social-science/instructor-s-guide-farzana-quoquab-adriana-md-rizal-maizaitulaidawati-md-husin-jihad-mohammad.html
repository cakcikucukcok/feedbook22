  <title>Instructor’S Guide - Farzana Quoquab, Adriana Md Rizal, Maizaitulaidawati Md Husin, Jihad Mohammad...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is ideal for teaching subjects related to marketing, management, entrepreneurship, and business ethics. It can be used as the tool to teach students/trainers in advanced undergraduate and MBA/MSc classes. It is widely acknowledged that, only theoretical discussion does not provide the comprehensive understanding about the business decisions that are taken by the managers and/or other parties involved. And thus, use of cases are common in business studies which not only provides students understanding about the practical aspects of the concepts that are being taught in text-books, but also it introduces students with several aspects of the real-life dilemma, complexities and challenges while working in a business environment.
This book contains teaching notes of the book titled A Handbook of Malaysian Cases: Contemporary Issues in Marketing &amp; Management in which eleven local cases were presented. The teaching notes serve as a guide for instructors who intend to utilize these cases in their classes. Each teaching note includes a brief synopsis of the case, learning objectives, the case&#39;s target audience, information about the case leading strategies, relevant concepts/subjects, suggested assignment questions, and their corresponding suggested answers. In this way, the instructors will have greater understanding about the use and applicability of the said eleven cases. It is hoped that university lecturers, practitioners, and students who are undertaking courses in business studies will benefit from this book." />
