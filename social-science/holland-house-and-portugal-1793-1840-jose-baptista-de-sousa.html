  <title>Holland House and Portugal, 1793–1840 - Jose Baptista de Sousa</title>

The book traces the evolution of Holland’s views on Portugal from the time of his first visit to Spain to his later contribution to the establishment of a constitutional regime in Portugal. [NP] Lord Holland’s influence on the establishment of a constitutional regime in Spain in 1809–10 and – indirectly and unintentionally – in Portugal in 1820–23 is examined at some length, as is his contribution to the establishment of a Liberal regime in Portugal in 1834. ‘Holland House and Portugal’ includes a study of the extent of Holland’s support for the Portuguese Liberal cause after Dom Miguel’s usurpation of the throne in 1828 and of his subsequent role in the ‘Liberal invasion’ of Portugal.
