  <title>King Of Debt – Businessman Donald J. Trump - Thomas Pentzek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who is Donald J. Trump?&lt;br/&gt;
That’s what the whole world has been wanting to know since November 2016!&lt;br/&gt;
Those who live outside the US only knew him from his appearances on the reality show The Apprentice, in which he presented himself as a successful businessman.&lt;br/&gt;
One thing stands out, however: where other millionaires or billionaires shy away from the public, Trump takes every opportunity to put himself out there, to the extent that it is difficult to separate reality from the perfect performance.&lt;br/&gt;
When researching for my book The King of Debts, I had the opportunity to study the successes and failures of Donald Trump.&lt;br/&gt;
Every additional affair, every professional failure and every attack on the media I discovered shocked me more.&lt;br/&gt;
Slowly a picture emerged of the billionaire who in 2017 became the president of one of the most important countries in the world.&lt;br/&gt;
Why does he react the way he does?&lt;br/&gt;
Why does he act the way he does?&lt;br/&gt;
What is the basis for his success in the US?&lt;br/&gt;" />
