  <title>Because of Sex - Gillian Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Meticulously researched and rewarding to read...Thomas is a gifted storyteller.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best known as a monumental achievement of the civil rights movement, the 1964 Civil Rights Act also revolutionized the lives of America&#39;s working women. Title VII of the law made it illegal to discriminate &quot;because of sex.&quot;  But that simple phrase didn&#39;t mean much until ordinary women began using the law to get justice on the job--and some took their fights all the way to the Supreme Court. Among them were Ida Phillips, denied an assembly line job because she had a preschool-age child; Kim Rawlinson, who fought to become a prison guard--a &quot;man&#39;s job&quot;; Mechelle Vinson, who brought a lawsuit for sexual abuse before &quot;sexual harassment&quot; even had a name; Ann Hopkins, denied partnership at a Big Eight accounting firm because the men in charge thought she needed &quot;a course at charm school&quot;; and most recently, Peggy Young, UPS truck driver, forced to take an unpaid leave while pregnant because she asked for a temporary reprieve from heavy lifting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These unsung heroines&#39; victories, and those of the other women profiled in Gillian Thomas&#39; &lt;i&gt;Because of Sex&lt;/i&gt;, dismantled a &quot;Mad Men&quot; world where women could only hope to play supporting roles; where sexual harassment was &quot;just the way things are&quot;; and where pregnancy meant getting a pink slip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through first-person accounts and vivid narrative, &lt;i&gt;Because of Sex &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of how one law, our highest court, and a few tenacious women changed the American workplace forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
