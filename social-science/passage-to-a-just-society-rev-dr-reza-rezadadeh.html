&lt;P&gt;This study demonstrates that because their opposing nature, democracy and capitalism or socialism cannot coexist. To have a democratic society, we have to replace capitalism or socialism with a democratic free market economy and take government out of regulating peoples business and daily life.. The author attempts to present such a democratic concept, its societal structure and function and how under such a  system people understand the purpose of life, work less hours, yet have a prosperous, leisurely and satisfying life. The book is actually the story of some parts from the authors life, written in an autobiographical form, showing hardships, sufferings, failures,  incredible adventures, romance and love he encountered in developing his theory, and how persistence and determination , despite repeated failures, helped him to succeed in developing his theory and at the same time, transformed him to a better human being.&lt;/P&gt;" />
