  <title>Dial &quot;L&quot; for Lesbian and &quot;P&quot; for Pain Volume 1 Thru 3 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Volume 1:  I felt myself become even more excited. The very idea of this sexy, intelligent, hot woman wanting to do things to me, even though I had no idea of what those things could possibly be. I heard myself blurt out hopefully, &quot;Do you want to do sexual things to me?&quot;     &quot;Have you ever been spanked, tied up or dominated by another woman before?&quot; Victoria asked.  Volume 2:  I went home and took a long hot bath and prepared myself for her. I wanted my body to be perfect when I undressed this evening. It was as if I was preparing myself for a sacrifice to a goddess. And in a way, I was.  With her usual confidence, she walked towards me and started to strip my clothes off. I had surprised my goddess and underneath my coat, I was only wearing pink lace panties and a pink lace bra with matching garters and stockings. The panties and bra had little pink bows on them.  Volume 3:    I was wearing a mini skirt with a tight blouse, a white lace bra and matching white lace panties." />
