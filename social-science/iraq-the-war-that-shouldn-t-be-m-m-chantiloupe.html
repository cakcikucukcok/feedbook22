  <title>Iraq: the War That Shouldn’T Be - M. M. Chantiloupe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;My entrepreneurial father was involved in politics and government. And, these attributes became a part of my life. I always want to know what is happening in the government as well as the private sector, not only in the U.S. but other countries as well. My interest piques more so during an election year and a new administration. 
After watching the buildings collapsed downtown Manhattan on September 11, 2001, and the ensuing catastrophe, I started to do some research on Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. I discovered that bin Laden and Saddam Hussein disliked each other so it was unlikely that they would work together.
In 1998 the Clinton administration launched Desert Fox and took out Iraqs chemical facilities and containment was effective because of the no-fly zone. And in August 1982, Israel used U.S. Tama Hawk missiles to take out Iraqs nuclear facilities and it was never restarted. Being a concerned citizen, it was incumbent upon me to make the information available to the general public. I received a letter from a congressional member saying the information compiled in my book should be brought to the attention of the general public and the nations lawmakers and invited me to take part in a panel discussion in Congress on January 29, 2007.&quot;" />
