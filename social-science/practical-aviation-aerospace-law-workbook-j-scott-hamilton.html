  <title>Practical Aviation &amp; Aerospace Law Workbook - J. Scott Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This supporting workbook is designed to be used with the &lt;I&gt;Practical Aviation &amp; Aerospace Law&lt;/I&gt; textbook to provide a comprehensive instructional package for undergraduate and graduate aviation law courses offered to students preparing for aviation careers. It aids in application of legal principles set forth in the textbook to the kinds of decisions students will make in the real world of aviation as managers, pilots, mechanics, aircraft owners, air traffic controllers, air safety investigators, and others involved in aviation as a profession or hobby. The updated and expanded Sixth Edition reflects statutory and regulatory changes, international treaty law, and includes law topics surrounding the burgeoning fields of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and commercial spaceflight.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With a concise format that mimics the textbook, this combination workbook/study guide breaks down a complex field of law into understandable examples and problems to solve &amp;#151; ultimately helping readers retain the learned concepts. Many of the workbook questions are based on real dilemmas faced by the author&amp;#8217;s clients during his more than 30 years experience. Others are the product of a fertile imagination&amp;#133;yet they give aviation law students an idea of what can happen in real industry situations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This &lt;I&gt;Practical Aviation &amp; Aerospace Law Workbook&lt;/I&gt; enhances the value of the textbook, serving as an excellent supporting teaching tool &amp;#151; taken together, the two complement each other perfectly in the classroom.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
