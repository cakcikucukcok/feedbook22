  <title>God: Rational Theology - Guro Bert Domingo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rational Theology
In Search of World Peace
Humanity is One
	The greatest single source of human conflict has to do with beliefs or of faith that one holds.  The variety of human ideas, most often irreconcilable with one another, has lead to divisions and endless schisms.  There is a great need to accommodate and harmonize ideas by convergence at the point where agreement   is possible.  Rationalization, convergence, and unification at the center is necessary to achieve world peace.  However, this is only possible when rational people can discuss openly without fear of each other.  The steps to accomplish this enormous task can only start with the individual.  This is the goal of this work.
	A person needs to have sufficient knowledge to understand the various facets of life.  This would include a philosophical base of values with a worldview encompassing and transcending all biases and prejudices inherent in, and inculcated by the culture.  No religious, scientific, or traditional views must be sacrosanct to analysis.  With adequate knowledge, one gains freedom from ignorance and fear. 
 	This book, Rational Theology, is a guidebook for any individual desiring to discover real freedom.  It is a companion of the authors book Freedom Trilogy.  Freedom Trilogy is a self-help and how-to-book.  It helps develop thinking and reasoning abilities.  It challenges the mind to gain new perspectives.  It contains the ISA Introspective Self-analysis method of discovering ourselves and gaining freedom from fear and anxieties.
Through Knowledge, Ignorance and Fear are banished, Freedom Attained once we discover and understand ourselves." />
