  <title>Facing the Truth - Dr. Tom McMurtry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You are now or soon shall be what your friends are!
This was a powerful statement that I heard a preacher say many years ago. It made me stop and look at the people that I considered as friends. Are they the kind of person that I want to be? Are they the kind of person that my Heavenly Father would want me to associate with? Another good question that I asked myself was, Am I a good friend? 
In those days a person had to have actual personal contact with someone for them to be considered a friend. With todays technology and social media web sites, friendships are growing rapidly. They are having daily contact with many more people.
A person should always be careful of whom their friends are, but even more in todays fast paced world.    
James 4:4  Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
God tells us clearly to examine our friendships! This book will help you to take a close look at this new world of quick communication. It will show you Biblically how God will judge your friends list." />
