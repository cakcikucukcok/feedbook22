  <title>Caught in the Middle East - Peter L. Hahn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="American postwar efforts to ameliorate Arab-Israeli relations entangled the United States in the Arab-Israeli conflict in complex ways. Peter L. Hahn explores the diplomatic and cultural factors that influenced the policies of Presidents Truman and Eisenhower as they faced the escalation of one of the modern world&#39;s most intractable disputes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Truman tended to make decisions in an ad hoc, reactive fashion. Eisenhower, in contrast, had a more proactive approach to the regional conflict, but strategic and domestic political factors prevented him from dramatically revising the basic tenets Truman had established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American officials desired--in principle--to promote Arab-Israeli peace in order to stabilize the region.

They were unable to relinquish the responsibilities they had accepted with their new power--even as those responsibilities became increasingly difficult to fulfill.
