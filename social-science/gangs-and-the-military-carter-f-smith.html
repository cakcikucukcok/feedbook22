  <title>Gangs and the Military - Carter F. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the past several decades, there has been a continuous and growing focus on street gangs, outlaw motorcycle gangs, and domestic extremist groups. Many of these groups have members with military training, and some actively recruit from current and former military veterans and retirees. That military experience adds to the dangerousness of veteran gang members, as well as those groups they associate with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Communities everywhere are experiencing the damaging impact of gang criminal behavior. By observing gang activity from the Revolutionary War to today Smith examines the presence of military-trained, often veteran, gang members in the communities. He looks at the turning points in gang investigations in the military, and also looks at the laws and policies designed to specifically counter the criminal activity the threats of gang activity pose on a community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grounded in current knowledge and research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;, Gangs and the Military&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; successfully addresses the growing presence of criminal gang members in the United States. As well as reflects on how the authorities that counter and combat them are doing so on a national and global level. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
