  <title>The Ebola Virus and West Africa - Dr. Felix I. Ikuomola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Ebola Virus and West Africa: Medical and Sociocultural Aspects&lt;/I&gt; provides a compact summary of the Ebola virus, outlining its nature, history, epidemiology, and methods of treatment. In addition, the work examines the context of the diseases outbreak by describing the people, politics, and policies in West Africa before, during, and after the recent outbreak. Finally, chapters summarize and explore the ethical issues that arise in pursuing treatments and discuss methods for improving control and prevention of additional outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Felix I. Ikuomola, a medical doctor who is pursuing additional advanced degrees in clinical research (UH) and surgical sciences (RCSEd/Edin), brings to bear his practice of medicine and surgery in Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia and his direct knowledge of the cultural practices and factors at play in the countries of West Africa to ground the presentation in &lt;i&gt;The Ebola Virus and West Africa&lt;/i&gt; in the realities of the current situation in the region.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Ebola Virus and West Africa: Medical and Sociocultural Aspects&lt;/I&gt; will provide a highly organized, comprehensive, and insightful treatment of this virulent disease and its sociocultural elements to people with medical backgrounds and to individuals desiring to understand more comprehensively the impact of this disease on West Africa. In either case, time spent with &lt;I&gt;The Ebola Virus and West Africa&lt;/I&gt; will give you the background and analysis you need to respond intelligently to the challenges the virus presents to an increasingly globalized culture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
