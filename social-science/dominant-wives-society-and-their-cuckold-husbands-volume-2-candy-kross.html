  <title>Dominant Wives Society and Their Cuckold Husbands Volume 2 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Well, you asked us to humiliate our husbands, preferably in a public place. Which is exactly what I did.&quot; Nancy began her story.    Nancy has a friend who is a hypnotist and performs several times a week at one of the local nightclubs. She came up with a plan to humiliate her husband... in public.    She called her friend, the hypnotist, Paul was his name, and told him of her plan and that she and her husband would be attending his next show. Paul agreed to the plan she had told him.    Paul had an outstanding reputation for hypnotizing people. He was only allowed to work at places that were for 21 and over. Part of his act was to hypnotize people into doing things sexually that they wouldn&#39;t normally do. And to do it on stage in front of a lot of people!  Nancy and Bob had taken their seats in the audience. Their table was in the front row, so they could get a good view. Also, so Nancy could volunteer her husband, Bob, to get up on stage to be hypnotized." />
