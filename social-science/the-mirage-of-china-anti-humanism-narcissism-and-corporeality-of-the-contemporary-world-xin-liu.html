  <title>The Mirage of China: Anti-Humanism, Narcissism, and Corporeality of the Contemporary World - Xin Liu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 	Today&#39;s world is one marked by the signs of digital capitalism and global capitalist expansion, and China is increasingly being integrated into this global system of production and consumption. As a result, China&#39;s immediate material impact is now felt almost everywhere in the world; however, the significance and process of this integration is far from understood. This study shows how the a &lt;i&gt;priori&lt;/i&gt; categories of statistical reasoning came to be re-born and re-lived in the People&#39;s Republic - as essential conditions for the possibility of a new mode of knowledge and governance. From the ruins of the Maoist revolution China has risen through a mode of quantitative self-objectification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 	As the author argues, an epistemological rift has separated the Maoist years from the present age of the People&#39;s Republic, which appears on the global stage as a mirage. This study is an ethnographic investigation of concepts - of the conceptual forces that have produced and been produced by - two forms of knowledge, life, and governance. As the author shows, the world of China, contrary to the common view, is not the Chinese world; it is a symptomatic moment of our world at the present time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
