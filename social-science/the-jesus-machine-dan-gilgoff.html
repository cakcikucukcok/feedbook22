  <title>The Jesus Machine - Dan Gilgoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;*The crucial Ohio get-out-the-vote effort that lifted Bush over Kerry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The Terri Schiavo controversy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The push for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Attacks on Roe v. Wade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&quot;Intelligent design&quot; in our science curriculum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evangelical right has pushed all of these initiatives, led by the immense behind-the-scenes influence of Dr. James Dobson, the founder and chairman of Focus on the Family: an organization that has grown from its roots as a local parenting advice center to a powerful ministry that broadcasts Dr. Dobson each day on more than 3,000 radio and 80 television stations in the U.S. alone. Dobson has supplanted Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, and Ralph Reed as the spokesman for tens of millions of American evangelical Christians--even though Dobson is not a minister, but a family therapist with a doctorate in child development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobson maintains that the American political and social spectrums are firmly rooted in a centuries-old Christian tradition--one that has come under siege beginning in the 1960s, spear-headed by court rulings that have undermined the necessity of religion in public life. With the support of evangelical followers, Dobson has garnered more and support than many ever thought possible and has harnessed this power to wage a crusade in support of strengthening abortion restrictions and establishing anti-gay rights litigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Jesus Machine&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to examine Focus on the Family as the cutting edge of the larger evangelical movement, backing what many view to be goals in common with the current political agenda of the Bush administration, as it works to become the voice of mainstream America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through exhaustive research, Dan Gilgoff, a Senior Reporter for US News &amp; World Report, exposes the intricacies of the Focus on the Family&#39;s rallying cry and the drastic implications they hold for the future of America&#39;s political system.&lt;/p&gt;" />
