  <title>Preventing the Future - Tom Garvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Between the years of the mid-thirties through to 1960, independent Ireland suffered from economic stagnation, and also went through a period of intense cultural and psychological repression. While external circumstances account for much of the stagnation &amp;ndash; especially the depression of the thirties and the Second World War &amp;ndash; &lt;i&gt;Preventing the Future&lt;/i&gt; argues that the situation was aggravated by internal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key domestic factor was the failure to extend higher and technical education and training to larger sections of the population. This derived from political stalemates in a small country which derived in turn from the power of the Catholic Church, the strength of the small-farm community, the ideological wish to preserve an older society and, later, gerontocratic tendencies in the political elites and in society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While economic growth did accelerate after 1960, the political stand-off over mass education resulted in large numbers of young people being denied preparation for life in the modern world and, arguably, denied Ireland a sufficient supply of trained labour and educated citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland&#39;s Celtic Tiger of the nineties was in great part driven by a new and highly educated and technically trained workforce. The political stalemates of the forties and fifties delayed the initial, incomplete take-off until the sixties and resulted in the Tiger arriving nearly a generation later than it might have.&lt;/p&gt;" />
