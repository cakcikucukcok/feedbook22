  <title>Slavery Continues - Mehr A. Kalami</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since thousands of years, slavery in every form has been the root cause of misery and crime in every society it has crept in.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Shackles and fetters are not the only means of enslavement of humankind-by-humankind. Enslavers employ many other means to dehumanize humanity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Slavery is in various forms; human trafficking, organized abduction, prostitution, deprivation of rights to freedom of worship, thoughts, press and speech.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Torture and imprisonment of the general population on trumped up charges in medieval dungeons by sadistic dictators is not a new phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This millennia old ailment refuses to ablate by a few jolts. Countless Symposiums and Resolutions passed by Societies and Organizations throughout the world have had no effect on this chronic scourge.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many governments have in private considered slavery as a boon to their economy! While outwardly condemning, but inwardly condoning it, notorious regimes are even signatories to the passive Resolutions passed by the United Nations. Many while allowing this vile trade to continue in their country adopt a struthious approach to this saga!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Only a genuine crusade supported by every government in the world to wage a relentless war of attrition against this evil can be effective.&lt;/p&gt;" />
