      <meta name="description" content="Holly Bea&#39;s beloved bullmastiff, Buddy, is having a bad day. Left alone to guard the house, he is taunted by the neighborhood cats, who know that he can&#39;t touch them. Buddy is worried-will Holly be back soon, or is she gone for the day, or even forever? Much to Buddy&#39;s relief, Holly returns. They go to the park, but Buddy&#39;s fun is cut short by a pack of hostile squirrels and a team of Dalmatian firedogs who challenge his self-esteem. Will this day ever end? Buddy&#39;s day is a metaphor for the doubts and anxieties children face, and a soothing reminder that God will always be there for them." />
