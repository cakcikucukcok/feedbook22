  <title>The Adventures of Alfred in the Greatest Fruit of All - Gail R. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alfred&#39;s parents have a parent-teacher conference with his third-grade homeroom teacher. His teacher shares that Alfred has a social problem. He doesn&#39;t get along with others. He doesn&#39;t follow directions, and he is always daydreaming in class and not paying attention but can be caught talking about his football practice during class. Afterward, Alfred&#39;s parents had a talk with him about his behavior in school and his grades.
The other teachers complain that Alfred hits people and calls them names. He seems to be a good child, but won&#39;t volunteer to help, and there are issues that need to be addressed and behavior redirected.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Alfred&#39;s teacher wants to put him on an intervention behavior plan. His teacher and parents agree that taking him off the football team until his behavior and grades improves would help. It will also show that there are consequences for bad behavior.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They also believe it will help him bring out other issues that may be bothering him, so he can learn to deal with them in a positive manner.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Alfred meets several kids who help him improve his behavior. They teach him using nine fruits of the spirit from Galatians 5:2223: love, joy, peace, kindness, patience, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control, the greatest fruit of all.&lt;br&gt;" />
