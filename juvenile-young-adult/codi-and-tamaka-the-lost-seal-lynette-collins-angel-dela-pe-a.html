  <title>Codi and Tamaka: the Lost Seal - Lynette Collins, Angel dela Pe単a</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Codi is ten years old when she runs away to hide on her fathers fishing boat, Angel-Blue. Her family has been having money problems. Her dad is a fisherman, but hes had bad luck this year. He cant seem to find any fish, which makes him argue with Codis mother. They might even have to vacate their happy island home and move into the city.
Fearful at the thought of leaving, Codi heads to Angel-Blue and hides. The next morning, her father sets out on another hopeless day of fishing not knowing his little girl is on board. When he realizes, hes not happy, but theyre too far out to turn back now. Soon, Codi notices something swimming in the sea: a little seal named Tamaka.
Codi explains her familys dire situation to her new friend Tamaka, and the young seal has a solution: she can smell fish a mile away, and she will help Codis father catch the salmon he needs to survive. Together, they follow Tamakas nose and find a miraculous feastbut will it be enough to save Codis fathers fishing business?" />
