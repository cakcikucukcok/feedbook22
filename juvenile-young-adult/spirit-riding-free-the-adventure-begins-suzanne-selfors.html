  <title>Spirit Riding Free: The Adventure Begins - Suzanne Selfors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The thrilling world of DreamWorks Animation&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Spirit Riding Free&lt;/i&gt; is brought to life in award-winning author Suzanne Selfors&#39;s original novel! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Twelve-year-old Lucky Prescott craves adventure, but as a young lady of society she&#39;s only been allowed to experience adventure through books. That is, until one fateful day when Lucky, her father, and her aunt leave their neat-and-tidy city life and travel to their new home out west-the Wild West. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  At first Lucky is excited, but during the long train ride to her new hometown of Miradero, she begins to worry. What if she doesn&#39;t make any new friends? Everyone in the West rides horses, but she&#39;s never been allowed to even sit on one. How can she possibly fit in? Anxious about the future, Lucky looks out the train window and sees a majestic wild stallion. When their eyes meet, she senses a connection. But when the stallion is caught by wranglers, Lucky&#39;s heart breaks. And when she next sees the stallion, he&#39;s tied to a post, refusing to be &quot;broken in.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Spirit Riding Free: The Adventure Begins&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a girl and a wild horse, equally out of place in a strange, new world, but equally fierce and brave. With each other to lean on, will these two free spirits be able to find a home together?" />
