  <title>What Color Is Your Happiness? - Gertilyn Elinor D&#39;Argenzio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael and Sunny, brother and sister, 11 and 10 years
old respectively
Had a dream last night, an Angel Boy of brilliant golden white
light appeared to them. He asked them a question and said they
are to have their answer tomorrow.&lt;p&gt;
The next day he appeared again, in time and space at school requesting they
give him the answer to the question he asked of them in the dream last night.
He asked them to be his messengers, to deliver a most important message
to the children of Earth. Only Sunny and Michael see him, not anyone of
their classmates.&lt;p&gt;
Spell bound and transfixed by this amazing Angel Boy before them, they try
to understand what is happening. Suddenly, another angel appears. She is an
Angel Girl, so radiant and beautiful they can hardly even look at her, in fact,
they can hardly breathe.&lt;p&gt;
She stands next to the Angel Boy and begins to speak, as she does, music
fills her voice, and diamond stars of rainbow colors flow and swirl about all
of them.&lt;p&gt;
She says she has come to tell Michael and Sunny their mission as messengers
is to give the children of Earth the secret answer to the questions humankind
has been seeking throughout the ages. She tells them all Earth people must
have the answers at this time. The children will be first to learn the Teachings,
before they may share with the elders.&lt;p&gt;
The Angel Girl says the answer to these questions is happiness, but there is a
clue to finding your happiness.&lt;p&gt;
In their wildest dreams, they could never have imagined the answer they would
give the Angel Boy that day would lead to an unbelievable amazing journey." />
