  <title>Fishies and Froggies in the Drain - April V. Costa, Floyd Ryan Yamyamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is April V Costa.  The title of my book is Fishies and Froggies in the drain.  This story was actually inspired by my two children. Memories are the fondest things. I have changed the story just a bit. My children were both watching their favorite T.V. show.  The story basically  talks about the fear children have about going down the drains in the bathtub. It was very hard to convince my daughter that she was too big to fit down there. My daughter loved fish and frogs. Every day we would walk up the road to the swamp so she could count fish and watch the frogs jump from lily pad to lily pad. It was because of this that I had the idea of fish and frogs at the bottom of the drain just waiting for her soapy water from her bath. It still took a while before she would stay in the tub while her water drained. Most of the time she stood outside the tub and watched the water go down as she would talk down the drain as if they could hear her. My daughter also had the help from her brother as well. Siblings help in the most mysterious ways. Her brother helped with coaching her every night in the hopes she would listen to him and just take her bath.  Knowing that many children suffer from this fear of the drain, I decided to share our story in hopes of helping other children and their parents survive this minor tragedy. I do hope you enjoy the story and find that it helps you and your loved ones along the way.  And dont forget the fish and frogs wait at the bottom of your drains for your soapy water too." />
