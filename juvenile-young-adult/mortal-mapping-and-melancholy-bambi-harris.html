  <title>Mortal Mapping and Melancholy - Bambi Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Penny Lanes afterlife adventures continue at the elite Apollo Academy. Now the bonds of true friendship and loyalty are tested as she faces the hardest lesson of her afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PENNY LANE SURE HAS GONE through a lot since her death. Shes mastered the job of melting, has served as a counselor in a ghost retrieval unit, and had even been thrown into involuntary time travel. Now she is in for the biggest adventure of her life: she is going to school!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penny and her handsome friend, Avery, have been handed their new assignments as students at the elite Apollo Academy, but the biggest lesson for Penny isnt one assigned by any teacher. Penny is about to learn that things dont always go the way she hopes they will. Her closest friend, the archangel Eric, has been sent away on a mysterious mission, and now Avery seems to have lost interest in her. Poor Penny cant ?gure out why all of her other friends back home have mysteriously abandoned her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all hope is lost. As Penny struggles to understand why she has found herself suddenly alone, she is comforted by her new companions, classmates Elly and Alexander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She must try and ?nd the answers before her despair sends her to the underground.&lt;/p&gt;" />
