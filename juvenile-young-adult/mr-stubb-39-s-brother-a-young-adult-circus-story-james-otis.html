  <title>MR STUBB&#39;S BROTHER - A Young Adult Circus Story - James Otis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Otis was the pen name of James Otis Kaler (1848 - 1912), as a journalist he reported on the Civil War and was a prolific author of children&amp;#39;s books, including many a series title. His best known book was &amp;quot;Toby Tyler, or Ten Weeks With a Circus&amp;quot;, written in 1880. Toby Tyler was the first in a trilogy of books about the mischievous youth. &amp;quot;Mr. Stubbs&amp;#39; Brother&amp;quot; is the sequel to &amp;quot;Toby Tyler&amp;quot;, and is also concerned with circus life. James Otis, himself, was involved with a real-life circus as a publicist, so he was able to bring an experienced realism to his story.&lt;br /&gt;
This volume commences with Toby and his gang of friends at a loose end and are trying to think up things to do, until someone suggests that as Toby has circus experience that under his direction they could start a circus. They take advice from Bob Atwood and with a final blessing from Uncle Daniel, the show is on. The boys set about borrowing animals from around the neighbourhood and also select the area on which to hold the event.&lt;br /&gt;
But events overtake them as Toby&amp;rsquo;s old circus rolls into town. He reacquaints himself with old friends and meets the brother of Mr Stubbs, his former pet monkey. And that&amp;rsquo;s when things begin to get interesting&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s profit will be donated to Charities.&lt;br /&gt;
