  <title>LEGEND LAND - A collection of Ancient Legends from the South Western counties of England - Anon E. Mouse, Retold by Lyonesse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume contains 12 ancient legends from the England&amp;rsquo;s West Country of Devon, Cornwall and Wales plus two supplements, &amp;quot;The Furry Day Song&amp;quot; and the iconic &amp;ldquo;Trelawny&amp;rdquo;, also known as &lt;i&gt;The Song of the Western Men&lt;/i&gt;. In this volume you will also find stories like The Mermaid Of Zennor, The Stone Men Of St. Cleer, The Giants Who Built The Mount, How Bala Lake Began and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This small volume was an early form of Great Western&amp;rsquo;s modern day &amp;ldquo;Top 10 Things To Do&amp;rdquo; and gave the rail traveller a list of English, West Country legends to look up and places to see. It is a reissue in book form of the first series of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Line to Legend Land &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;leaflets, originally published by the G.W.R. in 1922.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In older, simpler days, when reading was&amp;nbsp; a rare accomplishment, our many times great-grandparents would gather round the blazing fire of kitchen or hall on the long, dark winter nights and pass away the hours before bedtime in conversation and story-Telling. In some cases a storyteller would visit a village and the whole community would crowd in to the largest room in the settlement to listen to the spoken word. These are a direct recording from the legends spoken by some of the last storytellers of England and endeavour to retain a degree of the vernacular which gives these legends a new life.&lt;br /&gt;
