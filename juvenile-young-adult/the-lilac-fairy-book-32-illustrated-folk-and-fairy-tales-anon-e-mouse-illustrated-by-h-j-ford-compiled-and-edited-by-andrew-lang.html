  <title>THE LILAC FAIRY BOOK - 32 Illustrated Folk and Fairy Tales - Anon E. Mouse,  Illustrated by H. J. Ford, Compiled and Edited by Andrew Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the 12th Fairy Book of Many Colours compiled and edited by Andrew Lang. The stories in all the books are borrowed from many countries &amp;ndash; Ireland, Asia, Portugal, Wales, India, Scotland, Kenya, France and further afield. However much nations differ in policy and culture, they all agree in liking fairy tales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find 32 illustrated fairy tales like The Shifty Lad, The False Prince and the True, The Jogi&amp;#39;s Punishment, The Fairy Nurse, &amp;nbsp;The King of the Waterfalls, A French Puck, &amp;nbsp;Little Lasse, &amp;#39;Moti&amp;#39;, The Enchanted Deer, The Battle of the Birds, The Lady of the Fountain and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stories are further enhanced by 6 coloured plates, 20 full-page pen and ink drawings and 26 In-Text sketches by H. J. Ford.&lt;br /&gt;
This book contains many references to fairies. As to whether there are really any fairies or not, is a difficult question.&amp;nbsp; Andrew Lang never saw any himself, but he knew several people who have seen them-in the Highlands - and heard their music.&amp;nbsp; So, if ever you are near Nether Lochaber, go to the Fairy Hill, and you may hear the music your-self, but you must go on a fine day&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
