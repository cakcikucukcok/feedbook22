  <title>Herbert&#39;s Wormhole: AeroStar and the 3 1/2-Point Plan of Vengeance - Peter Nelson, Rohitash Rao</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Readers of Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Big Nate will love &lt;em&gt;Herbert&#39;s Wormhole 3: Aerostar and the 3 1/2-Point Plan of Vengeance&lt;/em&gt;, the thrilling and irreverent conclusion to the series that began with &lt;em&gt;Herbert&#39;s Wormhole&lt;/em&gt;, which J. K. Rowling called &quot;absolutely wonderful&amp;#8212;fast-paced, inventive, engaging, and hilarious.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbert, Alex, and Sammi were pretty sure their adventures in the future were over&amp;#8212;until they discover that their old nemesis, GOR-DON, has come back to present-day Merwinsville to mess with things. And he&#39;s not alone. He is working for an evil genius, perhaps the greatest villain our heroes have yet faced&amp;#8212;Sammi&#39;s future self, a.k.a. Aerostar, a power-mad, vengeance-fueled tyrant with twisted delusions of superheroism. This 111-year-old was the president of ClemCorp, the company responsible for trashing the Earth, the company the G&#39;Daliens destroyed to save it, and now she wants revenge. And it&#39;s going to be up to our heroes to once again don the mantle of the AlienSlayers and somehow try to save the past, present, and future from total annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
