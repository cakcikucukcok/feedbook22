  <title>Cool Like That: A So For Real Novel - Nikki Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Let the fireworks begin.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that she&#39;s been accepted into a summer enrichment program in New York City, Gia knows she&#39;s going to have the flyest summer ever. Especially since her mom and her annoying stepsister won&#39;t be around. And best of all? Her best friend, Ricky, is joining her so they&#39;re going to spend the entire summer together. Gia hopes Ricky&#39;s finally going to make a move on her, but it seems like Ricky&#39;s bent on playing it safe--too safe, as far as Gia&#39;s concerned. So when Rashad, a cutie from the summer program, starts to get his flirt on with Gia, she&#39;s got a new crush--and Ricky&#39;s so not cool with that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Gia makes me want to holler out loud--she knows how to think for herself and she definitely has enough drama to fill a thousand pages!&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Michelle Stimpson, &lt;i&gt;Essence&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#169; bestselling author on the &lt;i&gt;So For Real &lt;/i&gt; series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Nikki Carter is a fresh, new voice.&quot;&lt;br&gt;?
