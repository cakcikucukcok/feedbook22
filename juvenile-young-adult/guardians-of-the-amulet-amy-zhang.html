&lt;p&gt;Nyx didnt do anything wrong. But at the same time she committed a sin. The Raven awakened her, and it destroyed her and her sanity. Can her descendants stop it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelique was a placeholdera pawn. But she was cunning and had a role to play, even if it was just as a guide. Dont overlook this petite French magician. It might just be the last thing that you do &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three women share an interwoven destiny. Spanning three eras and encompassing two worlds, they are brought together by a secret, a prophecy and an enemy as old as time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
