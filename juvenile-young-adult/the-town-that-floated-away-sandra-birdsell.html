  <title>The Town That Floated Away - Sandra Birdsell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Things are proceeding normally during the annual Spring Break in the town of Wellington (major industries: donuts, grapes and toy boats). Chunks of ice as big as bulldozers flow down the river and Madame Galosh, owner of the Galosh Boot Manufacturing Company, prepares to sell a boatload of new rubber boots. At the same time, the lucky winner of the annual Spring Break Free Trip draw, Virginia Potts, is eager to embark on a long-awaited journey. Clang! Clang! Clang! A bell rings in the town square and an amazing series of events unfolds: too much lemonade is consumed, there&#39;s a little too much enthusiasm for the pursuit of profit and the town fails to mark the age-old &quot;Batten Down the Hatches&quot; holiday -- and the town of Wellington floats away. Ginny Potts is left behind, slowly shrinking from loneliness. In the tradition of Roald Dahl, Sandra Birdsell&#39;s debut children&#39;s novel is outrageously delicious reading, a clear-eyed and often poignant child&#39;s-eye perspective on an adult world -- where the adults are often the silly ones who don&#39;t always know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;" />
