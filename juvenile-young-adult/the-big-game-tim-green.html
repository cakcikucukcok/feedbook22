  <title>The Big Game - Tim Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author and former NFL defensive end Tim Green encourages readers to fight for their dreams in this heartfelt story about a young football star grappling with the stress of living up to his father&amp;#8217;s name. Perfect for fans of Mike Lupica!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny Owens is dedicating his seventh-grade season to his Super Bowl champion father, who recently passed away. Danny promises everyone that, just like his dad, he&amp;#8217;ll dominate the big game at the end of the season and earn a spot on the high school varsity team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then his English teacher catches him cheating on a test. Even though Danny can retake it, he knows there&amp;#8217;s no point. He can&amp;#8217;t read. And if Danny can&amp;#8217;t pass this class, he won&amp;#8217;t be eligible to play in the championship game that could unlock his future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his resentment rises against the only person willing to help him win off the field, the pressure to succeed begins to weigh heavily on Danny&amp;#8217;s shoulders. Danny is being tested on every level now, and to pass, he may very well have to choose a different path from his father&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;" />
