  <title>Pancho Rabbit and the Coyote - Duncan Tonatiuh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;In this allegorical picture book, a young rabbit named Pancho eagerly awaits his papa&amp;rsquo;s return. Papa Rabbit traveled north two years ago to find work in the great carrot and lettuce fields to earn money for his family. When Papa does not return, Pancho sets out to find him. He packs Papa&amp;rsquo;s favorite meal&amp;mdash;mole, rice and beans, a heap of warm tortillas, and a jug of aguamiel&amp;mdash;and heads north. He meets a coyote, who offers to help Pancho in exchange for some of Papa&amp;rsquo;s food. They travel together until the food is gone and the coyote decides he is still hungry . . . for Pancho!&lt;BR /&gt;Duncan Tonatiuh brings to light the hardship and struggles faced by thousands of families who seek to make better lives for themselves and their children by illegally crossing the border.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;Pancho Rabbit and the Coyote&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;STARRED REVIEWS&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;quot;Tonatiuh&amp;rsquo;s great strength is in the text. No word is wasted, as each emotion is clearly and poignantly expressed. The rabbits&amp;rsquo; future is unknown, but their love and faith in each other sustains them through it all. Accessible for young readers, who may be drawn to it as they would a classic fable; perfect for mature readers and the classroom, where its layers of truth and meaning can be peeled back to be examined and discussed. An incandescent, humane and terribly necessary addition to the immigrant-story shelf.&amp;quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/I&gt;, starred review&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;quot;In both prose and art, Tonatiuh expertly balances folkloric elements with stark, modern realities; Pancho Rabbit&amp;rsquo;s trip has the feel of a classic fable or fairy tale, with the untrustworthy coyote demanding more and more of him.&amp;quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/I&gt;, starred review&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;quot;The book shows the fragility of making a living, the desperation that many migrants experience, and the deep family ties that bind the characters.
