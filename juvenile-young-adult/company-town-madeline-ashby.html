  <title>Company Town - Madeline Ashby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2017 Winner of the Sunburst Award Society&#39;s Copper Cylinder Adult Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2017 Canada Reads Finalist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2017 Locus Award Finalist for Science Fiction Novel Category&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2017 Sunburst Award Finalist for Adult Fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2017 Aurora Awards Finalist for Best Novel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Madeline Ashby&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Company Town&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant, twisted mystery, as one woman must evaluate saving the people of a town that can&#39;t be saved, or saving herself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Elegant, cruel, and brutally perfect, &lt;i&gt;Company Town&lt;/i&gt; is a prize of a novel.&quot; --Mira Grant, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling and Hugo-Award nominated author of the Newsflesh series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Arcadia is a city-sized oil rig off the coast of the Canadian Maritimes, now owned by one very wealthy, powerful, byzantine family: Lynch Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hwa is of the few people in her community (which constitutes the whole rig) to forgo bio-engineered enhancements. As such, she&#39;s the last truly organic person left on the rig--making her doubly an outsider, as well as a neglected daughter and bodyguard extraordinaire. Still, her expertise in the arts of self-defense and her record as a fighter mean that her services are yet in high demand. When the youngest Lynch needs training and protection, the family turns to Hwa. But can even she protect against increasingly intense death threats seemingly coming from another timeline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a series of interconnected murders threatens the city&#39;s stability and heightens the unease of a rig turning over. All signs point to a nearly invisible serial killer, but all of the murders seem to lead right back to Hwa&#39;s front door. Company Town has never been the safest place to be--but now, the danger is personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
