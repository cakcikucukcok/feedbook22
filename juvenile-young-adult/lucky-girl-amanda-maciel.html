  <title>Lucky Girl - Amanda Maciel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucky Girl &lt;/em&gt;is an unflinching exploration of beauty, self-worth, and sexual assault, from the author of the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Tease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosie is a beautiful girl&amp;#8212;and it&amp;#8217;s always been enough. Boys crush on her, men stare at her, girls (begrudgingly) admire her. She&amp;#8217;s lucky and she knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s the start of a new school year and she begins to realize that she wants to be more. Namely, she&amp;#8217;s determined to be better to her best friend, Maddie, who&amp;#8217;s just back from a summer program abroad having totally blossomed into her own looks. Rosie isn&amp;#8217;t thrilled when Maddie connects with a football player who Rosie was hooking up with&amp;#8212;but if it makes her friend happy, she&amp;#8217;s prepared to get over it. Plus, someone even more interesting has moved to town: Alex, who became semifamous after he stopped a classmate from carrying out a shooting rampage at his old high school. Rosie is drawn to Alex in a way she&amp;#8217;s never experienced before&amp;#8212;and she is surprised to discover that, unlike every other guy, he seems to see more to her than her beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then at a party one night, in the midst of a devastating storm, something happens that tears apart Rosie&amp;#8217;s life and sets her on a journey of self-discovery that forces her to face uncomfortable truths about reputation, identity, and what it means to be a true friend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
