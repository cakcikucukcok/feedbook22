  <title>Sonny and the Heroic Deeds - Jennifer Hashmi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Further Adventures of Sonny, Gogo, and Tobo the boys were older and growing in their understanding of the world, or that is to say, their two worlds, ours and the archipelago of islands in the sky where Gogo and Tobo lived. One day on a visit to our world Gogo had met Sonny and they had become fast friends. From then on Gogo would take Sonny back to his home nearly every weekend. In this third book the boys are older again. The twelfth birthday is a significant mile-stone in the Islands. Along with their regular schooling children must start to train for the work they will do as adults. Sonny receives a wholly unexpected offer. If he accepts he must face three tests of his aptitude for such a life. In Sonny and the Heroic Deeds we read about the challenges he and Gogo face together. They evaluate their sensitivity in handling a deeply emotional issue, their understanding of economic realities in the Islands, and look at a personal dilemma which can be resolved only by outside intervention. These tests reflect the realities faced by young people everywhere as they emerge from the protective chrysalis of childhood." />
