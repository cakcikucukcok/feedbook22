  <title>The Humming Room - Ellen Potter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hiding is Roo Fanshaw&#39;s special skill. Living in a frighteningly unstable family, she often needs to disappear at a moment&#39;s notice. When her parents are murdered, it&#39;s her special hiding place under the trailer that saves her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Roo, much to her surprise, has a wealthy if eccentric uncle, who has agreed to take her into his home on Cough Rock Island. Once a tuberculosis sanitarium for children of the rich, the strange house is teeming with ghost stories and secrets. Roo doesn&#39;t believe in ghosts or fairy stories, but what are those eerie noises she keeps hearing? And who is that strange wild boy who lives on the river? People are lying to her, and Roo becomes determined to find the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the best efforts of her uncle&#39;s assistants, Roo discovers the house&#39;s hidden room--a garden with a tragic secret. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tale full of unusual characters and mysterious secrets is a story that only Ellen Potter could write. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Humming Room&lt;/i&gt; was inspired by &lt;i&gt;The Secret Garden&lt;/i&gt;, a classic that Ellen Potter has reread every year of her adult life. See how these two works complement each other with this special e-book bonus - the entire text of Frances Hodgson Burnett&#39;s original novel. Just keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;" />
