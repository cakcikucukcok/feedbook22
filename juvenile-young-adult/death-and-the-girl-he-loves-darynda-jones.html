  <title>Death and the Girl He Loves - Darynda Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Darynda Jones, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Death and the Girl Next Door&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Death, Doom &amp;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Detention&lt;/i&gt;, comes &lt;i&gt;Death and the Girl He Loves&lt;/i&gt;, the exciting third book in her new young adult series Darklight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of the world is not something a girl wants on her shoulders, and that is especially true for Lorelei McAlister.  Unfortunately for her, that is exactly where the world&#39;s fate has decided to take up residence. Lorelei has seen firsthand the horrors that lie beneath our everyday world. And those horrors are getting her friends killed. Because of this, she agrees to leave the sanctity of her hometown and is sent to a different world entirely. A boarding school. But even here she is being watched. Someone knows what she is. What she carries inside her soul.  And on top of that she&#39;s seeing visions.  This is nothing new for Lorelei.  But these visions are something more: death, destruction, and the end of the world.   Lorelei must face the fact that there are people who want her dead, and no matter where she goes, no matter how far she runs, the lives of her friends and family are in mortal peril.  Lucky for her, her friends and family include the handsome Angel of Death, a fiercely protective half-angel, and a ragtag group of loyal supporters who aren&#39;t afraid to get a little dirty in the name of fighting pure evil.&lt;/p&gt;" />
