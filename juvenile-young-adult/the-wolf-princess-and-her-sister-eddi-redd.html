  <title>The Wolf Princess and Her Sister - Eddi Redd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wolf Princess and her Sister &lt;/em&gt;are twins that were born under two very differant stars, one dark, one bright. When an enemy discovers this, he plans to use them in his conquest of the land, for a person born under a dark star must certainly have an evil destiny. When their castle is conquered the two sisters are forced to find a way to escape into the nearby forest. With the aid of an unlikely friend and a blind woodsman, the Wolf Princess and her Sister set off to seek out their distant relatives and ask for their assistance in reclaiming their occupied home. But their enemy has sent out his men to recapture them, and will stop at nothing to make them his prisoners again. As they travel, the Wolf Princess cant help but wonder, do the stars truly effect your destiny? If so, can one change their destiny? One thing is certain, that when they face thier enemy, Laird Griff Cray, the Wolf Princess, her Sister, and all of their allies will be outnumbered, and in for the fight of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
