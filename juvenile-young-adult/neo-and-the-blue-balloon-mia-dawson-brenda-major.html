  <title>Neo and the Blue Balloon - Mia Dawson, Brenda Major</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Neo is just about to turn six, and he already knows how hard it can be to make new friends. One day, while sitting outside, he spots a balloon-the bluest balloon he&#39;s ever seen-trapped in the tree in his front yard. Neo makes it his mission to rescue the balloon, and then, he and the balloon can be best friends forever. This proves more difficult than he thought ...   First, Neo meets a hungry squirrel in search of hidden nuts. The squirrel&#39;s name is Bob, and Bob promises to help Neo get his balloon if Neo helps him find his snack stash. To Neo&#39;s dismay, the tree doesn&#39;t like being climbed and even complains about lost leaves.   Just as Neo thinks he might be able to rescue his would-be new friend the blue balloon, the sturdy tree becomes a dangerous obstacle. Neo is in trouble. He&#39;ll hurt himself if someone doesn&#39;t come to his rescue-and to the rescue of his special balloon. Who will save him? Well, a friend, of course, because that&#39;s what real friends are all about!" />
