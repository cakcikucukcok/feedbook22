      <meta name="description" content="Illusions
Fifteen- year- old Chance thought he&#39;d seen it all. He&#39;d been to war, his best friend&#39;s a psychic, and he&#39;s constantly being attacked by the Intimate Illusions- hypnotized zombies caught between life and death that can&#39;t seem to be released. To cap it all off, he and his brother&#39;s own powers seem to be acting up, his hometown&#39;s been cut off from the rest of the Kingdom of Frost, and his father&#39;s missing. Things can&#39;t get much worse, right?
Wrong.
Mysteries
The Illusions have been coming in droves. After a storm hits the island, an onslaught of them attack, leaving Chance and his friends questioning whether rumors of a traitor are true. Chance begins doubting everything... And when the storm washes a mysterious girl named Alix who wields a strange gem called a Wishing Shard ashore, Chance has more questions than ever.
Alix
When Illusions once again attack, kidnapping his best friend and destroying his home, Chance has no choice but to accompany the only person with answers- Alix- to Mainland Frost. There, mysteries unfold, secrets are made, and promises are broken. Can Chance trust anyone... even himself?" />
