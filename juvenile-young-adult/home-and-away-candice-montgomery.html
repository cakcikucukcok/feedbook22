  <title>Home and Away - Candice Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Montgomery&#39;s thoughtful craft is driven by immediacy and tension and grounded in emotional authenticity. ... A love letter to the intricacies of family and multitudinous black girlhood.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, starred&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Home and Away&lt;/i&gt; shines a multicolored light on the myriad meanings of &#39;family&#39; and how each plays a role in shaping who we are, what we do, and who we become. I didn&#39;t want it to end!&quot; -- Nic Stone, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Dear Martin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasia Quirk is young, Black, and fabulous. She&#39;s a senior, she&#39;s got great friends, and a supportive and wealthy family. She even plays football as the only girl on her private high school&#39;s team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she catches her mamma trying to stuff a mysterious box in the closet, her identity is suddenly called into question. Now Tasia&#39;s determined to unravel the lies that have overtaken her life. Along the way, she discovers what family and forgiveness really mean, and that her answers don&#39;t come without a fee. An artsy bisexual boy from the Valley could help her find them--but only if she stops fighting who she is, beyond the color of her skin.&lt;/p&gt;" />
