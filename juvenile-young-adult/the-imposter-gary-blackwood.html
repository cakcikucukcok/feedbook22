  <title>The Imposter - Gary Blackwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At 14 years old, Ryan Waite is not a bad actor -- in fact he&#39;s quite a good one. But when he messes up an audition for a part in Les Mis, he comes into contact with a character named Burton who launches the boy into the most challenging role of his life. You see, Burton is a private investigator out to make some big money the shady way. And he wants Ryan to impersonate the long lost son of a millionaire who is desperate to reconnect with his son before he dies. Suddenly, Ryan finds himself performing a part considerably beyond his depth, having to improvise complicated lies just in order to stay ahead of the game. Ryan knows discovery is inevitable and when the moment arrives, he has to dig deep to find the most graceful and honourable way of making his exit." />
