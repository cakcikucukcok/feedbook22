In fact, football saved Isaiah&amp;#8217;s life, giving him structure and discipline after his sister&amp;#8217;s death tore his family apart. But when Isaiah gets knocked out cold on the field, he learns there&amp;#8217;s a lot more to lose than football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While recovering from a concussion, Isaiah wonders what his life would look like without the game. All his friends are on the team, and Isaiah knows they can&amp;#8217;t win without him. The scholarship offer from Cornell is only on the table if he keeps playing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And without football, what would keep his family together? What would prevent him from sliding back into the habits that nearly destroyed him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaiah must decide how much he&amp;#8217;s willing to sacrifice for the sport that gave him everything, even if playing football threatens to take away his future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
