  <title>Learning Adventures of  Toby Brown - Annabelle Love-Whitinger, Juan Pablo Cruz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After telling the stories they were remembered and later written down. In the year 1972 over 30 years ago, she began to type them on a typewriter (old at that time) with some missing keys and very hard to read 12 pt. type. 
The stories have a main character, and some of his friends. A little boy about 3rd level in school, experiences some situations common to all of us. 
This collection of very short stories is primarily to help us process some important emotions as we grow in experience sometimes unusual situations. The author being an only child, as experienced many days of being alone and therefore has had some imaginary friends or animated objects such as the little engine with thoughts. Dont be surprised, we have all been there period." />
