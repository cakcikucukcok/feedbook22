  <title>My Favorite Place - Kathryn Heist Sasse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here is a highly imaginative and superbly illustrated book that will capture the heart of any child and win the attention of any adult who has not lost the art of viewing the world with joy and wonderment  a talent with which children seem to have been blessed in abundance.  On the surface the book recounts the visits of a young boy, Matthew, to the park and describes the various reasons why he decides to make it the topic of a school essay. However, in the hands of Kathryn Heist Sasse, such mundane activities as watching ducks, flying a kite, playing on swings, and riding the merry-go-round take on magical luminescence.  The exquisite illustrations set the scenes with great feeling and enchantment. They further the narrative in an appealing manner as little Matthew describes his activities and shares his dreams and prayers. The drawings themselves are charming in their delicacy and are strongly reminiscent of the great childrens classics.  My Favorite Place reveals a comforting understanding of the childs mind and spirit. Its warmhearted stress on the finer details of life for all living things and its captivating blend of beautiful illustrations with a charming narrative make it a book that will be a treasured addition to any childs library for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
