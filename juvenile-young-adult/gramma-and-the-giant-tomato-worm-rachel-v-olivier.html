  <title>Gramma and the Giant Tomato Worm - Rachel V. Olivier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Euw, it&#39;s got dirt on it, Aunt Morgan.&quot; The twelve year old pushed the cherry tomato away, tossing her brown, curly hair out of her eyes. Morgan wiped the offensive tomato off on her shirt and put it back in the girl&#39;s hands.    &quot;Don&#39;t be such a baby, Lucia. A little dirt never hurt anyone. And see, it&#39;s all warm and juicy from the sun. Try it. Don&#39;t worry. It won&#39;t bite.&quot;    Lucia is spending the weekend with her Aunt Morgan, giving her parents some much-needed childfree time. What she learns from Aunt Morgan about her family could forever change how she sees gardening, and her family.    Like how her great-grandmother once went face-to-face with a tomato worm as big as a house!    This story was previously published in Beyond Centauri. It has been slightly updated to be republished in this single-book format.     Don&#39;t expect professional level illustrations in this little book. Do expect to have fun reading the story and seeing how I envisioned it." />
