  <title>The Big Top Birthday - Mary C. Bolduc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To the Parents of the Readers,
I hope you enjoy this story as much as I believe your child will.
As I wrote &quot;The Big top Birthday&quot;, I saw throughout the story a focus on bonds of friendship and trust; as well as on commonality in the midst of difference.  In this story, a common bond of friendship is formed between all of the boys and girls invited to Kiki&#39;s party.  
There are some other, more subtle learnings in all of the &quot;My Friends and I&quot; stories that I hope will present themselves to your child.    Examples of these learnings in this story may be seen in the light of handling disabilities, play with others and caring for others.    
With each story, I have tried to share something with your child that will not only be a source of enjoyment for them, but a source of learning as well." />
