  <title>WILLIE THE MOUSE - a Children&#39;s Moonlight Adventure - Alta Tabor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Willie the Mouse had often hear his parents say &amp;ldquo;the Moon was made of Green Cheese&amp;rdquo; and one evening he thought he would see for himself if this were indeed true.&lt;br /&gt;
So, he packed up a piece of cheese and a crust of bread, and, taking his lantern, set out on his travels.&lt;br /&gt;
On his way he met his friend Mr Woodmouse and Jenny Wren who&amp;nbsp; said one evening she had flown ever so high but didn&amp;#39;t seem to get any nearer.&lt;br /&gt;
He also met Mr Squirrel and Mrs Mole who both said they didn&amp;rsquo;t think he would succeed, but he knew he had to try for himself.&lt;br /&gt;
Out in the moonlight, while the owls were hooting, he also met a very special, magical being. But who was this special being? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download this book and find out for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;
A children&amp;rsquo;s adventure by moonlight &amp;ndash; the story is well written by Alta Tabor and exquisitely illustrated by Florence White Williams with 22 illustrations, 10 of which are in colour.&lt;br /&gt;
