  <title>Tiger&#39;s Fall - Molly Bang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A feisty little girl learns that physical disability can&#39;t limit her ability to make a difference.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lupe loves nothing better than riding her father&#39;s horse, El Diablo. Fearless and agile, she rampages around her rural village in Mexico like a &lt;i&gt;tigrilla &lt;/i&gt;(little tiger), which is her father&#39;s nickname for her.  But one day Lupe falls while climbing a tree. Paralyzed from the waist down, she will never again be able to ride El Diablo. Her life might as well be over, she thinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first Lupe is filled with rage and self-pity. Her family brings her to a center run by and for disabled people, to recuperate. Despite the evidence around her, she refuses to believe that disabled people can be happy and self-sufficient, and she can&#39;t believe that these people think their lives are worth living. But slowly the people and the spirit of the center help Lupe realize that she, too, has something to offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning author/illustrator Molly Bang brings emotional honesty and bravery to this compelling, fact-based story of coming to terms with disability.&lt;/p&gt;" />
