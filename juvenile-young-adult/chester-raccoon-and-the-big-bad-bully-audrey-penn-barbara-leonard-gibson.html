  <title>Chester Raccoon and the Big Bad Bully - Audrey Penn, Barbara Leonard Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In this latest addition to the Kissing Hand book collection, Chester Raccoon must learn to deal with another common problem of childhood: a bully at school.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Mrs. Raccoon learns that there is a bully problem at school, she decides to investigate the situation. But after seeing the bully for herself, she shares a story about a forest that was full of smooth yellow stones, and how the animals living there changed a pointy stone they found into a smooth stone so that it wouldn&#39;t hurt any tender paws.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chester, Ronny, and Cassy follow the spirit of Mrs. Raccoon&#39;s story when they next encounter the Bully. Approaching him as a group, they invite him to play, proving that the best way to get rid of an enemy is to make him or her a friend.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book encourages children to understand that many child bullies are themselves unhappy and gives readers a good example of settling differences by peaceful means. Educators will embrace this story about a positive strategy for dealing with a bully.&lt;/div&gt;" />
