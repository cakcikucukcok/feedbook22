  <title>Peregrine Puffin - Indigo Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peregrine, the Atlantic Puffin - Pippin as he likes to call himself - has a secret: hes being bullied. Maybe if he had more friends it wouldnt bother him so much, but how can you make friends when you are supposed to spend all your time out at sea, catching herring? He would much rather be at home in his burrow, growing blackberries on his wild and windy cliff-top. Then, one day, in the middle of a very trying day for Pippin at Spring School, the bully who makes his life a misery finds himself in a life and death struggle. Will Pippin forgive him? Will Pippin save him? 
Read about the day that changed a young birds life and started a whole community on the road to lasting friendship and the quest for a safe and healthy ocean for all." />
