  <title>A Whole New Ballgame - Phil Bildner, Tim Probert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rip and Red are best friends whose fifth-grade year is nothing like what they expected. They have a crazy new tattooed teacher named Mr. Acevedo, who doesn&#39;t believe in tests or homework and who likes off-the-wall projects, the more &quot;off&quot; the better. They also find themselves with a new basketball coach: Mr. Acevedo! Easy-going Rip is knocked completely out of his comfort zone. And for Red, who has autism and really needs things to be exactly a certain way, the changes are even more of a struggle. But together these two make a great duo who know how to help each other--and find ways to make a difference--in the classroom and on the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            With its energetic and authentic story and artwork, this is a fresh, fun book about school, sports, and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This title has Common Core connections.&lt;/p&gt;" />
