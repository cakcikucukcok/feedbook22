  <title>Modern Dog Parenting - Sarah Hodgson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You and your dog are a lot alike. By several behavioral measures, your dog&#39;s mental abilities are equivalent to those of a two to three and a half-year-old toddler. Dogs can learn up to 250 words, count from one to five and understand basic arithmetic. Your dog can imitate and understand your behavior and has a sense of fairness. Doesn&#39;t it make sense to treat these sensitive, intelligent creatures a bit more like children? Kids--and dogs--raised with kindness and respect grow up happy. And happy is good. &lt;i&gt;Modern Dog Parenting&lt;/i&gt; will show readers that yes, you can love your dog and live with him, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs (and the people who love them) are tired of the school of dominant, top-dog training. They are looking for a new kind of pack leader: someone funny, enthusiastic, intuitive, approachable, and, above all, effective. And they&#39;ve found her. Sarah Hodgson rejects dominance-based training and gets astonishing results with a blend of wit, compassion, energy, and proven skills. She communicates instructions clearly, directs behavior compassionately, and rewards success lavishly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topics include:&lt;br&gt;*Understanding the signs your dog is giving you&lt;br&gt;*Having fun while learning manners&lt;br&gt;*How to fit your dog into your lifestyle&lt;br&gt;*How to communicate lovingly and effectively with your dog&lt;/p&gt;" />
