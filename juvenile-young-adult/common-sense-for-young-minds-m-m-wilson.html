  <title>Common Sense for Young Minds - M.M Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Raising children today is challenging for parents.  But it is also equally demanding to be a child growing up in today&#39;s society.  Today&#39;s children are constantly bombarded with information overload and they are always asking a lot of questions.  As young children are always looking up to someone to answer questions, honestly and respectfully, &lt;I&gt;Common Sense for Young Minds: The Tween Companion Book, Series I&lt;/I&gt; is not a pretence book, but answers questions honestly inside the pages of the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 
&lt;I&gt;Common Sense for Young Minds&lt;/I&gt; offers an open mind, for children to seek out and ask questions, without the fear of being taken advantage of by someone for self-interest, or taking advantage of the vulnerability of a child&#39;s point of view.  Many children in this book are your own ages, and they share the same values, speak the same language and ask the same questions.  This book will give you the best possible answers to the questions and concerns children may have, including family and their health.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
Enjoy these short, seventeen easy-to-read stories about children and families from the following countries:  Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, China, Egypt, England, Germany, Greece, India, Iraq, Jamaica, Malawi, Russia Federation, South Africa, West Africa and the United States.  These stories will make both adults and children smile, and children will feel a part of this book for a lifetime." />
