  <title>The Mystery of Hollow Places - Rebecca Podos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mystery of Hollow Places &lt;/em&gt;is a gorgeously written, stunningly original novel of love, loss, and identity, from debut author Rebecca Podos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Imogene Scott knows of her mother is the bedtime story her father told her as a child. It&amp;#8217;s the story of how her parents met: he, a forensic pathologist; she, a mysterious woman who came to identify a body. A woman who left Imogene and her father when she was a baby, a woman who was always possessed of a powerful loneliness, a woman who many referred to as &amp;#8220;troubled waters.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Imogene is seventeen, and her father, a famous author of medical mysteries, has struck out in the middle of the night and hasn&amp;#8217;t come back. Neither Imogene&amp;#8217;s stepmother nor the police know where he could&amp;#8217;ve gone, but Imogene is convinced he&amp;#8217;s looking for her mother. And she decides it&amp;#8217;s up to her to put to use the skills she&amp;#8217;s gleaned from a lifetime of reading her father&amp;#8217;s books to track down a woman she&amp;#8217;s only known in stories in order to find him and, perhaps, the answer to the question she&amp;#8217;s carried with her for her entire life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
