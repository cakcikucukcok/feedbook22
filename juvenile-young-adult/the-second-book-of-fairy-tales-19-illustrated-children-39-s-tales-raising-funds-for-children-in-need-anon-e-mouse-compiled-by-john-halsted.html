  <title>THE SECOND BOOK OF FAIRY TALES - 19 illustrated children&#39;s tales raising funds for Children in Need - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by John Halsted</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has been especially re-published to raise funds for the BBC&amp;rsquo;s Children in Need Appeal. The stories herein were originally published over a century ago. Some will be familiar fare and others less familiar, but all are entertaining and appealing nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 19 illustrated stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Sleeping Beauty In The Wood&lt;br /&gt;
Prince Hyacinth And The Dear Little Princess&lt;br /&gt;
Cinderella Or The Little Glass Slipper&lt;br /&gt;
East Of The Sun And West Of The Moon&lt;br /&gt;
Rumpelstiltzkin&lt;br /&gt;
The Tale Of A Youth Who Set Out To Learn&amp;nbsp; What Fear Was&lt;br /&gt;
Lovely Ilonka&lt;br /&gt;
Beauty And The Beast&lt;br /&gt;
Lucky Luck&lt;br /&gt;
Why The Sea Is Salt&lt;br /&gt;
The Master Cat Or Puss In Boots&lt;br /&gt;
The Six Swans&lt;br /&gt;
The Prince And The Dragon&lt;br /&gt;
The Dragon Of The North&lt;br /&gt;
Little Wildrose&lt;br /&gt;
The Nixy&lt;br /&gt;
The Glass Mountain&lt;br /&gt;
Fairer-Than-A-Fairy&lt;br /&gt;
The White Duck&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The words &amp;#39;Fairy Tales&amp;#39; must be taken to include tales in which something &amp;#39;fairy&amp;#39;, something extraordinary occurs -- fairies, giants, dwarfs, speaking animals. One cannot imagine a child saying, &amp;#39;Tell me a folk-tale&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;Another nursery tale, please, grandma&amp;#39;.&amp;nbsp; It must also be taken to cover tales in which something magical happens. Mostly it is the comical stupidity of some of the actors, as is so common in moral tales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In buying this book you will be giving in more than one way. Once to the Children in Need appeal and again, to yourself, as you read and enjoy stories not read for many a year. But should you perchance happen to read these stories to your children, nieces and nephews or grand-children, you will be giving yet again. 50% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to the appeal.&lt;br /&gt;
So take some time out and travel back to a period before television, or even radio for that matter, when families would gather around a crackling and spitting hearth and granddad or grandma&amp;nbsp; or an uncle or aunt would delight and captivate their audience with stories passed on to them from their mothers, fathers and grandparents.&lt;br /&gt;
