  <title>Lil Joshua and Lil Mohammed: Stop the Bullying Now - Christian Muhammed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lil Joshua and Lil Mohammed: Stop the Bullying Now! is a call to arms for every man, woman, and child to confront bullies wherever they find them.
	As a result of bullying and excessive teasing, our children are killing themselves, and they are often targets of physical attacks. Even though teasing may be tolerated to a certain extent, any type of physical abuse cant be tolerated.
	Lil Joshua and Lil Mohammed let children know that being different doesnt make you weird, but unique, and if everyone was the same, this world would be a very boring place.
	What the boys stress more than anything is bullying must be reported immediately to any and every adult who will listen, especially parents. The bullied child is not the only person who has a responsibility to report incidents of bullying. Anyone who witnesses bullying has a duty to report this deplorable behavior; if they dont report incidents of bullying, they are just as guilty as the bullies themselves.
	Most bullying occurs at school; therefore, we are obligated to help Lil Joshua and Lil Mohammed spread the word that every child has a right to feel safe and secure at school. Every school in the world should be a No Bullying Zone." />
