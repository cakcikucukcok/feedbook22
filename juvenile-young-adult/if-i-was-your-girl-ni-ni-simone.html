  <title>If I Was Your Girl - Ni-Ni Simone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With a bootylicious body like Beyonc&amp;#233; and a face that would put any top model to shame, Toi McKnight has all the cuties coming her way. Who could blame them?  She was always rocking the latest fashion trends and hanging at every bangin&#39; party in the city. But all that came at a price, and now Toi McKnight is the seventeen-year-old mother of a baby boy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Between bills to pay and adult responsibilities to meet, she&#39;s got zero time for sizzling gossip, chilling with her friends or doing the things she used to. So when unexpected sparks start flying between her and six-foot-two, deliciously fine Harlem, Toi knows she&#39;s got to dead any chance of a relationship fast since he doesn&#39;t date teenage mothers--and she&#39;s vowed to never love again. But every time Toi tries to cut Harlem loose, she falls harder for him. And all the other drama in her life doesn&#39;t help the situation any, especially when her son&#39;s father comes back around. Toi tries to do the right thing, but doing the right thing just may put her on heartbreak express for good.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Introducing teen writing sensation &lt;b&gt;Ni-Ni Simone.&lt;/b&gt; With a raw, fresh, and unmistakable voice, she proves herself a force to be reckoned with. Simone lives in New Jersey and is a graduate of Kean University." />
