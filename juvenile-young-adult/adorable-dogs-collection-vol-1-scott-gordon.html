      <meta name="description" content="Four great puppy books for one great price. Over 150 pages! Here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s included:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adorable Dogs: Beagles&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your new dog is one demanding little puppy! Find out what makes him tick in this humorous little book about beagles. Give your child a four-legged surprise without the mess. Guaranteed to make you smile!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adorable Dogs: Bulldogs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How can you not love that face? Meet Marvin&amp;#39;s family, a bunch of droopy-faced bulldogs that are constantly scolded by their overbearing mother. (I swear she has a little pitbull in her!) Can they get past their differences, or will they wind up nagging each other to death?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adorable Dogs: Pugs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So you think it&amp;#39;s funny dressing up your new Pug in a bunch of ridiculous outfits? He doesn&amp;#39;t think so. And he&amp;#39;s certainly not shy about giving you a piece of his mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adorable Dogs: Labradors&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An unwanted puppy finds himself at the local dog pound, baffled by his new surroundings. Visitor after visitor strolls by, but no matter what he does, he&amp;#39;s unable to win their affection. Will he be stuck there forever? Or will someone special come to his rescue?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bonus Content&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A comprehensive list of labrador rescue organizations in the U.S. is included along with a a special interview after the main feature." />
