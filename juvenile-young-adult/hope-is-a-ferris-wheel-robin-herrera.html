  <title>Hope Is a Ferris Wheel - Robin Herrera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Ten-year-old Star Mackie lives in a trailer park with her flaky mom and her melancholy older sister, Winter, whom Star idolizes. Moving to a new town has made it difficult for Star to make friends, when her classmates tease her because of where she lives and because of her layered blue hair. But when Star starts a poetry club, she develops a love of Emily Dickinson and, through Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s poetry, learns some important lessons about herself and comes to terms with her hopes for the future.&lt;BR /&gt; With an unforgettable voice with a lot of heart, &lt;I&gt;Hope Is a Ferris Wheel&lt;/I&gt; is the story of a young girl who learns to accept her family and herself while trying to make sense of the world around her.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;Hope is a Ferris Wheel&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;STARRED REVIEW&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;quot;Herrera&amp;rsquo;s first novel is quite accomplished, with plenty of heart and humor, especially apparent in the spelling assignments Star has to complete but refuses to turn in, as she uses them as a sort of journal. Star is a unique, determined, and loving child making the best of a bad situation; readers cannot help but root for her.&amp;quot;&lt;BR /&gt; --&lt;I&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/I&gt;, starred review&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;quot;Well-constructed, thought-provoking and appealing, this first effort bodes well for the author&amp;rsquo;s future.&amp;quot;&lt;BR /&gt; --&lt;I&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;quot;&lt;/I&gt;In her debut, Herrera has created a delightful narrator with a memorable voice and surrounded her with a unique supporting cast.
