  <title>Doggie Daycare - Hadley West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am 12 year old Hadley West. As you can probably tell, I absolutely love writing and have been writing stories ever since I can remember! I enjoy writing mostly about animals and know for sure that I am going to write more books.
I have lived in Rogers, Arkansas for most of my life and go to a regular school in Bentonville. I own two dogs, a shih tzu named Febe and a yellow Labrador Retriever named Avery just like in my story. I used each of their personalities to create these two very different characters, and each play a key part in my story.
Some people think when they hear about a kid writing a published book that it cant be possible. Here is what I tell them... All things are possible." />
