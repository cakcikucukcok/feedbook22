      <meta name="description" content="This book has a twist to it! 
A story telling a story! 
Mrs. King is reading Glory the Bears book to her class. 
This story is meant for you to use your imaginations to bring the cast of characters to life. Glory the Bears back was always turned to the readers because she would always move forward in believing that she was going to find her mother. When the characters told Glory to go back to where she had first started looking for her mother, it wasnt until the end of the story that you could see her face. The message that I tried to bring out to the readers was that no matter who you are, never give up faith, hope, and your dreams. 
Always go forward in life." />
