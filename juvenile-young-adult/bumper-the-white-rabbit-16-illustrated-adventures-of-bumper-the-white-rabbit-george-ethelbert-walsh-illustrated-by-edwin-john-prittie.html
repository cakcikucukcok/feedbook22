  <title>BUMPER THE WHITE RABBIT - 16 illustrated adventures of Bumper the White Rabbit - George Ethelbert Walsh, Illustrated by Edwin John Prittie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for all little boys and girls who love animals and starts by telling readers where BUMPER THE WHITE RABBIT came from. It also tells of why Bumper was left at home and what happened next &amp;ndash; an adventure second to none!&lt;br /&gt;
