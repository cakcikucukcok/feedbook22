  <title>Vicarious - Paula Stokes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winter Kim and her sister, Rose, have always been inseparable. Together the two of them survived growing up in a Korean orphanage and being trafficked into the United States. But they&#39;ve escaped the past and started over in a new place where no one knows who they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now they work as digital stunt girls for Rose&#39;s ex-boyfriend, Gideon, engaging in dangerous and enticing activities while recording their neural impulses for his Vicarious Sensory Experiences, or ViSEs. Whether it&#39;s bungee jumping, shark diving, or grinding up against celebrities in the city&#39;s hottest dance clubs, Gideon can make it happen for you--for a price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Rose disappears and a ViSE recording of her murder is delivered to Gideon, Winter is devastated. She won&#39;t rest until she finds her sister&#39;s killer. But when the clues she uncovers conflict with the digital recordings her sister made, Winter isn&#39;t sure what to believe. To find out what happened to Rose, she&#39;ll have to untangle what&#39;s real from what only seems real, risking her own life in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paula Stokes weaves together a series of mysteries and the story of an unbreakable bond between sisters in this unforgettable high-tech thrill ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
