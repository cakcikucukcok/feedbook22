  <title>Up a Creek - Laura E. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A thoughtful coming-of-age novel about a young woman struggling to connect with her eccentric mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;I picked up my poster, raising it so everyone could see that if they chopped down these old oak trees, they&#39;d be killing the South as well.  I held it high like I meant it, and I walked around Oak Square forty-six more times that day, till all that was left of the sun was a buttery smear in the sky.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miracle Bott&#39;s activism is a constant embarrassment to her thirteen year old daughter, Starshine.  Why does Miracle spend all her time fighting causes? And how can Starshine&#39;s grandmother remain so supportive? After all, the 60&#39;s were a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Miracle tries to save the whales, then the ozone layer, and now it&#39;s the old oak trees in the town square. But when Miracle decides to protect one of the oaks by living in it, she may have gone too far--too far for the mayor, the community, and especially her daughter. Now Starshine must find a way to make Miracle come down from the tree before their relationship becomes a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her warm, evocative style, Laura Williams explores the relationships between three generations of women struggling to find connections.&lt;/p&gt;" />
