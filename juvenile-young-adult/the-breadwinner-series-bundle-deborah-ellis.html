But she still dreams of seeing the ocean and eventually making a new life in France. This is the dream that has sustained her through the terrible years in Kabul. It is the dream for which she has forsaken family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Name Is Parvana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this stunning sequel to The Breadwinner Trilogy, Parvana, now fifteen, is found in a bombed-out school and held as a suspected terrorist by American troops in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
