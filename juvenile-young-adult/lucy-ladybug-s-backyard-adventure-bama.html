  <title>Lucy Ladybug’S Backyard Adventure - Bama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lucy Ladybug is ready to take five-year-old twins Karsten and Trevor on an unforgettable backyard adventure! Lucy is gifted with a voice and is also magical, for she is able to see the beauty in everything. Karsten and Trevor can hardly wait as they follow Lucy into the grass and the trees and many places in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twins close their eyes so they can see the same things Lucy does with her magical eyes, and they soon find themselves looking at the underside of a toadstool, a spiderweb on a rose bush, and the inside of a dandelion. As they move through the backyard with Lucy Ladybug, they are filled with wonder as they learn why bees are covered in pollen, why Scotty the squirrel worries where he buries his acorns, and why it takes so long to make a birds nest. Karsten and Trevor never knew a backyard adventure could be so exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lucy Ladybugs Backyard Adventure&lt;/i&gt; is an enchanting story woven around a magical ladybug and beautiful macro photography that will teach children everywhere to enjoy all the beautiful aspects of nature and the creatures that call it home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
