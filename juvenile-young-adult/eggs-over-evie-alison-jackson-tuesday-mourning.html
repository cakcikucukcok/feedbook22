  <title>Eggs over Evie - Alison Jackson, Tuesday Mourning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old Evie Carson lives with her mom. In an apartment across the lake, Evie&#39;s celebrity-chef dad is starting a new life with his young second wife, Angie, who&#39;s expecting twins. To make matters worse, Evie&#39;s dad has custody of the beloved family dog. Navigating her new family situation is difficult, and Evie turns to her love of cooking as a way to stay connected to her father. Through cooking classes, Evie finds an unexpected friend in Corey, whose eccentric aunt Shanti might be able to make everyone a little happier. Evie learns to look outside herself, help others, and make friends where she never thought she could (she also learns to make a pretty darn good soufflé!).&lt;/p&gt;" />
