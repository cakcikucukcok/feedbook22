  <title>Freddie, Bill and Irving - Paul Bennett, Kate Shannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Freddie, Bill and Irving are triplets. They are brought up by their Mum, Lillian, in a south-coast seaside town during the 1960s. An argument with a local girl called Marcia leads to retaliation which nearly destroys her home. Freddie, Bill and Irving are sent off to their aunts home on the west coast of Scotland for the rest of the summer, where it is hoped that they will remain out of trouble.
However, the trio and trouble go hand in hand. The journey to Scotland is punctuated by one catastrophe after another, and the boys are soon being tracked down by several victims of their schemes.
Nonetheless, the boys always manage to avoid the consequences of their actions and finally return home as heroes of the hour, almost oblivious to the trail of destruction that they have left in their wake." />
