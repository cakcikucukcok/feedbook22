  <title>Becoming Prince Charming - Stephanie Rankin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What ever became of Prince Charming? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the hero of every damsel that was ever distressed. He slayed dragons, chopped down man-eating vines, and climbed towers of hair to rescue his one true love. He even possessed a kiss that could wake the terminally sleeping. But is that all Prince Charming had to offer? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not according to his beloved little boy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble Fisher cannot wait to grow up and walk in his daddys gallant footsteps. Every day he seeks adventureuntil one rainy April day, when his father sets him on a path to complete a mysterious quest that will determine whether or not little Noble will ever become Prince Charming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first book of the series, Noble is introduced to his quest and, with great excitement and a little trepidation, realizes how difficult it will be to complete a task that is cloaked in such secrecy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents and children will love unlocking the mysteries of the quest while watching Noble grow into knighthood and, ultimately, come to choose whether or not he wants to become Prince Charming. &lt;/p&gt;
