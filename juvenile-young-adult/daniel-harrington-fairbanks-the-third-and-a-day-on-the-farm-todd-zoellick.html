      <meta name="description" content="Daniel Harrington Fairbanks the Third and a Day on the Farm is the third book in a series of rhyming stories about Daniel and his dog Clark.  Daniel and Clark, along with their friend Brooke, visit a farm for the very first time.  They encounter many farm animals and meet the farmers cat, Meow.  Clark is scared of the farm animals and chases the cat because they are different from him.  But eventually Clark comes to realize that even though those animals do not look like him, they all have important roles to playeven Meow the cat.  
The story is an endearing tale about children, dogs, and cats and their exploration of the world around them.  There is a strong message that even though we may be different from one another, all of us have something to offer and can still be friends." />
