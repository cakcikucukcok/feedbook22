      <meta name="description" content="THE PRENTIS, WILLIAMS CHILDREN
BOOK 1:  ALL FOR A REASON  CALVIN PRENTIS 
&lt;b&gt;
Four friends attend the same College and share a residence together.
&lt;b&gt;
Calvin Prentis meets and falls in love with Sarah-Jane, a beautiful, rude and selfish woman! &lt;b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
Jade, who had always loved Calvin, is hurt when she is led to believe that he plans to spend his life with Sarah-Jane so she applies and is accepted for a position that will take her away from the College and away from Calvin.
&lt;b&gt;
When the tearful Jade tells him of her decision to leave he is shocked and bewildered, he spends a night with her in his arms as he tries to console her. The next day he comes home and finds her gone, leaving only a note in which she confesses her love for him. He tries in vain to contact her but which ever way he turns he comes up short.  She has left no forwarding address. 
&lt;b&gt;
The beautiful Sarah-Jane also leaves a note for him, but somehow the simple note from Jade had hurt him deeper and meant more. He realises that it was Jade he loved all along, but has his realisation come too late? 
&lt;b&gt;
With a small fortune left to him in a trust fund by his Grand parents, he purchases a property and starts his own business. He tries once more to find Jade only to discover that there is another man in her lift. Heart broken he returns home pouring himself into his business and his dance studio.
&lt;b&gt;
How can he bridge the gap that came between them? How can he prove his love to her, and set things right? &lt;b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
BOOK 2: WHERE DO YOU GO TO MY LOVELY  MAURICE AND NAKITA WILLIAMS
&lt;b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
Maurice and Nakita:  the children of Paula and Barry Williams. &lt;b&gt;
Maurice a Paediatrician and Nakita, a Physiotherapist and Beautician live together in Umhlanga where they run a private Clinic and practice the unusual past time of restoring veteran cars. 
&lt;b&gt;
Brought up in a family where music and dance was as important as breathing, Nakita uses her musical talent as therapy in much of her treatment of patients. 
&lt;b&gt;
When Maurice receives a call from Lizzy, an extremely gifted five year old patient that he had been treating for an ear infection, requesting his help, both their lives are changed for ever! 
&lt;b&gt;
Is history about to repeat itself? Are the Doctors capable of handling what life has thrown in their path?
Will Nakitas shock at the abuse of this child make her more determined to find out the cause? 
&lt;b&gt;
What will be the response of the uncle this family so desperately needs? 
&lt;b&gt;
Love, intrigue and sorrow abound as the doctors set out to fulfil more than their Hippocratic Oath!" />
