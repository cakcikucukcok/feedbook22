  <title>Parvana’s Journey - Deborah Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second book in the internationally-bestselling series that includes The Breadwinner, Mud City and My Name Is Parvana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A war is raging in Afghanistan as a coalition of Western forces tries to oust the Taliban by bombing the country. Parvana&amp;#8217;s father has died, and her mother, sister and brother have gone to a faraway wedding, not knowing what has happened to the father. Parvana doesn&amp;#8217;t know where they are. She just knows she has to find them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She sets out alone, masquerading as a boy, her journey becoming more perilous as the bombs begin to fall. Making her way across the desolate Afghan countryside, she meets other children who are strays from the war &amp;#8212; an infant boy in a bombed-out village, a nine-year-old girl who believes she has magical powers over land mines, and a boy with one leg who is so obnoxious that Parvana can hardly stand him. The children travel together because it is easier than being alone. And, as they forge their own family in the war zone that Afghanistan has become, their resilience, imagination and luck help them to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reissue includes a new cover and map, an updated author&amp;#8217;s note and a glossary to provide young readers with background and context. All royalties from the sale of this book will go to Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan. Parvana&amp;#8217;s Fund supports education projects for Afghan women and children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
