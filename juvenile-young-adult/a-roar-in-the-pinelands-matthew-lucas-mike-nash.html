  <title>A Roar in the Pinelands - Matthew Lucas, Mike Nash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Something evil is lurking in the Pinelands. The lakes and springs are drying up, and scores of animals are falling ill from a mysterious disease. Roused by the growing alarm, LeRoy Thadeusthe alligator judge of all the swamp and streamsand an unlikely band of compatriots leave the safety of their homes and dens to investigate.
It is a perilous journey for Judge LeRoy, his raccoon bailiff Bullbore, Javier Ortiz the marsh rabbit, Bobby Lee the bobcat, and an osprey messenger called Screech, as they travel along forgotten paths through wildfires and strange countries to reach the fabled headwaters of the Pinelands. The echoes of an ancient war can be heard once more when the animals discover a threat that is determined to settle an old score. Danger lies around every turn, and the lives of free animals everywhere hang in the balance as Judge LeRoy and his companions unite to save their world from destruction.
An engrossing world stocked with vivid characters  and an often frightening realism  with an environmentalist bite.
