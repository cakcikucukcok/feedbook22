  <title>Amazing Adventures in Shelby&#39;s Shoes - Melissa Harker Ridenour, Veronica Castle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Amazing Adventures in Shelby&amp;rsquo;s Shoes is a sweet and funny story that offers a valuable life lesson to any child: Believe in yourself; you can be anything you want to be. As Shelby instantly transforms herself by changing her shoes, children feel it&amp;rsquo;s okay to &amp;lsquo;try on&amp;rsquo; different interests and activities to see what is the &amp;lsquo;best fit&amp;rsquo; for them. Shelby&amp;rsquo;s Shoes also sends the message to parents that allowing our children to pursue a variety of interests gives them the freedom and autonomy to make their own empowered choices, and thrive once they find the &amp;lsquo;perfect fit&amp;rsquo;. Shelby and her adventures are delightfully brought to life through the fun, unique, and engaging artwork of illustrator, Veronica Castle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Kids will enjoy sharing Shelby&amp;rsquo;s adventure as she tries on different personas and, like Shelby, realize in the end that they can do anything (they want to do) and be anyone (they want to be) if they really try&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br /&gt;
(Sandra McLeod Humphrey, Retired Clinical Psychologist and Award-Winning Children&amp;#39;s Author / Character Education Consultant at Kids Can Do It, LLC / Blog &amp;ndash; Character Books for Kids)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;In Amazing Adventures in Shelby&amp;rsquo;s Shoes, the author has created a delightful combination of fun rhyme and great imagination. The story teaches children that no matter where their inspirations may take them, there is always that possibility of dreams coming true, especially if the desire for them to happen is strong enough. This is a story children of all ages will enjoy!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
