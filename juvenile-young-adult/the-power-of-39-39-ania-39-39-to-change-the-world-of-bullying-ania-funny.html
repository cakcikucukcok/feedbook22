      <meta name="description" content="Main Characters:
1.	Ania: Hero 
2.	Kathy: Bully #1
3.	Steve: Bully #2
4.	Ms. Denise: Teacher and Mother of Bullies
5.	Tyrone, Jessica, Tom and Beth: Imaginary Bullies
6.	Christopher: New Student
Christopher is the new student at school. Ania was the first person to meet Christopher and told everyone that he is nice. Christopher encountered the bullies during lunch. Before the end of the day, Bully #1 tried to take Christophers lunch money and Bully #2 took his bus tickets.  Ania stopped Bully #1 from taking his lunch money, However she was not around when Bully #2 took his bus tickets. Ania was brave enough to approach the two bullies about taking things from the new student.
Ania immediately reported the bullies to the Teacher after her failed attempt to get the stolen items from the bullies. The Teacher was also the mother of the two bullies. The Teacher did not believe that her children would do such a thing.  
Ania had magical powers that no one knew about. She took matters into her hand and casted a spell on Kathy. She zapped Kathy to Bully Elementary School, so that she could see what her future would look like if she continued to be a bully. Kathy met three of the meanest bullies at the school. She was bullied and ended up with a black eye. Kathy felt really bad and wanted to make thing right with the new student at her school.
 After Kathy returned to school, she told Bully #2 that Ania have magical powers. Bully #2 didnt believe her. She made him go with her to tell their Ms. Denise (Teacher/Mom) the truth. Their Mom placed them on suspension at school and punishment at home. They eventually apologized to Christopher and promised to give his money and bus ticket back. From this day on, they never bullied anyone.
 After high school, they all went to college and their lives were forever changed. The Imaginary Bullies joined the United States Navy. Bully #1 became a Judge. Bully #2 became a CNN News Reporter.  Ms. Denise retired after 40 years of teaching. Christopher became a Congressman and later a running mate for Vice President of the United States of America. Ania graduated from Princeton University, became a lawyer and partner, and finally became the first African American female President of the United States of America.
They all continued their friendship and planned reunions all over the world." />
