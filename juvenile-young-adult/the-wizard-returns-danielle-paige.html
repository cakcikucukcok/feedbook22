  <title>The Wizard Returns - Danielle Paige</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Wizard left Oz in a hot air balloon&amp;#8212;or did he? This digital original novella is the third installment in the prequel arc to the edgy and exciting New York Times bestseller &lt;em&gt;Dorothy Must Die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorothy Gale is back . . . and she&#39;s not the sweet little heroine of Oz anymore. She&#39;s power-hungry and vicious, and she leaves a trail of destruction beneath her spike-heeled, magical shoes. But she wasn&#39;t always in charge. There used to be a different ruler of Oz. Someone who also came from the Other Place, and who stole power for himself. They called him the Wizard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story goes that when a young Dorothy revealed the Wizard as a fraud, the man behind the curtain fled Oz in his hot air balloon. But in &lt;em&gt;The Wizard Returns&lt;/em&gt;, he wakes in a field of poppies to find out that not only had he never left, but that he has no memory of who&amp;#8212;or where&amp;#8212;he is. As he undergoes a series of tests to uncover his memories, he finds that the very girl who threw him from the Emerald Palace is in control. And that Oz may be his destiny after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wizard Returns&lt;/em&gt; by Danielle Paige is a dark and compelling reimagining of a beloved classic and is perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Cinder&lt;/em&gt; by Marissa Meyer, &lt;em&gt;Beastly&lt;/em&gt; by Alex Flinn, and &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; by Gregory Maguire.&lt;/p&gt;" />
