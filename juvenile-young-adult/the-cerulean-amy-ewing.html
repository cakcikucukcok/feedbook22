She is curious about everything&amp;#8212;especially the planet that her City is magically tethered to&amp;#8212;and can&amp;#8217;t stop questioning things. Sera has always longed for the day when the tether will finally break and the Cerulean can move to a new planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Sera is chosen as the sacrifice to break the tether, she feels betrayed by everything in which she&amp;#8217;d been taught to trust.
