  <title>Yogi: Wuss of the Jungle - Mary DiMaggio, Raymond Reyes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yogi, a privileged Tibetan Terrier, tells the story about his screwball family who moved him from his beautiful home in California to a fixer-upper on a beach in Costa Rica- a beach with mean, skinny dogs who didnt even speak his language and where his Blue Ribbons didnt mean a thing!
	The new lifestyle appeals to everyone but him. Dad thinks he is fifteen again and has gone back to surfing, Mom is cooking weird foods like gallo pinto, TJ and Gina are enchanted by their new and diverse school friends, and even Nana  has ditched him and taken up salsa dancing. Yogi flops around in the heat feeling sorry for himself until one night, terrified by a lightning storm, he runs into the jungle to hide and discovers himself lost. He will become changed forever by the creatures he meets who teach him simple lessons about life as they help him find his way home. From his new friends he learns the value of tolerance, respect for another culture, and appreciation for family.. and even a little Spanish." />
