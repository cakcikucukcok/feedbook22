  <title>THE TALE OF GALAZI THE WOLF - a Zulu Legend - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 457&lt;br /&gt;
In this 457th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Zulu Legend &amp;quot;The Tale of Galazi the Wolf&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE, UPON A TIME, a long, long time ago and far, far away, in KwaZulu &amp;ndash; which means the Home of the Zulu, there lived a man names Umslopogass, which is pronounced just like it is written - Oom-slop-oh-ghass.&lt;br /&gt;
This tale tells of when Umslopogass was taken by a lion, which bounded away with Umslopogass in her mouth. He feigned death to outwit the lion and presently the world grew dark and he slipped into unconsciousness.&lt;br /&gt;
A good while later he was surprised to wake up and felt pain in his thigh. There was a lot of shouting and he saw the lioness snorting with rage, ready to spring.&lt;br /&gt;
In front of her was a lad long and strong, with a grim face, and a wolf&amp;rsquo;s hide, black and grey, bound about his shoulders in such fashion that the upper jar and teeth of the wolf rested on his head. He stood before the lioness, shouting, and in one hand he held a large war-shield, and in the other he grasped a heavy club shod with iron.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Did the lion attack and what happened to the young lad? Did he kill the lion or did the lion kill him? And what, or who, is the Watcher of the Ford? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE BABA INDABA STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
