  <title>Operation Prom Date - Cindi Madsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kate ships tons of fictional couples, but IRL her OTP is her and Mick, the hot quarterback she&#39;s crushed on since, like, forever. With only one semester left of senior year, it&#39;s now or never if she wants to land him in time for prom. Since she&#39;s flirtationally challenged, she enlists Cooper Callihan, the guy who turned popular seemingly overnight but who used to be a good friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cooper lives and breathes rowing, but his partner just broke his wrist. When he remembers Kate&#39;s good with a set of oars, he strikes a deal: help him train, and he&#39;ll make sure her crush notices her. Only he didn&#39;t know how addicting spending time with her would be. Or how the more successful the Operation is, the more jealousy he experiences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mission has been set. The troops have their marching orders. But what if the target is the wrong guy all along?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains stargazing, accidental swimming, and poker swindling. This kissing practice will melt your ereader...and give you a new couple to ship.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
