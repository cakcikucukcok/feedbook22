  <title>THE WISE JACKAL - A Fairy Tale from India - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 460&lt;br /&gt;
In this 460th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates an Indian fairy tale - &amp;quot;The Wise Jackal&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE, UPON A TIME, a long, long time ago and far, far away in India lived two princesses whose father, the Rajah, was always busy with affairs of state to look after them. They were lonely and neglected, for they had a stepmother who treated them very cruelly. They lived in a beautiful palace, but nothing was done to make them happy or contented, for even the servants were afraid of the Rajah&amp;#39;s second wife.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I am going to run away,&amp;quot; said the elder princess to her sister. &amp;quot;Will you go with me, Dehra!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Where can we go?&amp;quot; replied Dehra.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;There are a great many places where we can go,&amp;quot; said Nala, &amp;quot;but first we will go into the jungle. We will make a little house of tree branches and have beds of grass and flowers and there will be plenty of fruit to eat.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Did the Princesses find somewhere safe to stay? Did they stay together or did happenstance separate them? Who did they meet and what dangers did they face? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
