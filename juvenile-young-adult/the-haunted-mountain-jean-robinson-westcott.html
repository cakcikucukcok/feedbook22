  <title>The Haunted Mountain - Jean Robinson Westcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twelve year-old Rad Sergeant and his little brother Tyler live with their dad on his horse ranch. They are living every boy&#39;s fantasy until a rumor of a ghost living in the mountain behind their ranch is reported. Rad intends to find out if the ghost is real and enlists the help of his two best friends, Max Frost and Peter Logan, to help investigate. Before the story ends, the boys survive a tornado, Rad falls into a pit that nearly takes his life and they come face to face with the ghost.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The characters of Mountain Valley are real kids dealing with every day problems who need fantasy occasionally. These kids know the simpler way of life, the enjoyment of church, helping friends and neighbors, and keeping their body&#39;s drug-free. Mountain Valley kids are dynamic characters that demonstrate real living, not the kind that carries one away on a broomstick.&lt;/P&gt;" />
