  <title>The Emerald Casket - Richard Newsome, Jonny Duddle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It has only been a month since Gerald Wilkins be-came the richest kid on earth. One month since he found out his great-aunt Geraldine had left him all her fortune and, with it, a murder mystery, clues to a diamond heist, and a target on his back. One month since Sir Mason Green made off with the contents of the diamond casket, an object of unspeakable power. And you thought your school vacation was eventful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As book two of the Archer Legacy opens, Gerald, Ruby, and Sam come upon papers, drawings, and reams of research, all indicating that Gerald&#39;s family has been protecting a secret concerning nothing less than the fate of the world. Now Gerald and his friends are off to India to try to find out the truth. Friendships will be forged and broken. A city buried under the sea will be rediscovered. A whole mess of pigeons will be involved. And Gerald is going to have to make a choice between his love for his friends and the darkest desires of his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s entirely possible that this month might be even more eventful than the last.&lt;/p&gt;" />
