      <meta name="description" content="Joanne, Russel, Jade, and Jake are just the typical miners you would expect on a mining expedition, but not this mission. The four miners goals are to go to Peru to discover the rare ruby diamond, a gem discovered in ancient times by mountain men and has never been found since. When the foursome reaches Peru, they find the unusual mine. And then . . . 
All of a sudden, the wind started howling. The trees started shaking. It was as if the clouds were yelling rain out of their system. The sky was gray. There was lightning shooting across the sky. The thunder was pounding against our ears. 
Its a storm, Jake said. 
Thank you, Mr. Obvious! Jade sneered. 
Suddenly, we saw a boulder fall from the caves ceiling. Not before long, boulders started piling up in front of us, which was the entrance. 
Whats happening! Joanne yelled over the voice of nature. 
Its an avalanche! I yelled. Run out of the cave! Quickly! 
But we were too late. The boulders stacked up on us, and we were trapped." />
