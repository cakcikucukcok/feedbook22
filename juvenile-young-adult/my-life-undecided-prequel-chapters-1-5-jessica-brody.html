  <title>My Life Undecided: Prequel &amp; Chapters 1-5 - Jessica Brody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Download the exclusive eBook prequel and first five chapters of &lt;i&gt;My Life Undecided&lt;/i&gt; by Jessica Brody. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLEASE READ THIS! MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe that was a bit melodramatic, but I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m feeling a bit melodramatic at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the deal. My name is Brooklyn Pierce, I&#39;m fifteen years old, and I am decisionally challenged. Seriously, I can&#39;t remember the last &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; decision I made. I can remember &lt;i&gt;plenty&lt;/i&gt; of crappy ones though. Including that party I threw when my parents were out of town that &lt;i&gt;accidentally&lt;/i&gt; burned down a model home. Yeah, not my finest moment, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But see, that&#39;s why I started a blog. To enlist readers to make my decisions for me. That&#39;s right. I gave up. Threw in the towel. I let someone else decide which book I read for English. And whether or not I accepted an invitation to join the debate team from that cute-in-a-dorky-sort-of-way guy who gave me the Heimlich maneuver in the cafeteria. (Note to self: chew the melon before swallowing it.) I even let them decide who I dated!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out there are some things in life you simply can&#39;t choose or have chosen for you--like who you fall in love with. And now everything&#39;s more screwed up than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don&#39;t take my word for it. Read the book and decide for yourself. You&#39;ll laugh, you&#39;ll cry, you&#39;ll scream in frustration. Or maybe that&#39;s just me. After all, it&#39;s my life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
