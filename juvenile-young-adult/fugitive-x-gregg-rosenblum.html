  <title>Fugitive X - Gregg Rosenblum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the creators of &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;American Horror Story&lt;/em&gt; comes &lt;em&gt;Fugitive X&lt;/em&gt;, the chilling sequel to &lt;em&gt;Revolution 19&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the robot revolution, anyone who escaped capture by the bots made their homes in secret freeposts in the wilderness outside the bot-controlled Cities. Siblings Nick, Kevin, and Cass never would have dreamed of venturing into the Cities, but when their parents are kidnapped, they have no choice but to follow them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everything goes as planned, though, and the siblings find themselves fleeing the city without their parents. And then the three are separated, and for the first time, they are on their own. Cass is brought in for reprogramming by the bots; Nick joins up with rebel soldiers; and Kevin meets the man who is responsible for the robot technology&amp;#8212;and their only chance at defeating the robots once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the three fight to take down the bots, they must prepare for a looming war between bots and humans that will decide the fate of the human world forever.  &lt;/p&gt;" />
