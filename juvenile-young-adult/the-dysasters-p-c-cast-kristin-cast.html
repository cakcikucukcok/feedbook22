  <title>The Dysasters - P. C. Cast, Kristin Cast</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P.C. and Kristin Cast, the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling authors of the House of Night phenomenon, return to the scene with &lt;i&gt;The Dysasters&lt;/i&gt;--the first action-packed novel in a new paranormal fantasy series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoptive daughter of a gifted scientist, Foster Stewart doesn&#39;t live a &quot;normal&quot; life, (not that she&#39;d want to). But controlling cloud formations and seeing airwaves aren&#39;t things most eighteen year olds can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small town star quarterback and quintessential dreamy boy next door, Tate &quot;Nighthawk&quot; Taylor has never thought much about his extra abilities. Sure, his night vision comes in handy during games, but who wouldn&#39;t want that extra edge? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment Foster and Tate collide, their worlds spiral and a deadly tornado forces them to work together, fully awakening their not-so-natural ability - the power to control air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they each deal with the tragic loss of loved ones, they&#39;re caught by another devastating blow - they are the first in a group of teens genetically manipulated before birth to bond with the elements, and worse... they&#39;re being hunted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Foster and Tate must fight to control their abilities as they learn of their past, how they came to be, who&#39;s following them, and what tomorrow will bring... more DYSASTERS?&lt;/p&gt;" />
