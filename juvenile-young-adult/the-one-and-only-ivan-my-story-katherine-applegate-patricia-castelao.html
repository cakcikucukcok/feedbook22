  <title>The One and Only Ivan: My Story - Katherine Applegate, Patricia Castelao</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soon to be a major motion picture!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the Newbery Medal and a #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This&amp;#160;unforgettable novel from renowned author Katherine Applegate celebrates the transformative power of unexpected friendship. Inspired by the true story of a captive gorilla known as Ivan, this illustrated book is told from the point of view of Ivan himself.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This acclaimed middle grade novel is an excellent choice for tween readers in grades 5 to 6, especially during homeschooling. It&amp;#8217;s a fun way to keep your child entertained and engaged while not in the classroom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having spent 27 years behind the glass walls of his enclosure in a shopping mall, Ivan has grown accustomed to humans watching him. He hardly ever thinks about his life in the jungle. Instead, Ivan occupies himself with television, his friends Stella and Bob, and painting. But when he meets Ruby, a baby elephant taken from the wild, he is forced to see their home, and his art, through new eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The One and Only Ivan&lt;/em&gt; was hailed as a best book of the year by &lt;em&gt;Kirkus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;, and Amazon, demonstrating it is a true classic in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of timeless stories like &lt;em&gt;Charlotte&#39;s Web&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stuart Little&lt;/em&gt;, Katherine Applegate blends humor and poignancy to create Ivan&#39;s unforgettable first-person narration in a story of friendship, art, and hope. An author&#39;s note depicts the differences between the fictional story and true events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus don&#39;t miss&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The One and Only Bob,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;Katherine Applegate&#39;s return to the world of Ivan, Bob, and Ruby!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
