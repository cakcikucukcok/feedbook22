  <title>The Lonely Puppy - Maxine Lowry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Toby is a Labrador puppy that has been left home for the day while his friend William goes to the city. With no one to play with, he discovers the gate has been left open and goes out onto the farm. He comes across a variety of creatures, none of whom wants to play, and then finds a dam full of water. In his rush for a drink, he jumps in and has an unexpected surprise. 
Now exhausted, he falls asleep and wakes in the dark, feeling very hungry. He realizes he is lost and howls for his friend to find him, but a one-eyed monster has heard him and is now chasing him. 
Will Toby be found in time? Will he get home safely?" />
