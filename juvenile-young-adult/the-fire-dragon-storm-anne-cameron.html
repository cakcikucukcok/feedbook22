      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the fast-paced conclusion to The Lightning Catcher quartet, storm prophet Angus McFangus makes one final attempt to rescue his parents and save his school from the villainous Scabious Dankhart. This school adventure series is a mix of &lt;em&gt;Storm Chasers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Mysterious Benedict Society. &lt;/em&gt;Action-packed, lighthearted, and perfect for reluctant readers, with black-and-white illustrations by Newbery Honor author Victoria Jamieson!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halfway through their second year at the Perilous Exploratorium for Violent Weather and Vicious Storms, Angus McFangus and his two best friends, Indigo Midnight and Dougal Dewsnap, are being heatedly pursued by Scabious Dankhart. In an attempt to foil Dankhart, who is already holding Angus&amp;#8217;s parents as prisoners, Angus and his friends fake their own deaths and go into hiding within the Exploratorium itself. When they discover the existence of blue-dragon scales that allow a storm prophet to control multiple fire dragons at once, the trio goes on a quest to locate all four scales. As the single living storm prophet, Angus is the only person who can control the dragon scales and use them to defeat Dankhart and his powerful lightning tower.&lt;/p&gt;" />
