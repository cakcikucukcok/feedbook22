  <title>A Service Dog Life - Kimberly Kiely</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will become a valuable tool for parents, teachers, and educators for the future development of the ADA culture. Educational materials do not provide necessary information to educate people, especially young children, the importance and great abilities service animals provide their handlers.
New vocabulary is introduced, and dog commands are typed in capital letters to guide the reader in the necessity of one-word commands for a service animal.
I wrote this book based on the fact that after becoming permanently disabled, I needed a service dog. I was trying to find books to introduce the idea to my family and especially my young son. There were not a lot of books available to explain the situation of bringing a service dog into a home to help with disabilities. I further became aware that there were even less materials available that mentioned any aid beyond using a wheelchair or being blind. Where were the books to explain to people and their children the need for service animals for people that can be visually and not visually seen as having a disability?
Therefore, it led me to believe that I should write a book that shows that there are many needs for service dogs and service animals for many different people. Service dogs and service animals serve a great purpose to many individuals for many different reasons." />
