  <title>The Last Chore - David L Dahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The sun hung low in the cloudless blue sky. Itchy&#39;s ears twitched as he nervously stomped his feet and sniffed the air.  &quot;Easy boy, I smell it.&quot; Livy stroked her horse&#39;s neck and stared at the ridge to the east. The wind carried the strong smell of smoke and she strained to locate the source. Olivia spent the summer working the Bar S Ranch. Her flight home is just three days away, when Pa Atkinson sends her on a last chore. Eager for a chance to make the trip she sets out at daybreak.  &quot;Keep an eye on the skyline for smoke. If you smell smoke, or hear the choppers, turn around. I can get the radio after you head home. Use your head, and keep your senses about you.&quot; Don warns as she leaves.  Unfortunately, the fast moving fire traps Olivia on the Butte.  Olivia is in a race for her life. Along the way she finds the key to saving the ranch, but can she use it?    &quot;Won&#39;t do any good if I can&#39;t get away from this fire.&quot;" />
