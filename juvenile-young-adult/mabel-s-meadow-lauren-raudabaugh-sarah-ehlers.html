  <title>Mabel’S Meadow - Lauren Raudabaugh, Sarah Ehlers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mabel cant believe it when one day she looks into a puddle and sees her reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had always imagined she was a bright, beautiful caterpillar, but she realizes with horror that shes skinny, green, and plain looking. Her bright, cheerful smile turns into a frown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then a red-bellied robin flies out of the sky to talk to Mabel. Oh dont worry, little Mabel! Im not going to eat you! the robin says. My name is Eloise, and I have been watching you from afar. What seems to be the problem here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Eloise hears what it is, she tells Mabel that beauty isnt determined by whats on the outside, but by whats on the inside. She advises Mabel to continue being a kind caterpillar and sharing her beauty with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mabelwho had always had a loving heartfollows Eloises advice by striving even harder to help her friends in the meadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Mabel as she learns the true definition of beauty and discovers that friendship and kindness can change the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
