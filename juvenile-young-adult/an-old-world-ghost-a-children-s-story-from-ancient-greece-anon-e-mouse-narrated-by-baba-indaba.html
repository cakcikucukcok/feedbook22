  <title>AN OLD WORLD GHOST - A Children’s Story from Ancient Greece - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 202&lt;br /&gt;
In this 202nd issue of the Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories series, Baba Indaba narrates the ancient Greek tale of &amp;ldquo;THE OLD-WORLD GHOST.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
In about the year 50AD, Pliny told this story. Pliny was an author, naturalist, and philosopher, as well as naval and army commander of the early Roman Empire, and personal friend of the emperor Vespasian. So his words should be closely listened to&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
He tells the story of a house in old Athens which stood empty for many years. Some said they had heard sounds emanating from the house at night, sounds of chains clinking. Others said they had seen &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; in the house and occupants of the house never stayed long. Upon investigation during daylight hours, nothing was ever found.&lt;br /&gt;
One man, Athenodorus, decided to be brave and investigate. He decided that if there was a Ghost, he would confront it in an attempt to put the restless spectre to rest and get rid of it once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;
But exactly what happened, did Athenodorus survive? More importantly was he brave enough to face the clinking and clanking of the ghost in the middle of the night? You&amp;rsquo;re invited to download and read the story of Athenodorus and the Old-World Ghost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
33% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
