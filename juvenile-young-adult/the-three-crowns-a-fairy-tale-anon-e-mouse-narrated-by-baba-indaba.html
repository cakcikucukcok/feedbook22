  <title>THE THREE CROWNS - A Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 403&lt;br /&gt;
In this 403rd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE THREE CROWNS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was once a king who had three daughters. The two eldest were very proud and quarrelsome, but the youngest was as good as they were bad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three princes came to court them, and two of them were exactly like the eldest ladies, and one was just as lovable as the youngest.&lt;br /&gt;
One day they were all walking down to a lake that lay at the bottom of the lawn when they met a poor beggar. The king wouldn&amp;#39;t give him anything, and the eldest princesses wouldn&amp;#39;t give him anything, nor their sweethearts; but the youngest daughter and her true love did give him something, and kind words along with it, and that was better than all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened. There were some strange, some silly and some serious occurrences. But exactly what were they? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
