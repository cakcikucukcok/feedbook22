  <title>How Long Is Forever? - Susan Mccartney, Mary O&#39;neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever had one of those nagging questions that just doesnt have one of those one-size-fits-all answers? Ben, an intelligent elementary-aged child, wants to know the complete meaning of words that are often hard to understand and even harder to explain. As he talks with the different adults in his life, he begins to realize that the word forever has many meanings, which seems to somehow depend on each persons point of view. As he goes from adult to adult, he becomes frustrated when no one has the answer he is looking for. Finally, he turns to the minister of his church, and after some soul searching, the minister finally gives Ben an answer that explains the word forever in a way that helps Ben fully comprehend the meaning." />
