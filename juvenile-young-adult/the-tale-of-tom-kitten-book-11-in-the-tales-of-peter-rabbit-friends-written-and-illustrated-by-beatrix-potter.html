  <title>THE TALE OF TOM KITTEN - Book 11 in the Tales of Peter Rabbit &amp; Friends - Written and Illustrated By Beatrix Potter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tale of Tom Kitten&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a tale about teasing, featuring a kitten and a mouse, that was written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter and is book 11 in the Tales of Peter Rabbit &amp;amp; Friends series.&lt;br /&gt;
The tale is about manners and how children react to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tabitha Twitchit, the cat, invites friends for tea. In order to prepare, she washes and dresses her three kittens for the party, but unwisely let them play in the garden while she gets on with the preparations. Within moments the kittens have soiled and lost their clothes while scampering about the garden. The Puddle-Duck family, Mr Drake, Jemima and Rebeccah, pick up the clothes and put them on. Then waddle off to the pond to swim. Tabitha comes out to call the children in and is &amp;quot;affronted&amp;quot; by what she finds. She sends the kittens to bed, and tells her friends the kittens have the measles. Once the tea party is underway however, its &amp;quot;dignity and repose&amp;quot; are disturbed by the kittens romping overhead and leaving a bedroom in disorder. How did the Puddle-Duck family fare swimming in clothes? Well you&amp;rsquo;ll just have download and read this story to find out.&lt;br /&gt;
