  <title>Four Empowering and Positive Adventures for Children - Lynne Rowlands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;These four adventures allow children to be gently reminded of how to connect, in a loving manner, to their angels; to empower themselves using crystals safely; to experiment with a beautiful and simple light filled Golden Orb meditation and so much more. The stories allow imaginations to soar  starting with the empowering How to be a Peaceful Warrior which applies to both girls and boys. Its OK to Know and Care about your Guardian Angel gives support to many young children who feel or sense energy around them but find it hard to put into words. Melly the Mermaid is an uplifting and sometimes funny tale of why we need to look after our oceans involving Ami, Jade and a confused 7 year old called Jack. For those children who are very sensitive to the stars in the heavens, Athenas Decision may give them further insights into the Cosmos.&lt;/P&gt;" />
