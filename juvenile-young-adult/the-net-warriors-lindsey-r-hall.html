  <title>The Net Warriors - Lindsey R. Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Nic Granger didn&#39;t plan to save the world.  He just wanted to play The Three Kings of Orr online and defeat the Deceiver.  The Deceiver had other ideas.  As the land of Orr&#39;s nastiest villain, he had escaped into the real world some weeks before when the man who invented inter reality chips actually made one work.  
&lt;P&gt;
When Nic finds himself in Orr, an amazing journey begins through time, space, the Internet and the world of his own street.   With the help his best friend Frog, younger sister Emily, the knight Riddith and Princess Rhea, The Net Warriors are born.  They are joined by a host of other characters including Bruce, a dragon with appallingly smelly breath and Prefix, a mace with the character of a playful puppy. As for the hackers, who is black hat and who is white?
&lt;P&gt;
Follow their adventures to the End of Time as they are captured by the Hellriders, battle with the headless horsemen, and try to find the Deceiver before he finds them. Can they put the worlds of reality and inter-reality back to how they should be?  
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;A review by Suzanne Coleburn, Reader To Reader Reviews&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
If you are a lover of virtual reality games you are going to love THE NET 
WARRIORS.  This enticing story begins when a Japanese man who designed Dec 
chips for digital entertainment and home control centers with the latest 
computer technology in the beginning of the 21st Century changed things in 
the world one day when he decided to change things with his game &quot;The Three 
Kings of Orr.&quot;  The game was complex, net based and linked to a web ring, 
rather than DVD or disc based and what happens next is wild and wooly. 
Katana assumed the part of the Wise King and while in the game he activated 
his mortal enemy, the Deceiver who was a shrewd and unsavory character who 
could change into human and animals at will.  Before he knows it Katana is 
dissolved into the game and disappears.
&lt;P&gt;
The special IR chip that Kantana designed was installed in a DEC set and 
sent to the Granger family in a small country town in England where a young 
14 year old boy named Nic who has a copy of &quot;The Three Kings of Orr&quot; 
receives a special message of help on his monitor screen.  Nic assumes the 
persona of the Wise King of Orr and types the words in the message and finds 
himself blending into the screen and into the game.  What a blast. This fast 
paced story rockets into the fantasy world of Orr and into the reality of 
life in England, America and Australia as the good guys and the baddies come 
together trying to save the world from the Deceiver.
&lt;P&gt;
Lindsey Hall does a bang up job of keeping his readers glued to the screen 
finding out what is going to happen next.  A jolly good story.  Don&#39;t miss 
it!
