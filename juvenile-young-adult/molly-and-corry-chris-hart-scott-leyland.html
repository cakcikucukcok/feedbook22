  <title>Molly and Corry - Chris Hart, Scott Leyland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Molly is an eleven year old girl whose best friend is a fully functioning A.I. computer called Corry. In their second great adventure they&amp;#39;re on a mission to rescue a lost pet and as she finds out more Molly becomes convinced a crime has been committed. She even thinks she knows who did it. Corry gains the ability to see and creates a whole new set of problems for Molly. Dad proves he&amp;#39;s a hero, risking life and limb and somehow, so does Molly&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;brother Tom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duo become sleuths to investigate and bring the culprit to justice. They recruit a wannabe spy, a retired spy and a spy in the sky, to catch a creepy spy guy and liberate a couple of dozen hostages on the way, while trying to get an &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; in science with Lizzie and definitely not looking cool in pink. Corry discovers she&amp;rsquo;s not alone and like most families&amp;nbsp; they have thier own problems, but usually ours&amp;nbsp;can be fixed without space flight. At school Riley&amp;#39;s still a pain and it looks like Jazzy the class bully has&amp;nbsp;been arrested, but looks can be deceiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly and Corry conquer the perils of space and dare a rescue in an adventure requiring detective skills, bravery, a brush with death and the help of a local dragon Lord (retired)... and of course, dad.&lt;/p&gt;" />
