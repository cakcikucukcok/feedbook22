  <title>THE ENCHANTED CASTLE - 15 Illustrated Children&#39;s Stories - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein you will find 13 illustrated children&amp;rsquo;s stories, each linked to a specific flower. But why flowers? Firstly, because flowers brighten up our lives, and those who read this book will be interested in the beautiful stories they have to tell, loving them even more when they know something of their past history and some of the events with which they are associated. The forty illustrations will also help young ones visualise the environment in which they are set.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The enchanted castle&lt;br /&gt;
The fair maids of february&lt;br /&gt;
The loveless youth&lt;br /&gt;
The wind flower&lt;br /&gt;
The fate of hyacinthus&lt;br /&gt;
St. leonard and the fiery snake&lt;br /&gt;
A fair prisoner&lt;br /&gt;
The ungrateful traveler&lt;br /&gt;
The star of bethlehem&lt;br /&gt;
The angel&amp;#39;s gift&lt;br /&gt;
The holy hay&lt;br /&gt;
The search for gold&lt;br /&gt;
The flower fairies&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One very old writer tells us that he knew of forty-six flowers by which he could tell the time, and since then a great many more have been discovered. These time-keepers open and shut their blossoms at exactly the same time each day, and every hour of the day or night some flower opens and closes its petals.&lt;br /&gt;
And those who love fairies know that they have much to do with the flowers, and while to some they may seem very trifling occupations&amp;mdash;this writing and reading about fairies&amp;mdash;yet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Another sort there be, that will&lt;br /&gt;
Be talking of the Fairies still;&lt;br /&gt;
Nor never can they have their fill&lt;br /&gt;
As they were wedded to them.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
