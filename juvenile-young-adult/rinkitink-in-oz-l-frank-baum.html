Rinkitink, a plump jolly fellow, and his grouchy goat Bilbil assist Inga, the crown prince of Pingaree, in reclaiming his lost kingdom from invaders. Inga is helped in his efforts by three magic pearls: one, blue, giving him superhuman strength; one, pink, protecting him from harm; and one, white, providing him with words of wisdom. But when the pearls are lost, can Queen Ozma, watching events on her magic mirror, save the day? Thrilling tale of adventure from a master storyteller, „Rinkitink in Oz” is sure to enjoyed by Oz fans far and wide and by all who delight in tales of enchantment and adventure." />
