  <title>Quasar and the Eye of the Serpent - T. K. Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is a dark day in the forest when teenagers Mathew and Sue Robert discover unfamiliar surroundings while playing in the woodlands where they live with their father. As they spot a bright light they move towards it, hoping it would help guide them. But fear washes over them when they meet a stranger in the woods. The man said the teens were expected, according to an ancient text. Although alarmed they follow him deeper into the forest, where they are introduced to a great wolf named Quasar.&lt;p&gt; 
Quasar asks Mathew and Sue to find six magical objects, which will remove an evil spell placed upon him by the witch Xaviera. As they journey over this magical land, Mathew and Sue must answer riddles and solve puzzles in order to find the next object. Can they complete all six steps within twenty-four hours? Who can they trust on their quest to help Quasar?&lt;p&gt; 
Travel along with Mathew and Sue in this special forest, experience magic and magical creatures: dragons, unicorns, centaurs, dwarfs, elves, and fairies, and help save Quasar and the Eye of the Serpent." />
