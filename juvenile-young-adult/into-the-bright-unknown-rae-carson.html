  <title>Into the Bright Unknown - Rae Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The stunning conclusion to Rae Carson&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8211;bestselling Gold Seer trilogy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leah Westfall&amp;#8217;s journey has been one of ever-present peril, hidden magic, harsh realities, loss, life, determination, and love. She has searched for a place to belong and a place to call home, and people who can accept a girl with magical powers that prove to be both blessing and curse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rae Carson has been lauded as one of YA&amp;#8217;s best writers of fantasy, and fans of Leigh Bardugo, Sarah J. Maas, and &lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt; will be riveted by the conclusion of this remarkable historical fantasy trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leah is poised to have everything she ever dreamed of on the long, dangerous journey to California&amp;#8217;s gold fields&amp;#8212;wealth, love, the truest friends, and a home. Thanks to her magical ability to sense precious gold, Leah, her fianc&amp;#233; Jefferson, and her friends have claimed rich land in California Territory. But their fortune makes them a target, and when a dangerous billionaire sets out to destroy them, Leah and her friends must fight back with all of their power and talents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leah&amp;#8217;s magic is continuing to strengthen and grow, but someone is on to her&amp;#8212;someone who might have a bit of magic herself. The stakes are higher than ever as Lee and her friends hatch a daring scheme that could alter California&amp;#8217;s history forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a distinctive heroine and a unique interpretation of American history, &lt;em&gt;Into the Bright Unknown&lt;/em&gt; strikes a rich vein of romance, magic, and adventure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
