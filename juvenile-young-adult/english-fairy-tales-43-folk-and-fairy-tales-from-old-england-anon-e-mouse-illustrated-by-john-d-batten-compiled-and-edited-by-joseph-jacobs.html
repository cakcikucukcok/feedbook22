  <title>ENGLISH FAIRY TALES - 43 folk and fairy tales from old England - Anon E. Mouse, Illustrated by John D. Batten, Compiled and Edited by Joseph Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume contains 43 English folk and fairy tales. Stories like&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Tom Tit Tot&amp;rdquo;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The Three Sillies&amp;rdquo;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The Rose Tree&amp;rdquo;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The Old Woman and Her Pig&amp;rdquo;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How Jack Went to Seek His Fortune&amp;rdquo;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mr. Vinegar&amp;rdquo;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nix Nought Nothing&amp;rdquo; and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many of the tales in this volume, as in similar collections from other European countries, are what the folklorists call Drolls, or a short comical sketch. They serve to justify the title of &amp;ldquo;Merrie England&amp;rdquo; and mostly originate from the puritan era (1649 &amp;ndash; 1660), a title which used to be given to England, indicating the unsuspected capacity for fun and humour among the English. The story of &lt;i&gt;Tom Tit&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Tot, &lt;/i&gt;which opens the collection, is unequalled among all other folk-tales, for its combined sense of humour and dramatic power.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But why call them FAIRY STORIES? One cannot imagine a child saying, &amp;#39;Tell me a folk-tale&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;Another nursery tale, please, grandma&amp;#39;.&amp;nbsp; The words &amp;#39;Fairy Tales&amp;#39; must accordingly be taken to include tales in which occurs something &amp;#39;fairy&amp;#39;, something extraordinary--fairies, giants, dwarfs, speaking animals. It must be taken also to cover tales in which what is extraordinary is the stupidity of some of the actors, as is so common in moral tales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So take some time out and travel back to a period before television, or even radio for that matter, when families would gather around a crackling and spitting hearth and granddad or grandma, or an uncle or aunt, would delight and captivate their audience with stories passed on to them from their mothers, fathers and grandparents before them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net income from the sale of this book will be donated to Charities.&lt;br /&gt;
