  <title>The Fall of Butterflies - Andrea Portes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Were Liars&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Looking for Alaska&lt;/em&gt; in a uniquely funny and heartbreaking teen novel about a passionate-yet-doomed friendship set against a backdrop of wealth and glamour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willa Parker, 646th and least-popular resident of What Cheer, Iowa, is headed east to start a new life. Did she choose this life? No, because that would be too easy&amp;#8212;and nothing in Willa&amp;#8217;s life is easy. It&amp;#8217;s her famous genius mother&amp;#8217;s idea to send her to ultra-expensive, ultra-exclusive Pembroke Prep, and Willa has no intention of fitting in. But when she meets peculiar, glittering Remy Taft, the richest, most mysterious girl on campus, she starts to see a foothold in this foreign world&amp;#8212;a place where she could maybe, possibly, sort of fit in. When Willa looks at Remy, she sees a girl who has everything. But for Remy, having everything comes at a price. And as she spirals out of control, Willa can feel Remy spinning right out of her grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrea Portes, author of the hilarious, heartbreaking &lt;em&gt;Anatomy of a Misfit&lt;/em&gt;, spins a similarly incandescent, heartfelt story that explores the meaning of friendship, new beginnings, and the precarious joy and devastating pain of finding home in a place&amp;#8212;a person&amp;#8212;with wings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
