  <title>I See London - Chanel Cleeton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Maggie Carpenter is ready for a change–and to leave her ordinary life in South Carolina behind. But when she accepts a scholarship to the International School in London, a university attended by the privileged offspring of diplomats and world leaders, Maggie might get more than she bargained for.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Maggie meets Hugh, a twentysomething British guy, she finds herself living the life she has always wanted. Suddenly she&#39;s riding around the city in a Ferrari, wearing borrowed designer clothes and going to the hottest clubs. The only problem? Another guy, the one she can&#39;t seem to keep her hands off of.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Half French, half Lebanese and ridiculously wealthy, Samir Khouri has made it clear he doesn&#39;t do relationships. He&#39;s the opposite of everything Maggie thought she wanted…and he&#39;s everything she can&#39;t resist. Torn between her dream guy and the boy haunting her dreams, Maggie has to fight for her own happy ending. In a city like London, you never know where you stand, and everything can change in the blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;This is a New Adult romance recommended for readers 17 and up.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;I See London&lt;/em&gt; is fun, sexy, and kept me completely absorbed.&quot; –Katie McGarry, author of &lt;em&gt;Crash Into You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
