  <title>Everything for a Dog - Ann M. Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this companion to her acclaimed 2005 novel, &lt;i&gt;A Dog&#39;s Life&lt;/i&gt;, Ann M. Martin tells the parallel stories of a stray dog (the brother of the dog featured in &lt;i&gt;A Dog&#39;s Life&lt;/i&gt;), a boy dealing with unspeakable loss, and a boy whose most ardent wish is to own a dog--and everything for a dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bone and his sister, Squirrel, are stray dogs born in a shed. Left motherless as puppies, the two dogs survive together for a while, but are soon wrenched apart. Bone doesn&#39;t know if his sister is still alive, and must now go on, alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie is a boy who has suffered a terrible loss. And, as he&#39;s healing with the help of his dog, another tragedy occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry&#39;s best friend has moved away. All Henry has wanted is a dog of his own. But his parents won&#39;t let him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bone, Charlie, and Henry live very different lives, but they are fated to intersect in surprising ways. Award-winning author Ann M. Martin has written a powerful, heartfelt novel that&#39;s perfect for anyone who has ever longed for a dog, or loved one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
