  <title>Dreaming Darkly - Caitlin Kittredge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This teen gothic mystery novel, perfect for fans of Madeleine Roux and Lisa Maxwell, takes readers to the cold, creepy island of Darkhaven, where a girl with unexplained blackouts grapples with secrets from her dead mother&amp;#8217;s past and a legacy of murders that have been committed by her family. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivy Bloodgood&amp;#8217;s mother is dead, and she should probably be sad about it. But she isn&amp;#8217;t. Myra Bloodgood was a manipulative personality who never told the truth&amp;#8212;about where she came from, who Ivy&amp;#8217;s father was, or why they were living their lives on the run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that Ivy has been sent to the family estate on Darkhaven, an island off the New England coast, she is forced to reckon with her mother&amp;#8217;s past. Ivy can tell right away there are long-held family secrets buried within these walls, but when she wakes up from one of her nightmares covered in someone else&amp;#8217;s blood, Ivy fears that whatever demons her mother battled while she was alive have come to roost in her own mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scared that she can no longer trust what she sees, Ivy seeks the help of a boy who thinks her episodes are connected to the sordid history of Darkhaven&amp;#8212;but what they don&amp;#8217;t know might kill them both.&lt;/p&gt;" />
