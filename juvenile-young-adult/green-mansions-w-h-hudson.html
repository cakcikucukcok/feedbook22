  <title>Green Mansions - W. H. Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Green Mansions: A Romance of the Tropical Forest is an exotic romance by the British-Argentine naturalist William Henry Hudson. The story tells of a traveller to the Guyana jungle of southeastern Venezuela and his encounter with a forest dwelling girl named Rima. As a primary theme, the novel explores the potential damage inherent in contact between European and indigenous cultures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A failed revolutionary attempt drives the hero of Hudson&amp;#39;s novel to seek refuge in the primeval forests of south-western Venezuela. There, in the &amp;#39;green mansions&amp;#39; of the title, Abel encounters the wood-nymph Rima, the last survivor of a mysterious aboriginal race. The love that flowers between them is soon overshadowed by cruelty and sorrow...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the acknowledged masters of natural history writing, W. H. Hudson forms an important link between nineteenth-century Romanticism and the twentieth-century ecological movement. First published in 1904 and a bestseller after its reissue a dozen years later, Green Mansions offers its readers a poignant meditation on the loss of wilderness, the dream of a return to nature, and the bitter reality of the encounter between savage and civilized man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hudson presents a moving and mysterious romance against a backdrop of great natural beauty. Books as rich as &amp;quot;Green Mansions&amp;quot; need to be savored, like good wine. The story flows naturally and poetically. Though written over a hundred years ago, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem at all dated. The plot and the pacing are superb, and Hudson&amp;#39;s storytelling is particularly fascinating." />
