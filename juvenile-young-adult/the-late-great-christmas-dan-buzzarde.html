  <title>The Late Great Christmas - Dan Buzzarde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wanda Fieldmouse was very intelligent, even for a mouse. Now normally, intelligent mice make every endeavor to avoid contact with humans, however intelligent those humans may be. All that changed for Wanda, however, when she awakened Christmas Eve morning.
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was the moaning and groaning that caught Wandas attention, but then she saw the headlines in the papers: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Santa Sick!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; and&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt; Rudolphs Nose Turns Blue!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Christmas Giving May Be Canceled!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Wanda was horrified  Christmas without presents?! No! she said. No! This is just not acceptable. Christmas without Santa! No! &lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Everyone was talking about the problem, but no one seemed inclined to do anything about it. Well, for Wanda, it just wouldnt do, so against every judgement she had, including her better one, she went to the humans and told them her plan. &lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, by this time the humans were willing to accept help on any level, and mouse or no, they welcomed Wandas willingness to help. Please help us! they wailed. We must have Christmas!&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wanda, good-hearted creature that she was, said,  Okay, I think I know just what to do. In the case of St. Nick, Ill unbite the snow-tick, and Ill wrap Rudolphs nose with unblue and then everything will be just fine! And with that,she set off to save Christmas . . . for the entire world! Read to find out how a mouse managed to save Christmas . . . even for us humans! &lt;/DIV&gt;
