  <title>The Smiling Owl - Raad Chalabi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="RAMIZ ALKHISHIN, the authors alter ego, is a
grocer. He has a passion for a life that is as independent
as possible from its surroundings. To him the trendy
place to be in is the one to avoid, while the traditional
road to follow is the one to by-pass.He was once asked
as to what is the most appealing feature of animals? Their
indifference to what I think and believe was his reply.
Ramiz through thirty nine dialectic scenes looks at life
through the eyes of animals. A rabbit, upon seeing the
title of this book, had the following dialogue with an owl:
Rabbit: How come you never smile?
Owl: Who said I dont?
Rabbit: Your face says so.
Owl: Ah; that sort of smile.
Rabbit: Is there another kind?
Owl: Unpublicised, refl ecting inner tranquillity.
Rabbit: But then it is not apparent?
Owl: Why does it need to be?
Rabbit: We may otherwise assume you are unhappy.
Owl: Why should that concern me?" />
