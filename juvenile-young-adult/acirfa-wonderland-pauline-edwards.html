  <title>Acirfa Wonderland - Pauline Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Acirfa Wonderland is a magical island ruled by three kings and their queens with the divine guidance of the gods Ra and Asar and the goddesses Maat and Aset.
King Babatunde is the ruler of the Silver clan; he has everything, but is not satisfied. He wants to see rest of the world.  Against the advice of his wife and the two other kings he set sail with some of his men to explore the unknown world. Weeks later he returns with some strangers whose leader is the evil Montell. 
Montell becomes King Babatundes chief advisor; he introduces new rules and practices which causes chaos and terror amongst the islanders. King Barak Diamond clan and King Enu Gold clan come under heavy attack and are no match for Montells fire power.  The high priest Seth prophesised that four young children have been chosen by the gods to challenge Montell supremacy." />
