  <title>Puck of Pook&#39;s Hill - Rudyard Kipling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Puck of Pook&amp;#39;s Hill is a fantasy book by Rudyard Kipling, published in 1906, containing a series of short stories set in different periods of English history. It can count both as historical fantasy &amp;ndash; since some of the stories told of the past have clear magical elements, and as contemporary fantasy &amp;ndash; since it depicts a magical being active and practising his magic in the England of the early 1900s when the book was written.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stories are all narrated to two children living near Burwash, in the area of Kipling&amp;#39;s own house Bateman&amp;#39;s, by people magically plucked out of history by the elf Puck, or told by Puck himself. (Puck, who refers to himself as &amp;quot;the oldest Old Thing in England&amp;quot;, is better known as a character in William Shakespeare&amp;#39;s play A Midsummer Night&amp;#39;s Dream.) The genres of particular stories range from authentic historical novella (A Centurion of the Thirtieth, On the Great Wall) to children&amp;#39;s fantasy (Dymchurch Flit). Each story is bracketed by a poem which relates in some manner to the theme or subject of the story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Donald Mackenzie, who wrote the introduction for the Oxford World&amp;#39;s Classics edition of Puck of Pook&amp;#39;s Hill in 1987, has described this book as an example of archaeological imagination that, in fragments, delivers a look at the history of England, climaxing with the signing of Magna Carta.&lt;br /&gt;
