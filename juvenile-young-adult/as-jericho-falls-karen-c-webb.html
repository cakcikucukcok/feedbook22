  <title>As Jericho Falls - Karen C Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A secret lies hidden in the town of Jericho Falls, North Carolina. A naked teenage boy, locked in a cage for eight years.&lt;br /&gt; Lauren, a fifteen year old girl who&amp;#39;s never been to school, never been anywhere, but dreams of traveling the world, discovers Jeremy by accident and befriends the wild boy. After learning that he&amp;#39;s actually incredibly smart, she plans to tame this wild boy. She brings him treats, she teaches him to read, all the while falling deeply in love with him.&lt;br /&gt; But there are more secrets the mountains are hiding. Jeremy&amp;#39;s daddy is an evil, drunken man who locked his son away. His mama is a faith healer who&amp;#39;s known in the mountains as a bit of a witch.&lt;br /&gt; As Lauren makes plans with Jeremy to free him of his cage and run away with him, she must also hide from his evil father, who seems to know that she&amp;#39;s been sneaking into his home and visiting his son.&lt;br /&gt; But, as Jericho falls, Lauren soon learns more of the secrets the mountains are hiding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;A&amp;nbsp;very promising story with richly drawn characters and settings that create an immersive reading experience like no other. The hauntingly beautiful hills of North Carolina come alive in the pages of this story, and Lauren&amp;#39;s heartrending tale is poignantly told in first person narrative. The author has an incredible talent for relating the angst Lauren feels.&amp;nbsp;A powerful, alluring tale that will impact readers in a very personal way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reader&amp;#39;s Favorite&lt;/p&gt;" />
