  <title>Three Silly Ducks - Debbie Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My life has revolved around caring for children since I was 13 years old. I put my life on the line to make sure children are safe and happy. My favorite part about caring for children is reading to them. I never went through a childrens story without thinking to myself, I can make this kid laugh and be entertained like that!!. So I started writing. I wrote stories without pictures. I read them to children that I cared for at the time, and the majority of the time, they loved it! Depending on their age, they even asked me to read it again and again. 
	This book that I chose to publish first, is because of my niece, Addison! When my sister got her first sonogram picture of her, I was very impatient to finally see it, only to realize that my niece looked like a rubber ducky!! It was adorable to me, so I started calling her my little rubber ducky. That ended up getting to be an extremely long nickname so I shortened it to my ducky. She is now 2 years old and she answers to ducky when I call her. 
	One day I thought about another idea for a story, which of course, Addy, was my key!! She absolutely loved it!! She still loves it so much, that she now asks to read my book when its nowhere to be found. Read duckys! Read duckys!, she says to me. I love that I made her so happy with it. Its definitely a short book, but it was never meant to get published. It was just to make sure I could see my beautiful nieces smile. And it worked. Then I thought about it: Write a childrens story, read it to Addy, publish and dedicate it to her, and make other parents see their toddlers smile too!! Sounds good to me!!" />
