  <title>Keeper of the Arts - Jackie Grant Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Severe abuse marked D.J. Grant&#39;s childhood while he lived with his mother, until he was suddenly sent away to live with an unknown father. His life changed again when he and his father saw a martial arts movie, which influenced him to learn self-defense. Now in his early twenties and a student of Tae Kwon Do, D.J. is excited about a promotion from second degree to third degree black belt status. 
&lt;p&gt;
D.J. had specialized in one style of self-defense. Now he faces disappointment when, instead of promotion, his instructor tells him to first experience the history of the martial arts world. During a walk home, a brief discussion ensues with two friends. D.J. is inexplicably separated from them and introduced to Nerrot, Master of all Keepers of the Art. This meeting takes place in SymDo, a subconscious, mystical realm existing within the minds of martial arts students and practitioners. For every martial artist, there is a Keeper of the Art who is responsible for maintaining the martial artist&#39;s memories. 
&lt;p&gt;
Nerrot, the Master of all the Keepers of the Arts, has chosen D.J. to replace him as the next master.
&lt;p&gt;
Before D.J. can succeed Nerrot, he is pitted against Tarag, a former protg who was exiled from the Five Sacred Temples of SymDo for stealing a pendant that can be used to control the mystical powers. 
&lt;p&gt;
D.J. is taken to five countries to experience and learn their martial arts histories. Tarag&#39;s interference forces D.J. and Nerrot to physically experience historic events that put their lives at risk. D.J. must complete the experiences, helping Nerrot to save SymDo, while outwitting Tarag." />
