  <title>Our Land Is the Sky - Frank J. Croskerry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spring has been a violent affair this year, and many new crows have not survived the high winds and rainstorms. For the few who have, there are still the very dangerous exercises of learning what birds need to know to exist with the rest of the clan. While flying comes naturally to them, there is much more they need to know if they are to stay out of harms reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young crow Jimmy Fastwing has his grandfather to teach him the basic things a young crow needs to know. If he can manage the first stages of take-offs and landings, there will be other family members to assist him in his learning. Hell have to know about things like finding food, hiding it, and socializing with the clan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Jimmy in his first year of life as he grows, learns, and avoids one calamity after another. If hes lucky, hell learn quickly enough to become an important member of the clan.&lt;/p&gt;
