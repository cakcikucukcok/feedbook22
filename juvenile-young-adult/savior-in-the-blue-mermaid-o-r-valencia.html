  <title>Savior in the Blue Mermaid - O. R. Valencia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Deep beneath the Ocean lives creatures waiting to enlighten you. The sea is filled with many mysteries waiting to be unfold.
SAVIOR is the narrator. He will be speaking to you through out the book. So if you have a question - dont be surprised to hear him answer you. Prosperity is a good thing to wish for if you use it right. OR - like that old saying goes - be careful what you wish for. Savior is in love and will do anything for his true love. He seeks to sail across the sea in search for blueberries for his love Savanna. Without the charms of a mermaid singing poems of enchantment what would this story be? I wouldnt be surprised to hear you start singing along. Zoe the blue mermaid is a cheerleader at the Atlantic Under Sea High School. Ravens, Wizards, Gnomes and Green Men will be present. Ah - yes... Lets not forget about the GODS (Greek Mythology). Zeus is always watching you. Join me as we find mystery and adventure as we meet up with Pirates. You will laugh your tail off when you read what the ZANY and REALISTIC mermaids and mermen will do just for that romantic love in his/her life.
....Join Savior as he sails across the sea for adventure..." />
