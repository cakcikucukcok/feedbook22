  <title>Girl with Wings - Jennifer Bradley, Rob Cowan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jessica Mackay has one dream - to be a pilot. Jessica lives on her family farm at Narromine, New South Wales, in the 1920s - the best place for a would-be pilot. Her father developed a passion for flying in Egypt during World War I, and Narromine lies close to the heart of Australia&#39;s budding aviation industry.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though women were among the first people to take on the challenge of the skies, Jessica&#39;s ambitions are not supported by everyone, most notably her grandfather who has firm ideas about &#39;a woman&#39;s place&#39; in the world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a junior member of the new Narromine Aero Club, Jessica is well-placed to meet pioneer aviators such as the legendary Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, as well as take part in the first Narromine Air Shows.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Bradley&#39;s story of a young girl&#39;s passion for flying is based firmly on actual events in the fledgling Australian aviation industry." />
