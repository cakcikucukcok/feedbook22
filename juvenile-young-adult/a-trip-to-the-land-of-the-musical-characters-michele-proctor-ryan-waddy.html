  <title>A Trip to the Land of the Musical Characters - Michele Proctor, Ryan Waddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Trip to the Land of the Musical Characters is a fun filled book; full of imagination about a little girl named Sara who saved a magical land from deterring from a mischievous bee.  Sara Zimmerman is a small girl with a lot of heart.  She had enough heart to bring down a giant bee and restore The Land of the Musical Characters.  After entering this land from playing a keyboard and going into a slight trance she meets musical characters that take her on a journey that she would never forget.
I wrote this book because I had an encounter with musical beings when I took keyboarding in school.  I wanted to share them with the world.  Many small children have seen them too." />
