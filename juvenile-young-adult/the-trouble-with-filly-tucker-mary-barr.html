  <title>The Trouble with Filly Tucker - Mary Barr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young witchlin Filly Tucker has a problem. In order to earn her wand, she must master her basic spells before her tenth birthday. In a cozy cottage where she lives with her Grandmaa famous witch extraordinaireand her ornery magic cat, Tabasco, Filly struggles to get even the simplest spell right.
One afternoon, as Filly arrives home from rolling down grassy hills with her friends, she discovers a large cardboard box outside her front doorwaiting to transport her to the home of the terrible Twissle twins, known for their unruly, madcap lifestyle and obnoxious spells. As the Twissle twins rely on their horrid personalities and crazy tricks to create green meatballs, coax a dozen Canadian geese to soar around the chandelier, and convince a cat who thinks he is a cowboy to ride around the room on the back of a flying Dalmatian dog, Filly realizes she should have paid better attention while learning her spells.
Filly quickly learns that it is up to her to make things right, but she needs to master her spells first. Only time will tell if Filly Tucker will ever earn her wand." />
