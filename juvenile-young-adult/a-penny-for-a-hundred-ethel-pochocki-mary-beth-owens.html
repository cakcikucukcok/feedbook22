  <title>A Penny for a Hundred - Ethel Pochocki, Mary Beth Owens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;A Penny for a Hundred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is beloved children&amp;#39;s book author Ethel Pockocki&amp;#39;s timeless tale of culture shock in rural Maine during the Second World War. It is 1944 and nine-year-old Clare will finally be able to help with the potato harvest&amp;mdash;up until now, she was only able to earn the &amp;quot;penny a hundred&amp;quot; her father paid her to pick potato bugs off the plants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, with so many local men off fighting the war, German POWs are brought in to help with the harvest. Clare&amp;#39;s not sure what to expect from the strangers, but it soon becomes clear that these men are not so different from young American soldiers&amp;mdash;they are relieved to be out of the fighting, but sad to be so far from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Christmas, Clare is determined to recreate at least one familiar tradition for Peter, a POW who has befriended her. Their gifts for one another strengthen the bonds of their friendship and help both the POWs and Clare&amp;#39;s family enjoy a memorable Christmas Eve. Even amid the hardships of war, they find much to give each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
