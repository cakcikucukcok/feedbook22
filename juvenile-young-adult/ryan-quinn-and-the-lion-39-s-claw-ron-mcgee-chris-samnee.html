  <title>Ryan Quinn and the Lion&#39;s Claw - Ron McGee, Chris Samnee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;A suspenseful, just-won&amp;#8217;t-quit adventure thriller.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;Ridley Pearson, author of the Kingdom Keepers series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan Quinn and the Lion&amp;#8217;s Claw&lt;/em&gt; is the much-awaited sequel in the thrilling series about Ryan Quinn, a New York City teenager who would give James Bond and Jason Bourne a run for their money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Quinn has never been a normal kid, and after everything that happened in Andakar, he&amp;#8217;s about as far away from normal as could be. His parents want him to forget all about his death-defying escape, his role in the Emergency Rescue Committee, and the fact that they&amp;#8217;ve been keeping secrets from him his whole life. But forgetting just isn&amp;#8217;t an option for Ryan&amp;#8212;not when there&amp;#8217;s a traitor in the ERC who&amp;#8217;s looking to ruin Ryan&amp;#8217;s parents and expose the whole organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsure where to turn or who to trust, Ryan and his friends Danny and Kasey soon find themselves on another adventure, across the world, to help a musician whose words have started a revolution. It&amp;#8217;s a globe-trotting mission more treacherous than Ryan could have ever imagined. And just when he feels like he&amp;#8217;s cracked the final clue, Ryan stumbles across the biggest secret of all&amp;#8212;and it&amp;#8217;s about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of Alex Rider and Spy School will be completely enthralled by the second book in Ron McGee&amp;#8217;s high-stakes Ryan Quinn series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
