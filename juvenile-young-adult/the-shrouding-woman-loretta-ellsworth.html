  <title>The Shrouding Woman - Loretta Ellsworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The moving story of a young girl&#39;s struggle to face her mother&#39;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;She traveled to our small white house near the Iowa border on a buckboard, her green bag caked with the dusty road . . . I knew that she was called &quot;the Shrouding Woman&quot; because I&#39;d heard Papa use those words to describe her. I didn&#39;t know what it meant but I knew it had something to do with death.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once common practice for small towns to have a shrouding woman to help put their dead to rest. Still, when eleven-year-old Evie&#39;s Aunt Flo-herself a shrouding woman-comes to town, Evie knows little of a shrouding woman&#39;s ways and wants nothing to do with this aunt of hers, especially after her own mother&#39;s recent death. But as this mysterious woman slowly makes her way into Evie&#39;s life, her strong and sensitive presence brings far more than signs of death to a grieving girl&#39;s home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in the mid-1800s, this beautifully written story, centered on the little-known practice of shrouding, touches on death and healing with sensitivity and quiet dignity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
