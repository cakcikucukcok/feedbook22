  <title>The Summer of Everything - Catherine Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This bind-up features two repackaged fan-favorite novels that are sure to delight readers of Stephanie Perkins, Jennifer Echols, and, of course, Catherine Clark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer vacation isn&amp;#8217;t just about working on your tan line and flirting with the lifeguard. . . . For two teenage girls in two irresistibly romantic novels it&amp;#8217;s also a chance to learn that sometimes leaving home is the best way to find yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Picture Perfect&lt;/em&gt;, Emily can&amp;#8217;t wait to spend her summer on the beautiful beaches of the Outer Banks, North Carolina. It has been two years since she went on a trip with her three closest childhood friends&amp;#8212;two years that she&amp;#8217;s hoping will erase the memory of the last time she saw Spencer, the boy who broke her heart. And what better way to forget about Spencer than to have the perfect summer fling with Blake, the boy living in the beach house next door? But embarking on a new romance is more difficult than she expected when her feelings for her first love aren&amp;#8217;t exactly a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Wish You Were Here&lt;/em&gt;, Ariel is embarking on the summer vacation of a lifetime&amp;#8212;at least, she hopes this is the only trip like this she&amp;#8217;ll ever take. Stuck on an &amp;#8220;America&amp;#8217;s Heartland&amp;#8221; bus tour with her family, leaving her amazing boyfriend back home, and maintaining her track-team endurance by sprinting through rest stop parking lots? Who could survive four weeks of that? But as she spends more time with the intriguing, also-miserable Andre, Ariel begins to learn that sometimes you just have to go where the road takes you&amp;#8212;even if the tour bus won&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;" />
