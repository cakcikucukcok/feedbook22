  <title>Minion - John David Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John David Anderson returns to the world of superheroes he created in &lt;em&gt;Sidekicked&lt;/em&gt; with an entirely new cast of characters in &lt;em&gt;Minion&lt;/em&gt;, a funny and emotional companion to his first breakout tween novel&amp;#8212;perfect for superhero fans who also love the work of bestselling authors Rick Riordan, Louis Sachar, and Frank Cottrell Boyce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Morn might be a villain, but he&#39;s really not a bad guy. When you live in New Liberty, there are no Supers and only two kinds of people: those who turn to crime and those who suffer. Michael and his adoptive father spend their days building boxes&amp;#8212;special devices with mysterious abilities&amp;#8212;that they sell to the mob at a price. They provide for each other, they look out for each other, and they&#39;d never betray each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then a Super comes to town, and Michael&#39;s world is thrown into disarray. The Comet could destroy everything Michael and his dad have built, the safe and secure life they&#39;ve made for themselves. And now Michael and his father face a choice: to hold tight to their life or to let it unravel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
