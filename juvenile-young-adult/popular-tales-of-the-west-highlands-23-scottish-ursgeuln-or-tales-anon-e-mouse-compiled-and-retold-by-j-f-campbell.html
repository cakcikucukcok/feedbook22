  <title>POPULAR TALES of the WEST HIGHLANDS - 23 Scottish ursgeuln or tales - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and retold by J. F. Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This 1st volume contains 23 Scottish &lt;i&gt;ursgeuln, &lt;/i&gt;or tales, from the Western Highlands of Scotland. These are tales and stories in which something &amp;lsquo;Fairy&amp;rsquo; or magical occurs, something extraordinary--fairies, giants, dwarfs, speaking animals, or simply the remarkable stupidity of some of the characters.&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find tales like:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;The Young King Of Easaidh Ruadh,&lt;br /&gt;
The Battle Of The Birds,&lt;br /&gt;
The Tale Of The Hoodie,&lt;br /&gt;
The Sea-Maiden,&lt;br /&gt;
Conall Cra Bhuidhe,&lt;br /&gt;
The Tale Of Conal Crovi,&lt;br /&gt;
The Tale Of Connal,&lt;br /&gt;
Murchag A&amp;#39;s Mionachag and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But these aren&amp;rsquo;t just a collection of amusing and entertaining stories. In the days before schools these are the tales that were used to teach the lessons of life. The story of &lt;i&gt;MURCHAG A&amp;#39;S MIONACHAG, &lt;/i&gt;for example, is legendary among the Gaelic tales. It is the infant ladder to learning about the chain of cause and effect, and fully as sensible as any of its kind. It used to be commonly taught to children of five or six years of age, and repeated by school boys, and was often recalled by grownups in all parts of the Highlands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So take some time out and travel back to a period before television and radio, a time when tales were passed on orally--at the drying kilns, at the communal well or in homes, where families would gather around a crackling and spitting hearth and granddad or grandma or uncle or auntie would delight and captivate the gathering with stories passed on to them from their parents and grandparents from time immemorial.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
