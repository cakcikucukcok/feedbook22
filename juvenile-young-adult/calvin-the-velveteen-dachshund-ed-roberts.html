  <title>Calvin the Velveteen Dachshund - Ed Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All puppies need a good home where they get food, water, and lots of love. Our puppy is no different. A little dachshund black and tan, he arrives at the pet store with many other puppies of many shapes and sizes. He watches day after day as many of his friends go home to their forever families, where they will be loved and cared for, and he wishes for a family. Soon he is one of the oldest puppies at the pet shop, and he wonders when he will get to go home with a family. But then a little girl comes into the shop and notices him-very handsome, and soft and warm, just the way a puppy is supposed to be. Will she take him home? Calvin the Velveteen Dachshund is the tale of a sweet puppy who is looking for his forever home and the family that will love him and make him their own." />
