  <title>The Bubbleretta - Doris N. Bullock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Each spring the fifth-grade students of LaFlaweless School are expected to put on the most perfect talent show at the annual Bubbleretta! Everyone looks forward to the production. Celita is less than enthusiastic about participating. Unlike her twin brother, Cy, who is an exceptional drummer and her very talented friends, Celita doesnt have a talent she feels is worthy of being shown to the entire community. Her passion is science, but that category has never been featured at the Bubbleretta.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a long-established tradition that has to take place before the Bubbleretta rehearsals begin. The two fifth-grade classes must compete to earn the beloved title  Lead Class of the Bubbleretta. The Lead Class is in charge of the Bubbleretta and gets extra privileges. Earning the title is difficult, and friction occurs between the rival classes.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When the Bubbleretta rehearsals begin, Celita doesnt want to be involved. One day she accidentally receives information that causes her to have a different outlook about the place where she has lived all her life. Deciding how to handle that newly acquired knowledge presents a challenge for Celita.&lt;/p&gt;" />
