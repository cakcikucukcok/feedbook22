  <title>No Room for Anna - J. Blythe Ammons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
The inspiration for &lt;b&gt;No Room for Anna&lt;/b&gt; came when my children were ages two and newborn.  I was driving home with both of my children crying in the backseat, all the while trying to assure them that we were nearly there.  I felt like crying too, so I started to pray.
&lt;p&gt;
At that time in my life, when I should have been most joyous and thankful, I felt sad and depressed.  I hardly slept or ate and I felt that motherhood was a mountain in front of me.  I worried that my children would feel my anxiety.
&lt;p&gt;
When nearly home, I grabbed a napkin from the seat of the car and wrote notes as I pulled into the drive.  I then shuffled the babies into the house, fed, changed and cuddled them.  When they were happy, I deciphered my napkin notes and composed the story.  I cried as I wrote the final page, because the message spoke to me.
&lt;p&gt;
We all have a place and a purpose in the world and though we go through seasons of difficulty, we can see beauty in each situation if we choose to.  Now looking back I am grateful that I didn&#39;t miss a day with my babies.  They grew up so fast.
