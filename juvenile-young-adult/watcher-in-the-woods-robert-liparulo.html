But the Kings know that even if they told the truth about the bizarre things happening in their house, no one would believe them. They&#39;re hyper-focused on rescuing their lost family member before anyone finds out what&#39;s going on. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But when a stranger shows up to take their house, their options start dwindling fast. Why would he be so interested in a run-down old place? And what secret is he hiding--just as he hides the scars that crisscross his body?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mystery gets stranger with each passing day. Will the Kings be able to find a way to harness the house&#39;s secrets and discover who is watching their every move before another gets snatched into an unknown world?&lt;BR&gt;" />
