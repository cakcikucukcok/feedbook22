  <title>The Monkey Story - Wylie Ramos, Dwight Nacaytuna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One day, two little monkeys were so bored they didnt know what to do. They were tired of playing with their puzzles, video games, and all the other toys, and for once, they did all their chores early that day. They couldnt think of anything to do, so JT was just hanging around the house while Ana was playing with her favorite stuffed rabbit. It had big fluffy ears. One of the ears, the left one, is always bent down in front of his eye. It had a button for a nose. It was something her mother made her when she was a baby. She loved playing with it, and she took it everywhere she went. She suggested that they play hide-and-seek. JT played hide-and-seek with his sister before he knew that she was afraid of heights, and she was always the first to be found. Not wanting to hurt her feelings, he just said no and decided to just hang around the house, thinking it was better than playing with his little sister.
He goes to see what his mother was up to. He finds her in the kitchen, but it wasnt long until she got tired of bumping into him. She asked him if he wanted to help her. This is something he really did not want to dohelping his mother in the house with the cooking and the cleaning. She really could have used his help, but he said no and wandered off to see what his father was doing." />
