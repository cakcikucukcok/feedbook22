  <title>Dr. Abraham’S Happy Little Stories - Malouf Abraham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abraham says that when babies come out of their mommies tummies, they immediately start gathering data. They have empty shelves to put new information on, so the stories they hear help shape their personalities. The more curious kids become, the better, since curious kids grow to be creators, inventors, and artistsspecial people who think outside the box and get the most out of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dr. Abrahams Happy Little Stories, read tall tales about loving families and adventurous children. Its true that parents might exaggerate a bit, but its all part of storytelling and nurturing the creative mind. Four fantastical interludes introduce characters like Hazel Larue and Harold, parents known for spinning silly stories. Plus, meet the kidsDonny Leroy, and Peggy Suewho are clever and kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theres also Howard Hudson Holt Jr., better known as Harry, who not only makes friends with a snake but also learns the truth about earwax. Read the mad adventures of parents and children, all of whom think outside the box and revel in the beauty of imagination. Sometimes its good to be silly, flex the creative muscles, and maybe, someday, make up tall tales of your own!&lt;/p&gt;" />
