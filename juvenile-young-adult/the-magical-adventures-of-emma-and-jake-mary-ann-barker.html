  <title>The Magical Adventures of Emma and Jake - Mary Ann Barker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recently, I visited with my great nieces,their parents and grandmother.  They were as excited about my visit as I was to experience them and all their tales of wonder.  Most of their chit chat was very lively and reminded me to not be an adult in their company.  
Upon getting ready to leave, they were thrilled to show me (their aunt who they know as an artist) their artwork on canvas boards.  Well to say the least their artistic abilities blew me away.  Without regard for shape or color co-ordination, there was paint, applied on every inch of the surface and texture created by whatever means possible.  
It instantly impressed on me how like a child one has to think when creating art and story line for children.  I left with a feeling of renewed purpose and that was to write and paint pictures for my first childrens story book..!  It did not take me long to have the characters  painted on 14 x 14 gallery frameless canvases and a story line playing in my mind,  As I continued to create paintings of the House on the hill where Emma lived and her best friend Jake who lived next door,  then to the family pet, Sparky the Dalmatian puppy.  
The Magical Adventure takes Emma and Jake to a Sailing Ferry Boat which crosses a shallow stream with lots to see. Upon their arrival to the park, the brilliant large sun captivates them as they wander throughout the large flowers and brilliant green trees and shrubs. 
What they encounter along the path of the park, are many vivid and lively creatures all entertaining and educational. 
Enjoy &quot;The Magical Adventures of Emma and Jake&quot; as illustrated and written by Mary Ann Barker" />
