  <title>Planet Jupiter - Jane Kurtz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jupiter is used to being a planet of one, and she likes it that way. But then a cousin, who Jupiter never even knew existed, comes from Ethiopia to stay for the summer, and Jupiter is put in charge of taking care of her. A lyrical and memorable story of family, friendship, and community&amp;#8212;perfect for fans of Katherine Hannigan&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Ida B&lt;/em&gt; and Holly Goldberg Sloan&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Counting by 7s&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jupiter and her family have spent their lives on the road, moving from town to town in a trusty old van and earning their living by playing music for tourists. But when their van breaks down, Jupiter&amp;#8217;s mother rents an actual house in Portland for the summer so Jupiter&amp;#8217;s annoying cousin Edom, recently adopted from Ethiopia, can stay with them. Luckily, Edom doesn&amp;#8217;t want to be in Portland any more than Jupiter wants her there, and the two hatch a Grand Plan to send Edom back to her mother. In the process, Jupiter learns that community and family aren&amp;#8217;t always what you expect them to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sweet, genuine story with themes of community, immigration, finances, family, and taking care of the environment that will appeal to fans of Cynthia Lord and Lynda Mullaly Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;" />
