  <title>ScareBoo&#39;s Halloween Trick - Anita E. Shepherd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ScareBoo is a scarecrow with a pumpkin head that is carved as a jack-o-lantern. He is the protector of the pumpkin patch and guards it from the crows, who always try to get past him every year to eat all the pumpkins. But ScareBoo performs a special trick that scares them away; however, he has been slowly losing his confidence because no one knows about him anymore...and the crows know it. If ScareBoo can&#39;t perform his trick, the crows will have all the pumpkins they want and there will be none for anybody else. This also means that Holiday Management will close down his post forever. This story is about Brad and Chad, who once again find themselves helping a holiday character in need. But how can they help someone whom they have never heard of? Can they help ScareBoo regain his confidence in the midst of fear? Maybe, with a little Trick or Treat magic, Brad and Chad can keep ScareBoo from giving up on himself and save his post as protector of the pumpkin patch!" />
