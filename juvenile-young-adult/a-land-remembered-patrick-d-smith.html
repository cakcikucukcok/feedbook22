  <title>A Land Remembered - Patrick D. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this best-selling novel, Patrick Smith tells the story of three generations of the MacIveys, a Florida family who battle the hardships of the frontier to rise from a dirt-poor Cracker life to the wealth and standing of real estate tycoons. The story opens in 1858, when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son, and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey, who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need.&lt;p&gt;The sweeping story that emerges is a rich, rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty, indomitable Crackers battling wild animals, rustlers, Confederate deserters, mosquitoes, starvation, hurricanes, and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed, including finally their own.&lt;p&gt;Love and tenderness are here too: the hopes and passions of each new generation, friendships with the persecuted blacks and Indians, and respect for the land and its wildlife.&lt;p&gt;Patrick Smith&#39;s novel is now available for young readers. A teacher&#39;s manual is available for using &lt;i&gt;A Land Remembered&lt;/i&gt; to teach language arts, social studies, and science coordinated with the Sunshine State Standards of the Florida Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;" />
