      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A thrilling new novella from the author of the Everneath series!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack is trapped for eternity in the Tunnels while Nikki has managed to evade Cole&#39;s grasp . . . for now. But Cole is more desperate than ever to find answers about Nikki, his best chance for taking over the throne of the underworld. How did she survive the Feed? Can Cole find another Forfeit like her who can survive it too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cole&#39;s quest leads him to the other side of the world, to a mysterious, dangerous society known as the Delphinians, whose price for information might be higher than Cole can pay&amp;#8212;a price that could destroy Nikki. But when Cole attempts to steal the answers instead, his mission ends in disaster. Faced with centuries in a Delphinian dungeon, Cole is confronted with questions he&#39;s been too scared to ask himself: Is he really obsessed with the throne&amp;#8212;or is he obsessed with Nikki? And can she really give him a new beginning as the Everneath&#39;s king . . . or will she instead bring about his tragic end?&lt;/p&gt;" />
