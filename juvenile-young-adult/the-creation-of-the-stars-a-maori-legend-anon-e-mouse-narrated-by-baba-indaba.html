  <title>THE CREATION OF THE STARS - A Maori Legend - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 455&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this 455th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Maori legend of &amp;quot;The Creation of the Stars&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE, UPON A TIME, a long, long time ago and far, far away in the land of Aotearoa &amp;ndash; the Land of the Long White Cloud, Te Ra, the day-eye of Rangi was closing, and sending a last glowing look over the peacefully dreaming Moana-rarapa - the Lake of the Glittering Water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tane looked up to the heavens and said, &amp;ldquo;O, father Rangi, my heart is looking upon you in sorrow, for you are lonely and cold, and I will go in quest for adornments which shall make you beautiful to the eyes of Papa and her children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
And so began the wanderings of Tane&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well it happened as it has been written. But where did the go and where did he end up. What adornments did he find, if any at all? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
