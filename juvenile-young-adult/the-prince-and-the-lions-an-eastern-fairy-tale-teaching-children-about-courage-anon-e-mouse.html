  <title>THE PRINCE AND THE LIONS - An Eastern Fairy Tale teaching Children about Courage - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 363&lt;br /&gt;
In this 363th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE PRINCE AND THE LIONS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away, in an Eastern city there once lived a young Prince named Azgid. He was virtuous and accomplished, but had one fault&amp;mdash;he was a bit of a coward!&lt;br /&gt;
Prince Azgid&amp;#39;s father had recently died, and he was looking forward to his coronation. A few days before the day fixed for the ceremony, the old Vizier called upon the Prince and informed His Royal Highness that before he could ascend the throne he must in accordance with an ancient custom, fight a certain huge red lion which was kept in a den within the precincts of the palace.&lt;br /&gt;
The Prince, upon hearing this, was so frightened that he made up his mind to run away. He rose in the night, dressed himself hastily, mounted his horse, and left the city. Thus he journeyed for three days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the course of the third day, as he rode through a beautiful thickly-wooded country, he heard the sound of exquisite music, and presently overtook a handsome youth, who was leading a few sheep, and playing upon a flute. The young man having courteously saluted the stranger, Prince Azgid begged him to go on playing, for never in his life before, said the Prince, had he listened to such enchanting strains. The player then told Azgid that he was the slave of the wealthy shepherd named Oaxus, to whose abode, which was close at hand, he offered to conduct the traveller.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Prince gladly accepted this invitation, and in a few moments was entering the house of Oaxus, who accorded him a hearty welcome, and placed food and drink before him. When Azgid had finished his meal, he introduced himself as the prince. After which he was given a tour of the estate. After wandering awhile amidst romantic scenery, the two young men sat down to rest upon a rock in a shady valley. The slave put his flute to his lips, and began to play. The prince loved music passionately, and the idea had already occurred to him that, if he ever left this fair retreat, he would like to purchase from Oaxus his accomplished slave. Suddenly Isdril broke the spell of the Prince&amp;#39;s enjoyment by rising to his feet, with the words: &amp;quot;It is time for us to be going.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wherefore?&amp;quot; queried the Prince. &amp;quot;Why should we quit this delicious spot so soon?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Because,&amp;quot; replied the other, &amp;quot;the neighbourhood is infested with lions. It is well, therefore, to retire early within our abodes, and close the gates for our protection.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Did they make it back in time or did they have to face the lions? Well many things happened, some strange, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
