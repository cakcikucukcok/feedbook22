      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On her thirteenth birthday, Scarlett Wrigley awakens to find the ordinary world isn&amp;rsquo;t what it seems. Up until then, she never even knew what Juma was. Now she can see the fairies and the leprechaun that have protected her all her life as well as auras and any and all fantastical creatures that live beneath the veil. Her Juma, or life-force, has grown too strong and they can no longer keep it from her. Now, dark creatures are after her, attracted to her light, and no-one will tell her why. For her protection, the fairies arrange to have Scarlett and her family move to a quiet town outside Washington DC, a town filled with lightworkers. Guided by her teacher and hidden by her protectors, Scarlett must learn how to control her new abilities before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
