  <title>Paperweight - Meg Haston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This emotionally haunting and beautifully written young adult debut delves into the devastating impact of trauma and loss, in the vein of Laurie Halse Anderson&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Wintergirls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Stevie is trapped. In her life. In her body. And now in an eating-disorder treatment center on the dusty outskirts of the New Mexico desert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life in the center is regimented and intrusive, a nightmare come true. Nurses and therapists watch Stevie at meal time, accompany her to the bathroom, and challenge her to eat the foods she&amp;#8217;s worked so hard to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her dad has signed her up for sixty days of treatment. But what no one knows is that Stevie doesn&amp;#8217;t plan to stay that long. There are only twenty-seven days until the anniversary of her brother Josh&amp;#8217;s death&amp;#8212;the death &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; caused. And if Stevie gets her way, there are only twenty-seven days until she, too, will end her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paperweight&lt;/em&gt; follows seventeen-year-old Stevie&amp;#8217;s journey as she struggles not only with a life-threatening eating disorder, but with the question of whether she can ever find absolution for the mistakes of her past&amp;#8230;and whether she truly deserves to.&lt;/p&gt;" />
