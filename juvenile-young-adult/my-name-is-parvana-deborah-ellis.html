  <title>My Name Is Parvana - Deborah Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortlisted for the IODE Violet Downey Book Award and the Manitoba Young Readers&#39; Choice Award, selected for the USBBY Outstanding International Book List, the CCBC Choices List, the Bank Street College of Education&#39;s Book of the Month, the Bankstreet College Best Children&amp;#8217;s Books of the Year 2013, and the Capitol Choices Noteworthy Titles for Children and Teens List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a military base in post-Taliban Afghanistan, American authorities have just imprisoned a teenaged girl found in a bombed-out school.  The army major thinks she may be a terrorist working with the Taliban. The girl does not respond to questions in any language and remains silent, even when she is threatened, harassed and mistreated over several days. The only clue to her identity is a tattered shoulder bag containing papers that refer to people named Shauzia, Nooria, Leila, Asif, Hassan -- and Parvana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this long-awaited sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Breadwinner Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;, Parvana is now fifteen years old. As she waits for foreign military forces to determine her fate, she remembers the past four years of her life. Reunited with her mother and sisters, she has been living in a village where her mother has finally managed to open a school for girls. But even though the Taliban has been driven from the government, the country is still at war, and many continue to view the education and freedom of girls and women with suspicion and fear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her family settles into the routine of running the school, Parvana, a bit to her surprise, finds herself restless and bored. She even thinks of running away. But when local men threaten the school and her family, she must draw on every ounce of bravery and resilience she possesses to survive the disaster that kills her mother, destroys the school, and puts her own life in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A riveting page-turner, Deborah Ellis&#39;s new novel is at once harrowing, inspiring and thought-provoking. And, yes, in the end, Parvana is reunited with her childhood friend, Shauzia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
