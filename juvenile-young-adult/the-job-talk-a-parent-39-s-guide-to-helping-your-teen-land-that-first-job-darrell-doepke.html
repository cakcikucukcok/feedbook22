  <title>The Job Talk: A Parent&#39;s Guide to Helping Your Teen Land That First Job - Darrell Doepke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s time for your teen to go out and land that very first part-time job. Telling them to smile, be polite and wear nice clothes is all good advice-- if they even get to the interview stage of the hiring process. The hard reality is that most of them won&#39;t get that far...and they&#39;ll never know why.   In his book, The Job Talk, author and multi-small business owner Darrell Doepke shares with you the process of recruiting and hiring new employees from a small business owner&#39;s perspective, so that you can better understand how and why hiring decisions are made, and how a first-timer like your teenaged son or daughter can gain an advantage.   Doepke uses real-world true stories to explain the process of elimination that happens long before your teen ever gets to a face-to-face interview with a decision maker. He teaches in great detail what to expect during the application and interview process-- and how to prepare for it. It&#39;s a weeding-out process, and your teen needs to know how to survive it." />

    	<p>It's time for your teen to go out and land that very first part-time job. Telling them to smile, be polite and wear nice clothes is all good advice-- if they even get to the interview stage of the hiring process. The hard reality is that most of them won't get that far...and they'll never know why. In his book, The Job Talk, author and multi-small business owner Darrell Doepke shares with you the process of recruiting and hiring new employees from a small business owner's perspective, so that you can better understand how and why hiring decisions are made, and how a first-timer like your teenaged son or daughter can gain an advantage. Doepke uses real-world true stories to explain the process of elimination that happens long before your teen ever gets to a face-to-face interview with a decision maker. He teaches in great detail what to expect during the application and interview process-- and how to prepare for it. It's a weeding-out process, and your teen needs to know how to survive it.</p>
