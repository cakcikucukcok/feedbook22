  <title>The Way Back to You - Michelle Andreani, Mindi Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For fans of Jenny Han and Morgan Matson, a witty, poignant novel about second chances, letting go, and the unbreakable bonds of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months ago, Ashlyn Montiel died in a bike accident. Her best friend, Cloudy, is keeping it together, at least on the outside. Cloudy&amp;#8217;s insides are a different story: tangled, confused, heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle is falling apart, and everyone can tell. Ashlyn was his girlfriend, and when she died, a part of him went with her. Maybe the only part he cares about anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the two people who loved Ashlyn best, Cloudy and Kyle should be able to lean on each other. But after a terrible mistake last year, they&amp;#8217;re barely speaking. So when Cloudy discovers that Ashlyn&amp;#8217;s organs were donated after her death and the Montiel family has been in touch with three of the recipients, she does something a little bit crazy and a lot out of character: she steals the letters and convinces Kyle to go on a winter break road trip with her, from Oregon to California to Arizona to Nevada. Maybe if they see the recipients&amp;#8212;the people whose lives were saved by Ashlyn&amp;#8217;s death&amp;#8212;the world will open up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it will be a huge mistake.&lt;/p&gt;" />
