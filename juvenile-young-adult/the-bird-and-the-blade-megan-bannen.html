As beautiful as she is cunning, Turandokht requires all potential suitors to solve three impossible riddles to win her hand&amp;#8212;and if they fail, they die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jinghua has kept her own counsel well, but with Khalaf&amp;#8217;s kingdom&amp;#8212;and his very life&amp;#8212;on the line, she must reconcile the hard truth of her past with her love for a boy who has no idea what she&amp;#8217;s capable of . . . even if it means losing him to the girl who&amp;#8217;d sooner take his life than his heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
