  <title>A Horse of Her Own - Annie Wedekind</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A girl who longs for her own horse is given the chance to care for a troubled, damaged horse, who needs her as much as she needs him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen-year-old Jane Ryan has always dreamed of having a horse of her own--but so long as she gets to ride her favorite school horse, Beau, at Sunny Acres farm, she&#39;s content. And this is the summer she means to try out for the advanced riding class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      But just as camp begins, Jane receives heartbreaking news about Beau. She loses, not just her favorite horse, but also her chance to ride in the end-of-summer competition. When her trainer asks for her help with an out-of-control chestnut warmblood, Lancelot, a newcomer to the barn, she has no choice but to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     There&#39;s another new addition to the farm: Ben Reyes, the grandson of the barn&#39;s manager. As Jane struggles to go on without Beau, and to make Lancelot the great horse she believes him to be, her feelings for Ben, her relationships with the privileged group of girls she rides with, and her painful, joyous road to self-discovery all lead to a heart-pounding conclusion that is truly a new beginning. Only Jane&#39;s faith in Lancelot, and her own rediscovered skill and strength, can see her through the hard journey toward a horse of her own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
