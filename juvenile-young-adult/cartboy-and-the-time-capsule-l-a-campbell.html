  <title>Cartboy and the Time Capsule - L. A. Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cartboy and the Time Capsule&lt;/i&gt; by L. A. Campbell is a laugh-out-loud debut novel for young readers about sixth-grader Hal Rifkind-unfortunately nicknamed &quot;Cartboy&quot;-and his horribly historic, hilarious year. &lt;br&gt;Hal hates history class-it literally bores him to tears. But his father is a big history buff, and unless Hal gets a good grade this year, he&#39;ll never get his own room. Sixth grade gets off to a horrible start when history teacher Mr. Tupkin gives the class an assignment to write journals that will be buried in a time capsule at the end of the year. Things get even worse when his dad makes him take his neighbor&#39;s old shopping cart to school, earning him the nickname &quot;Cartboy.&quot; What else could possibly go wrong? Read Hal&#39;s journal to find out! &lt;br&gt;Filled with photos, drawings, and timelines, Hal&#39;s time capsule journal chronicles a year in the life of the hopelessly hapless Cartboy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
