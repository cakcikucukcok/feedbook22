With only a senile grandfather he barely knows to call family, Vince was interned in a group home, dreaming that his father, whose body was never found, might one day return for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a letter arrives, telling Vince his grandfather has passed away, he is convinced that if his father is still alive, he&#39;ll find him at the funeral. He strikes out for the small town of Dyerville, carrying only one thing with him: his grandfather&#39;s journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journal tells a fantastical story of witches and giants and magic, one that can&#39;t be true. But as Vince reads on, he finds that his very real adventure may have more in common with his grandfather&#39;s than he ever could have known.&lt;/p&gt;" />
