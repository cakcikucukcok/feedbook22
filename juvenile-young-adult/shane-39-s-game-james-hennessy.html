  <title>Shane&#39;s Game - James Hennessy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Kelly is a natural athlete who lives to play Little League baseball. His new friend Shane loves animals and the ocean, but is not a &quot;cool&quot; kid, and doesn&#39;t fit into James&#39; social group. Together, the two boys learn about the importance of character, the difficulties of peer acceptance and confronting their innermost fears.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When tragedy strikes, James makes a promise to his friend Shane - a promise that takes all of his skills as a player and strength he never knew he possessed. Along the way, James finds the lessons he learned from his friend help in his efforts to deliver on his promise, and to get on with his life in the face of a tragic loss. Inspired by actual events, the story captures a young boy&#39;s love of the national pastime and the enduring power of friendship in an unforgettable championship game with an electrifying outcome.&lt;/P&gt;" />
