  <title>ALL THE WAY TO FAIRYLAND - 8 illustrated stories - Evelyn Sharp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume from Evelyn Sharp is a rare gem. Each story is delightful and each has an equally delightful illustration. Read your children a new one each night, and you will find they are the perfect stories to get them to drift off to sleep with pleasant, fairy-filled dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
The stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
I. The Country Called Nonamia&lt;br /&gt;
II. Why The Wymps Cried&lt;br /&gt;
III. The Story Of Honey And Sunny&lt;br /&gt;
IV. The Little Princess And The Poet&lt;br /&gt;
V. The Wonderful Toymaker&lt;br /&gt;
VI. The Professor Of Practical Jokes&lt;br /&gt;
VII. The Doll That Came Straight From Fairyland&lt;br /&gt;
VIII. Those Wymps Again!&lt;br /&gt;
Evelyn Sharp was as dedicated as an author as she was an historical figure, and she deserves a larger modern readership. Sharp, and maybe Dickens, were the only authors included disabilities in their writings. This, accompanied by her strong, concise storytelling (the perfect length for little minds and easily-distracted adults) and her radical life story make her one of my favorite figures from the period.&lt;br /&gt;
Sharp was a dedicated feminist during the suffragette era and refused to pay her taxes. All her belongings, including her type-writer were seized and sold to pay off her debts.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s profit will be donated to Charities.&lt;br /&gt;
