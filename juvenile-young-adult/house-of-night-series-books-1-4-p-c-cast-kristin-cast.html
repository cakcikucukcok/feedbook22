  <title>House of Night Series Books 1-4 - P. C. Cast, Kristin Cast</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dare to enter the House of Night, the phenomenal #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling young adult series from P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast, with this all new e-original collection of the first four books, including &lt;i&gt;Marked&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Betrayed&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chosen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Untamed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marked&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoey enters the House of Night, a school where, after having undergone the Change, she will train to become an adult vampire--that is, if she makes it through the Change.  Not all of those who are chosen do.  It&#39;s tough to begin a new life, away from her parents and friends, and on top of that, Zoey finds she is no average fledgling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Betrayed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fledgling vampyre Zoey Redbird has managed to settle in at the House of Night.  She&#39;s come to terms with the vast powers the vampyre goddess, Nyx, has given her, and is getting a handle on being the new Leader of the Dark Daughters. Best of all, Zoey finally feels like she belongs--like she really fits in. She actually has a boyfriend...or two. Then the unthinkable happens: Human teenagers are being killed, and all the evidence points to the House of Night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chosen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dark forces are at work at the House of Night and fledgling vampyre Zoey Redbird&#39;s adventures at the school take a mysterious turn.  Those who appear to be friends are turning out to be enemies.  And oddly enough, sworn enemies are also turning into friends.  So begins the gripping third installment of this &quot;highly addictive series&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;), in which Zoey&#39;s mettle will be tested like never before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Untamed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life sucks when your friends are pissed at you. Just ask Zoey Redbird - she&#39;s become an expert on suckiness. In one week she has gone from having three boyfriends to having none, and from having a close group of friends who trusted and supported her, to being an outcast. Speaking of friends, the only two Zoey has left are undead and unMarked. And Neferet has declared war on humans, which Zoey knows in her heart is wrong. But will anyone listen to her?&lt;/p&gt;" />
