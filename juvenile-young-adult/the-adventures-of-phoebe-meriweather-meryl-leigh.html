  <title>The Adventures of Phoebe Meriweather - Meryl Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Phoebe Meriweather is a little faeiry unaware of her own special abilities. At school, Phoebe is considered a slow learner and a bit of a late bloomer for Faeiryland. She is also shorter than her classmates; standing a mere 20 centimeters (8 inches) tall rather than the 30 centimeters (12 inches) she should be by now, in comparison to her peers. Blissfully unconcerned, Phoebe always keeps a positive attitude and a belief in her heart that she, too, will learn to fly!&lt;br /&gt;
Then, on the eve of her ninth birthday, Phoebe has a surprise visit delivered by messenger from a magical world. Suddenly, she is whisked away into an adventure of mystery and surprise, of deception and discovery, where she has to use her wits to solve the challenges she has to face to move forward. In the process, Phoebe discovers the magic in her own unique abilities." />
