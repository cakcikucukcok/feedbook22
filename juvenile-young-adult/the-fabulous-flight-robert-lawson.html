When he learns of an overseas madman who&#39;s threatening the world with a compact but powerfully destructive weapon, the 4-inch-high boy climbs on the back of a friendly seagull and heads for Europe to disarm the evil scientist &amp;#8212; and to do a little sightseeing along the way. &lt;BR&gt;Author Robert Lawson was awarded both the Newbery and Caldecott medals for his writing and illustrating, and his images for &lt;I&gt;The Fabulous Flight&lt;/I&gt; add mightily to the story&#39;s whimsical delights.&amp;nbsp;Long out of circulation, this book is back in print and ready to&amp;nbsp;delight a new generation of young readers.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
