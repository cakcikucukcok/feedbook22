  <title>The Smurfs #21 - Peyo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most dramatic Smurfs adventures ever begins with the animals fleeing the forest because of a deadly forest fire. The Smurfs attempt to extinguish the fire, but after several attempts fail, Papa Smurf makes a selfless decision to blow up the Smurf Dam. It succeeds in putting out the fire, but destroys the Smurf Village and all of Farmer Smurf&#39;s crops. The Smurfs travel north to another part of the forest to procure food, but while they&#39;re away, their nemesis, Gargamel stumbles upon the wreckage of the Smurfs Village. Gargamel concludes the Smurfs must&#39;ve relocated, and that wonders if he&#39;ll ever see the Smurfs again. But the Smurfs do return to their village and are startled to see Gargamel&#39;s footprints. As if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, the Smurfs sense they are being watched--and they are! Not by Gargamel, but by the Wild Smurf--a Smurf that was once lost and raised in the forest. How do the Smurfs possibly survive losing their homes, and losing the security of knowing that Gargamel couldn&#39;t ever find their village before, while attempting to deal with a totally uncivilized Smurf?" />
