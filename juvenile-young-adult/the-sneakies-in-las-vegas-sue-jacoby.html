  <title>The Sneakies in Las Vegas - Sue Jacoby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twelve year Coby Jay Evans; nickname Shorty should have been ready. It shouldnt have been a complete surprise. His Grandpa died of cancer. He promised to take care of Grandma. So, every night he called her. As a diversion from their grieving process he and Grandma; code name, the Sneakies planned to follow mom and dad; code name the Friendlies to Las Vegas. Grandma sounded happy when they talked about the trip. The status of the vacation changed from a fun idea to a secret mission.
While in Vegas Sneakies are watched by the Secret Service as persons of interest in a possible plot to harm the president who is in town. The Sneakies were luckier and had more fun than the Friendlies until Coby single handedly compromised their mission. How could he be so stupid? Maybe he deserved the knick-name he hated so much. A message from Grandpa gives him the courage to complete the mission. 
At the end of each chapter the reader will have an opportunity to decipher additional story Intel. The story begins and ends in small town Nebraska, features football analogies, flashbacks to Grandpas buffalo ranch, and a connection to the Middle Ages through a six inch tall silver 
knight. 
Coby Jay misses his grandfather, hates his knick name, feels belittled by his family, learns family secrets, and has the adventure of a lifetime" />
