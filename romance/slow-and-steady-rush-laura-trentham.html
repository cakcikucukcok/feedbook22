  <title>Slow and Steady Rush - Laura Trentham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;She lives by the book--and is still searching for her happily ever after.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darcy Wilde has tried hard not to live up to her last name. As a librarian in Atlanta she lives a fine life far away from the football-obsessed town of her childhood. But when her beloved Grandmother needs help, Darcy takes a leave of absence and heads back to the home and past she left behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;He knows how to play the field--and is in no rush to settle down.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robbie Dalton knows a thing or two about painful pasts. After bouncing around in foster care and the Army for years he is finally ready to move on and make a home for himself in Falcon, Alabama as the newest high school football coach. Sparks fly when the sexy new coach and the sharp-tongued librarian meet, but neither of them is looking to make ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;But when it comes to love, sometimes you&#39;ve gotta throw away the rule book to cross the finish line...&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;Everything changes when Darcy falls in love, not only with the gruff, protective, and smoking hot man who&#39;s sharing her days and nights, but also with the complex tapestry of people who weave Falcon together. Could this be where she belongs - and who she belongs with?&lt;/p&gt;" />
