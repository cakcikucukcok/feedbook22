  <title>The Mighty Quinns: Declan (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) - Kate Hoffmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;Security expert Declan Quinn knows he has a way with women. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So when he&#39;s assigned the job of guarding radio sex-pert Rachel Merrell, he figures he&#39;ll get her cooperation by charming his way into her good graces. And if she&#39;s as gorgeous as her photo, maybe her bed, too. . .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only, the lady doesn&#39;t need any persuading. . . Because of Rachel&#39;s so-called &quot;expertise,&quot; her life has become all talk and no action. And she&#39;s still managed to acquire a stalker. She needs protection—and great sex— badly! And Declan is the perfect guy to take care of both. After all, he says he won&#39;t leave her side. So what&#39;s wrong with showing him what else he could do with her body while he&#39;s guarding it?&lt;/p&gt;
