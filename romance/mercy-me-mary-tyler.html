      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jessie Mann always in the shadow of others. Never taking control in work, love or her personal life. Standing up for herself was out of the question she thought. Jessie never saw the beauty that others saw and drew them to her. Love and the zest for Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Sands walked into her life and changed everything. Making her come alive for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing her the dominate side of sex and control. But who is controlling whom? Can he make her see and feel what they could have or is it too much for both of them. Can Jessie be the one to help him with his demons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then to find out the one you called family, her BFF Sarah Canter is into a lifestyle that is dark and sensual. Can all the lies and secrets change or break their bond they shared? How accepting can you be to the deception never really knowing someone?&lt;/p&gt;" />
