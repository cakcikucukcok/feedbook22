        &lt;p&gt;Fool’s Gold Collection Part 1&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first three books and a novella in New York Times’ bestselling author Susan Mallery’s enormously popular Fool’s Gold series.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CHASING PERFECT&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Fool&#39;s Gold, California, a charming community in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. There&#39;s lots to do and plenty of people to meet, especially women. Because there&#39;s just one tiny problem in Fool&#39;s Gold: the men don&#39;t seem to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maybe it&#39;s the lure of big-city life, or maybe it&#39;s plain old bad luck, but regardless of the reason, the problem has to be fixed, fast. And Charity Jones may be just the city planner to do it. Charity&#39;s nomadic childhood has left her itching to settle down, and she immediately falls in love with all the storybook town has to offer—everything, that is, except its sexiest and most famous resident, former world-class cyclist Josh Golden.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With her long list of romantic disasters, she&#39;s not about to take a chance on another bad boy, even if everyone else thinks he&#39;s perfect just the way he is. But maybe that&#39;s just what he needs—someone who knows the value of his flaws. Someone who knows that he&#39;s just chasing perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ALMOST PERFECT&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Back in school, Liz Sutton was the girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Then she&#39;d stolen the heart of the most popular boy in town, and their secret romance helped her through the worst of times.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until Ethan Hendrix betrayed her and everything they&#39;d ever meant to each other. Devastated and pregnant, Liz left Fool&#39;s Gold, California—forever, she thought…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now Liz must return to town and face the man who doesn&#39;t know of their son&#39;s existence. And this time she won&#39;t have the option of making a quick getaway. Ethan and Liz can&#39;t deny their passionate attraction, even after all these years. But will their desire be enough to spark a second chance at love?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SISTER OF THE BRIDE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Katie McCormick finds out that her sister is marrying her ex, she finally agrees to a setup for the big day. To her surprise, Jackson is a catch. But when wedding catastrophe ensues, will their sparks fizzle or ignite into flames?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FINDING PERFECT&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Pia O&#39;Brian&#39;s best friend dies, Pia expects to inherit her cherished cat.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead, the woman leaves Pia three frozen embryos. With a disastrous track record in the romance department and the parenting skills of a hamster, Pia doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s meant for motherhood. But determined to do the right thing, Pia decides to become a single mother. Only to meet a gorgeous, sexy hunk the very same day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A former foster-care kid now rich beyond his wildest dreams, Raoul Moreno runs a camp for needy children in Fool&#39;s Gold, California. After his last relationship, Raoul thought he was done with women and commitment. Still, he can&#39;t get sweet, sexy Pia out of his mind—and proposes a crazy plan. But can such an unconventional beginning really result in the perfect ending?&lt;/p&gt;
