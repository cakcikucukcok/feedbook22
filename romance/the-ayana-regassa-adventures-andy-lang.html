  <title>The Ayana Regassa Adventures - Andy Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
The Fountain of Saba and Tokoloshe combined in one bumper edition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Fountain of Saba:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;History revealed and sacred discovery.Punishment and redemption in the ancient Kingdom of Saba.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Deep in the Ethiopian Highlands lies a secret cavern guarded by a chosen few, for it contains the object of mankind&amp;#39;s dreams and deepest desires.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A hoax and fraud.This is how many regard the letter written by the legendary Prester John, ruler of a powerful yet unexplored Christian Kingdom named Ethiopia... but one researcher and historian didn&amp;#39;t look at the letter as dupery, Ayana Regassa saw only clues that could answer one of histories greatest questions. Makeda. The Queen of Sheba; the only proof of her actual existence being written in the holy scriptures. A great queen shrouded in legend and myth. Mother to the son of King Solomon... Menelik I, the first Solomonic emperor of Ethiopia! Ayana became convinced that the letter held the key to proof, all that she needed was someone else to believe!Beyond her wildest dreams a benefactor stepped forward in the form of Hans Meisner, a terminally ill and vastly wealthy German industrialist, who commits to funding her exploration. But little does she know that Herr Meisner has his own agenda, and a deep dark secret.Teamed with Dr.James Preston, a British TV star and archaeologist, Ira Goldblum, an ageing and cantankerous Israeli professor of Ancient Languages, Helen Ross, a Wiccan specialist in Ancient Religions and all around odd-ball, plus a squad of South African mercenaries posing as security, they head into the majestic Ethiopian highlands following clues gleaned from Prester John&amp;#39;s letter.But the letter isn&amp;#39;t a hoax, and the small civilian team soon find themselves protecting sites of great historical and Biblical importance from forces driven by greed, and bent on exploitation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Fountain of Saba,&lt;/b&gt; an African adventure filled with historical fact and discovery, romance, jeopardy and danger, the super-natural,superstition, religious supposition, and for some... redemption.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tokoloshe:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Only the most powerful witchdoctor&lt;/b&gt; can call the evil, but few can send it away.The Tokoloshe, the un-dead, it will follow forever!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When you stare into the darkness and the chill of fear tingles up your spine, it is me that you sense. When you look into the crazed eyes of the dictator or the murderer, you look into my eyes. When you awake from the nightmare and thank your maker that it was only a bad dream,you have felt my presence. You may not know my name, but I have many.You have never seen me except in the horrors that haunt your subconscious.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;But I am real and I exist inside all of you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For I am the Tokoloshe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Tonga people call her Nyami Nyami, the Zambesi River Goddess. Douglas Rutherford sees her in a very different light, a last chance... bait! And it is the lure of Nyami Nyami that draws Ayana and James back into the spotlight to be reunited with South African mercenary Rolf. Action and adventure beckon as they agree to head an expedition into Zimbabwe to prove the existence of the Goddess.But unbeknown to anyone, the expedition is followed by an ancient evil, a creature from Zulu myth and legend... a creature of nightmare, a creature determined to fulfil its masters deepest desires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tokoloshe:&lt;/b&gt; An adventure that transports you from the Townships of South Africa to the humidity of the Zambesi valley, to the heart of Mozambique. A tale of superstition,forbidden love, temptation...and Evil.&lt;br /&gt;
