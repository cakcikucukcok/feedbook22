      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOVE IS ALWAYS A WILD RIDE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A writer for the &lt;i&gt;Ladies Gazette&lt;/i&gt;, Miss Ophelia Dauntry&#39;s passion is her pen. So when she sees a fellow writer kidnapped before her eyes--and the trail of evidence leads to the Lords of Anarchy--Ophelia vows to find her friend and take down the notorious London driving club in her column. But before she can argue her case, she needs the inside scoop from its newest leader: Piers Hamilton, the Duke of Trent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headstrong, handsome Trent joined the Lords of Anarchy after a decade in the British Army. He&#39;s made it his business to tame the misbehavior within the driving club--and the infuriatingly attractive Ophelia is only getting in his way. The deeper she digs into the case, the more she puts her own life at risk. Can Trent convince Ophelia to trust him to seek justice...and find protection, and passion, in his arms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t miss the last book in Manda Collins&#39; gripping Lords of Anarchy trilogy, &lt;i&gt;Good Dukes Wear Black&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;" />
