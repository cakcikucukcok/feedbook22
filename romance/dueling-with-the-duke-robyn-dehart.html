  <title>Dueling With the Duke - Robyn DeHart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;England, 1838. &lt;/i&gt;Gabriel Campbell, Duke of Lynford never intended to carry that title, but when his reckless brother gets himself killed in a duel over a woman, Gabe has no choice. Now he&#39;s sworn off love, blaming the woman that broke his brother&#39;s heart and led to his untimely death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lilith Crisp, Lady Thornton, knew from a young age that pretty girls grow up and get married off to the highest bidder. Being paraded around London as her husband&#39;s trophy has taught her some unique skills and now she can manipulate any man for his darkest secrets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabriel&#39;s position in the Brotherhood of the Sword leads him directly to Lilith&#39;s door. For Gabe, Lilith is the one woman he&#39;s always wanted, and Lilith is now forced to deal with a man who seems immune to her charms. But a secret about Lilith&#39;s niece brings them together to face a danger that threatens not only their lives, but the fate of England&#39;s Crown. Resisting Lilith is getting more and more difficult and Gabe finally recognizes that he can&#39;t keep blaming her for his brother&#39;s fate. Finding love means forgiving the past and that might be the one thing they simply can&#39;t do...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Brotherhood of the Sword series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Undercover with the Earl&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Dueling With the Duke&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Eloping With The Princess&lt;/p&gt;" />
