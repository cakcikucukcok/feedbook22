  <title>Clay&#39;s Rules - Missy Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arriving in Montana to find she&#39;s been lost in a poker game does little to calm Abbra&#39;s fears about spending two entire weeks with a bunch of cowboys. Romance author, Abbra Truelove, finds herself in a predicament when her editor offers a promotion no fan can resist. A promotion that will intentionally thrust Abbra back into rural life while she researches a book she doesn&#39;t even want to write. As if to add insult to injury, this insane promotion requires she be a house guest of the winning fan! After one too many bad experiences with rough and rowdy cowboys, Abbra is reluctant to say the least!
Clay Benson, son of Abbra&#39;s number one fan and loser of last night&#39;s poker game, begrudgingly shows up to collect his house guest, expecting to find an older, overweight, unattractive city slicker that talks too much. What he finds is a shapely, gorgeous woman with a sweet side and a past full of secrets. After Abbra steals a horse, is involved in both a shoot out and a fist fight, then goes on to show some fancy footwork following an incident with a faulty bottle of baby oil, Clay finds it necessary to impose a list of rules to keep Abbra safe. When her ex husband show up, Clay faces losing the woman he&#39;s come to realize he can&#39;t live without and discovers she needs protection from more than just her past." />
