  <title>Love Unconditionally and Live Joyfully - Qamruddin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are desperately in need of hope, enjoyment, contentment, courage, serenity, faith, peace of mind and gratitude for Almighty. To cater to that need, it has been an abundant pleasure to write this book. It will be even a greater pleasure to observe that it will be received in the same spirit, in which it has been written.
We are all busy and galloping ahead in frenzy most of the time, but there comes the quiet hour, when we must sit still and take stock of our life. There is a need to relax, pause and ponder.
I have weaved together motivational success principles in story form in this book to inspire you in day-to-day life. It is going to make an interesting reading and at the same time it will give you enough food for thought.
It is up to you whether you categorize this book, Love Unconditionally and Live Joyfully either as a fiction or a motivational book, but for me it is both. It is a motivational fiction as my earlier book, Love, Live and Leap Ahead. This book, Love Unconditionally and Live Joyfully will tell you how to put the noble ideology into practice in day-to-day mundane life.
I have intertwined the ideas in the story form in this book to generate curiosity. This is an amazing fiction, incorporating principles of success, happiness, joy and human spirituality and built on insights into unconditional love, forgiveness, gratitude, understanding, enthusiasm, hope and faith. This book is precisely and incisively written, with an unfailing strain of wit, joy and unconditional love running through these lines.
 This motivational fiction demonstrates how you can love unconditionally, live blissfully and be serene and successful in all the circumstances. This is a practical journey into your subconscious mind. Just read it for the joy of reading and let the subconscious take over and ingrain success principles and inspirational ideas into your disposition." />
