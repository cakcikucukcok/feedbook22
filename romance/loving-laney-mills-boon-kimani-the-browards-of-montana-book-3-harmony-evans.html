          &lt;em&gt;A Broward baby bump?&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A Broward–and a world-class athlete, no less–unmarried and expecting? Laney Broward is amazed she has kept her pregnancy a secret this long. Now headlines are blaring from the tabloids that she is in the family way. She can&#39;t believe that one impulsive, out-of-character night could have such &lt;em&gt;lasting&lt;/em&gt; repercussions….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The news that he&#39;s a soon-to-be father stops millionaire heartbreaker Austin Johns in his tracks. This internationally known horse breeder never planned to become a parent, but he is warming to the idea of his own family. Laney can talk all she wants about her independence; they now have a bond that cannot be broken. Austin will stop at nothing to ensure his place in his child&#39;s life–and he will not rest until he finds his way back to Laney&#39;s loving arms….&lt;/p&gt;
