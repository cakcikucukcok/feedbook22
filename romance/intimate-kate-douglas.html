  <title>Intimate - Kate Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Kate Douglas comes the first book in a sensational new series set in California wine country-a place where love is always intoxicating. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HER BEAUTY IS POWERFUL.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; They call her Kaz. She&#39;s a gorgeous model with a good head for business-until now, at least. Kaz has just been fired from her latest photo shoot for having the wrong tattoo in the wrong place at the wrong time. But a chance encounter with photographer Jake Lowell could make everything right again...if Kaz is willing to accept his proposition. What does she have to lose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIS DESIRE IS DANGEROUS. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jake has been searching for the perfect model to pose for a body-jewelry shoot-one that will leave no room for modesty. Is Kaz, who is nothing if not professional, ready to bare it all for a man she is not sure she can trust? It&#39;s an offer that&#39;s too good to refuse...and as Kaz finds herself growing more comfortable with Jake, the attraction between them reaches arousing new heights. But while the artist and his subject learn more about each other in the intimacy of wine country, evil lurks in the shadows-and soon it becomes clear that someone else has designs on &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;" />
