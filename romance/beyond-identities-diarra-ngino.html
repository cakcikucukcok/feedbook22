      <meta name="description" content="For Jessie and her best friends Angie and Monica, life is about to change, Angie finds herself in too deep with the biggest drug dealer in the area and now she has to leave Cleveland and relocate. This means leaving everything behind.
Jessie tries to help but gets side tracked for a little while when she meets Shane at a car auction and again at the mall. Things are going good until things start to crumble and secrets are revealed.
Monica is a little younger but shes been around, trying to run her shop and trying to find the right one after a not so good relationship. She has been through a lot with Angie and the fact that she has to up and leave just like that is not sitting well with her." />
