  <title>No Greater Love - Susan Rodgers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book 3 of the Drifters series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lonely man works to help the homeless on the Downtown Eastside in Vancouver &amp;acirc;?? it is his way of telling his old friend, Jessie Wheeler, that he cares about her world and what&amp;acirc;??s important to her. Meanwhile, Jessie has made a choice that reverberates around the world. Upon finding Josh - the love of her life - in a smelly garbage pile, she told him there is always hope. Now she clings to that advice herself, hoping against hope she will find her way back to him, to Josh, to the man whose chestnut hair she loves to tuck behind his ear, the man who helped her find a reason to live again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jessie&amp;acirc;??s world implodes when she must reconcile the old with the new. A dangerous stalker provides a match that fuels the flames of a tragedy, and the true meaning of sacrifice is inadvertently revealed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;- King James Bible (John 15:12-13)" />
