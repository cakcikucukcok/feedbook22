        &lt;p&gt;While his lovely green-eyed bride is out of sight, she is not far from Andrew&#39;s mind–and when Olivia is abducted by French spies, the earl fears he may lose what he&#39;s only just found. Yet the wife he races to rescue is a far cry from the gentle bride he abandoned. She&#39;s a woman who dares to demand forever after from her husband….&lt;/p&gt;
