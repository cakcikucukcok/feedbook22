His country manners are--delightful. He is unpretentious, witty, likable, discernible, and amiable. He could be confortable in the society of the lowest field worker or the Queen of England.&quot; 
At the age of fourteen, after a severe illness, Freddie experiences a spiritual vision that has given direction for his life until he meets JoAnna Fleming, the young sister of William Fleming. It is JoAnna who keeps Freddie faithful to his vision." />
