      <meta name="description" content="The Icarus is a sanctuary of sorts and a home to most of the &quot;Supes&quot; and &quot;Others&quot; in the area.  Samantha Rainwater just happens to be the daughter of the owner of the club as well as daughter to the Alpha of the Fire Rock Pack.
     With the Icarus under attack, Sam&#39;s day job as Head of Security for the Icarus is about to get a lot more interesting.  Others are being possessed and killed. It&#39;s up to her to stop it. She want&#39;s nothing more than life to go back to normal, but Fate has a different plan.
     Benjamin Roberts has come for a visit to gain some new recruits for his father&#39;s private security firm and to visit his best friend and son of the Fire Rock Pack. Ben&#39;s world is turned upside down after he meets his best friend&#39;s sister. Getting her to become his &quot;Mate&quot; becomes his number one mission. . .That is if he can keep them both alive long enough. . .Being together might just cost one of them everything." />
