  <title>The Practice Proposal - Tracy March</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nationals first baseman, Cole Collins is in trouble. He&#39;s up for contract renegotiation, but after too many late-night parties, he needs some positive publicity before he can make the roster. So when the last woman he ever expected wins a date with him at a charity auction, Cole realizes he&#39;s found his fake fiancee. She&#39;s gorgeous and smart and he&#39;s instantly hooked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liza Sutherland isn&#39;t looking for love. Especially not with a notorious playboy like Cole Collins, the guy she secretly obsessed over as an awkward teenager. When Cole&#39;s agent makes Liza a deal she can&#39;t refuse--a bet she will fall in love with Cole or a cool half mil goes to charity--the game is on. Even if it means betting against her own heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Suddenly Smitten series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 - The Practice Proposal&lt;br&gt;Book #2 - Tempted in the Tropics&lt;br&gt;Book #3 - The Marriage Match&lt;/p&gt;" />
