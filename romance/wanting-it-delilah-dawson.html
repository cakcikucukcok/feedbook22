  <title>Wanting It - Delilah Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jenna Miller&#39;s job as a florist in the small town of Thornton has kept her too busy for any intimate relationships, and she&#39;s feeling that one wild night with an even hotter man is way overdue.  So when her friend Eileen asks her to be a tester of the soon-to-be-released online matchmaking service involving anonymous sexual fantasies, Jenna is more than happy to oblige.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troy has been working hard without much time to play hard.  He&#39;s at the top of his corporate game, but feels he could use a little R&amp;R. But when Troy meets Jenna at Eileen&#39;s Orchid Soul kick-off party, everything changes and he finds he cannot forget her. So imagine his surprise when he walks into a flower shop that resides on the property he just purchased, and finds out that the unforgettable Jenna Miller is the owner of the shop. When Troy decides to remain anonymous and seizes on her &quot;Help Wanted&quot; sign to work in her shop, things get very heated. And when the Orchid Soul site leaks their sexual fantasies to each other, things go from heated to blazing hot.&lt;/p&gt;" />
