      <meta name="description" content="Late night booty calls, infidelity, and a general sense of &quot;hit it and quit it&quot; is the mentality we seem to be manifesting in today&#39;s modern dating scene, people are jaded by it.   The women who chose to brace for the worst, tend to proceed with extreme caution during the first few months of meeting someone. They don&#39;t want to fall victim of the debauchery in which many &quot;men&quot; partake in.   So it&#39;s a welcome relief when women finally stumble on these true gentlemen. These men who excrete chivalry through their smallest acts, which remind that there are still good men out there.  It&#39;s the small things that matter, the small getures, not the costly display of affection which win a girl&#39;s heart. Often times sincerity and a simple romantic gesture is all you need.  Chivalry is not dead, regardless of &quot;popular opinion&quot;  In this guide will go over the everyday chivalrous acts of men which prove this fact." />
