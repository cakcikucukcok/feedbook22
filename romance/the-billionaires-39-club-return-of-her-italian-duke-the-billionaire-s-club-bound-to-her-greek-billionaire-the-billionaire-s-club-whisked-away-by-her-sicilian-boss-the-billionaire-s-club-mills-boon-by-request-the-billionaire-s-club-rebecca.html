          &lt;strong&gt;The Billionaires’ Club&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Return of Her Italian Duke&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Gemma Rizzo applied to become pastry chef at the gorgeous Italian castello where she grew up, she never expected to get the job. But neither did she expect to find that her new boss was silver-eyed billionaire Vincenzo Gagliardi – the man who left her broken-hearted!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Bound to Her Greek Billionaire&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Lys Theron inherits a hotel in Crete, her life is changed forever! Especially as she has to share ownership with gorgeous Greek billionaire Takis Manolis. Instantly attracted to stunning Lys, Takis can see only one way to protect both his family and his reputation—make her his temporary fiancée!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Whisked Away by Her Sicilian Boss&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Princess Tuccianna Leonardi has fled from her arranged marriage and desperately needs a place to hide from her family. So, when gorgeous Sicilian billionaire Cesare Donati offers her a job as his hotel’s new pastry chef, it seems like all Tuccia’s prayers have been answered.&lt;/p&gt;
