  <title>The Masquerading Mistresses Series (Entangled Scandalous) - Robyn DeHart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No Ordinary Mistress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;London, 1814&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remington Hawthorne, Earl of Latham, has spent his life protecting the Crown. When he&#39;s assigned to play the part of lover to Emma Masterson, one of the few female spies in England and the one woman he can&#39;t forget, he&#39;ll have to risk his heart as well as his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn&#39;t easy being an independent woman, much less a spy. Perpetually tasked with proving she is as valuable as any man in her profession, the last thing Emma needs is to be reunited with the one man who makes her want to forget her duties and get lost in passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretending to be his mistress isn&#39;t difficult - remembering that it is all a charade is a challenge. With every glance, every touch, every kiss, she is drawn deeper under his spell and pulled further from her goals. She refused him once, but it will take every ounce of strength to not give in to the passion that still burns strong... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Her Spy Only&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;England, 1814&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Winifred is rescued from her snow-stranded carriage by the notorious and reclusive Alistair, Marquess of Coventry, she is instantly drawn to him. Jilted by her betrothed and socially ruined by untrue rumors, Winifred is tired of paying for crimes she didn&#39;t commit and decides to play the seductress London society claims she is. Thinking a night of passion shouldn&#39;t leave any lasting effects, she instead finds her heart marked forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years later, Alistair is working for the Regent as a spy. A search for Napoleon&#39;s English supporters leads him to the beguiling Winifred, recently widowed with a young son. He hasn&#39;t forgotten how the unconventional beauty warmed his bed, and the heat between them rekindles immediately. The spymaster is determined to uncover all of plucky Winifred&#39;s secrets. Especially the one regarding her son...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Misadventures in Seduction&lt;/b&gt; With five siblings to care for, Prudence Hixsby&#39;s duty comes first, even if it means becoming a spinster. When the eldest - and most cherished - of her younger brothers decides to join the war, however, Prudence is determined to keep him safe. So she strikes a bargain with an old acquaintance: her body in exchange for her brother&#39;s safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the dead of the night, she slips into the bed of a man whose touch is both fierce and passionate... little knowing she&#39;s just seduced the wrong man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrison Carlisle, the Duke of Sutcliffe, never imagined that the lovely Prudence would honour his bed, or just how bewitching those lush curves could be. Yet he keeps a gentleman&#39;s silence. After all, a spy for the Crown can ill afford to marry. But when Prudence&#39;s brother is killed, they find themselves uniting to track down the traitorous murderer. And while death lurks within the shadowy world of espionage, there is also passion... and the unbidden thrill of a seduction!&lt;/p&gt;" />
