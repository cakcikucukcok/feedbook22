  <title>Feeling in the Dark - Victoria Rene’e Manley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Torianey Heckstalls personal philosophy says it all. Feeling in the dark is a metaphor for how she feels when she makes the most of the decisions in her life. Life is a random cascade of experiences and opportunitiesor so she thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a whim, she decides to upgrade a ?ight shes taking to ?rst class, never daring to imagine that this one seemingly random decision would change her life in ways she could only once dream of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sitting next to her is the man who will change her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Que`Shaune Guadau II is the owner of a billion-dollar oil corporation founded by his father. But even he knows that money cant buy him everything he cravesand hes too distracted to realize that the beautiful stranger next to him in ?rst class could change his life too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Shaune and Tory made a deal with each other that will change both their lives forever. Tory was never a woman to go back on her own rules; even so, Shaunes relentlessness would soon make her question her unshakeable moral core. And he will do whatever it takes to convince her that he is the man for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither is able to abandon the sexy, ?irty, cat-and-mouse games, and this creates a problem for Shaunes best friend, Marcus Swain. Jealous and vindictive, Marcus controls a game of his own, in which the two become unwitting players. Soon, he engineers a tumultuous rift between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now its a race to see which game is the more powerfulseduction or sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
