  <title>Shannon McKenna Bundle: Ultimate Weapon, Extreme Danger, Behind Closed Doors, Hot Night, &amp; Return to Me - Shannon McKenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Ultimate   Weapon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Covert operations are what Val   Janos is all about. The man is mysterious and sinister, and lethally hot.   Only Tamara can understand the strange intensity that drives him to win at   all costs--and only she can match it.&lt;p&gt;Val has one weak spot: Imre,   the frail old man who befriended him when he was a scared, hungry kid   abandoned on the streets of Budapest. But Daddy Novak knows about Imre, and   Imre&#39;s head is on the block if Val doesn&#39;t deliver Tam up to Novak&#39;s tender   mercies...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extreme Danger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skinny-dipping in a stranger&#39;s pool--it&#39;s   as close to reckless as good girl Becca Cattrell has ever been. But the house   Becca picked for her midnight swim just changed owners. And her harmless   escapade has landed her at the mercy of a brutal, terrifying organization   who&#39;ll make sure she doesn&#39;t live to tell a soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most gorgeous woman Nick Ward has ever laid eyes on   is also the worst luck he&#39;s ever had. Becca&#39;s presence at this top-secret   meeting place won&#39;t just destroy the undercover operation he&#39;s been working   on, it&#39;s liable to get them both killed. But to his surprise, Becca isn&#39;t   running away--from the danger or from him...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Behind Closed   Doors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance expert Seth Mackey knows everything   about the women his millionaire boss Victor Lazar toys with--and tosses   aside. But Lazar&#39;s latest plaything, Raine Cameron, is different. Just looking at her triggers a white-hot passion   Seth can barely control as he watches her on a dozen   different video screens. Raine is pure temptation, but Seth can&#39;t slip up:   he&#39;s convinced Lazar had his half-brother murdered. His secret   investigation--and his life--are on the line. But then he finds out that   Raine may be Lazar&#39;s next victim...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raine knows she&#39;s   being watched--but no one can see the secrets in her heart. She has reasons   of her own to seek revenge on Victor Lazar, and she will, despite her   fear--and the distracting presence of Seth Mackey. His fiercely masculine   good looks and animal sensuality stir her most erotic fantasies when she&#39;s   alone...and lead her to a bold plan. Offering her   body to him, surrendering totally to his ruthless desire, might well push her   beyond all emotional limits--and beyond fear itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hot   Night&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby Maitland just landed a dazzling exhibit of   priceless Spanish treasure for the museum--and someone would kill for it.   Whether she likes it or not, Zan Duncan has to protect her. But Abby&#39;s   mesmerized by Zan&#39;s untamed strength and very sexual vibe. From the long dark   hair, the thick, hard muscles, and the black leather jacket right on down to   the honed fighting skills and the tattoos, Zan is a master of subtle   seduction. Then   a lethal game of deception, greed and murder gets underway--a game more   sinister than Abby and Zan ever imagined. When no one can be trusted and no   place is safe, their passion may be the only thing that can save them...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Return to Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been years since bad boy Simon Riley hopped a   freight train out of town and Ellen Kent&#39;s given up wondering what happened   to him. Running a successful bed and breakfast in Oregon doesn&#39;t leave her a   lot of time for fantasizing about midnight kisses and secret passion...until an unexpected visitor knocks on her door. She   had no idea Simon was a famous photojournalist, working in war zones around   the world. But the man is everything she wants in a lover--and more...&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogged by trouble, Simon swore he&#39;d never   return to this backwater town, even to see El Kent. But he had to investigate   his uncle&#39;s sudden death--and El&#39;s lush beauty still tempts him beyond   belief. He knows he can satisfy her most hidden desire--and he&#39;s hungry for   the sensual tenderness that only she can give.&lt;/p&gt;" />
