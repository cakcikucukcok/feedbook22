      <meta name="description" content="Is there something youve been hiding from me these past couple years? Jack asked, his words cracking.
What?
Do you have a well-kept secret?
Carrie could tell her shrill laughter spooked Jack.
She said, finally, Nope. Th is is the child who calls to me in my sleep. Ive told you about him. About a zillion times. She guided Jack into the den 
Jacks eyes bugged at the baby portrait on the easel in the middle of the room. He stumbled forward, setting his bouquet on the edge of the desk as if he didnt have the strength to hold it another second.
Carrie air-kissed the portrait of the cherubic child and introduced him to Jack. Sweetie, meet my former boyfriend. Weve only recently parted ways. You see, Im making way for you, and he, well, hes making way for himself. Carrie stopped, lest Jack think she was berserk and call 911.
Jack stared at her for what seemed an eternity before whispering, Darlin, I know youve got this maternal instinct going, but this, its too much.
No, Jack. Its not enough. It wont be enough until this child is in my arms and in my life.
