Posing as an infamous madam in New Orleans, Zahra must gather information to ensure the safety of the South&#39;s freedmen. The last thing she expected was to see Archer Le Veq again. He is as arrogant as he is handsome, but there is something about this dusky and debonair hotelier that sends her senses singing. Zahra knows she will need to guard her secrets, but no peril awaiting her compares with the treachery of Zahra&#39;s own heart&amp;#8212;for, Lord help her, she burns to taste the man and to lose herself in his powerful embrace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
