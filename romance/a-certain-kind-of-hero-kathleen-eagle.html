  <title>A Certain Kind of Hero - Kathleen Eagle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two bad boys find redemption when they become unlikely heroes to two very special women and their families.  Don&#39;t miss these romantic favorites from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Kathleen Eagle!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gideon Defender understood hard choices. Innocent and pure, Raina McKenny had deserved someone better than him, so he&#39;d stepped aside and watched her marry his brother. He&#39;d stayed away when they adopted a baby and created the perfect life he could never offer her. Now, fifteen years later, Raina had returned to the reservation a widow with her fatherless teenage son in tow, and Gideon faced the toughest choices of his life. Between desire and duty, between condemnation and trust, between fatherhood and honor&amp;#133;and even between life and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broomstick Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amy Becker needed a man. Tate Harrison wouldn&#39;t have been her first choice&amp;#133;but then, her first choice had gone and died, leaving her pregnant, broke and on the verge of losing everything. Surprisingly, Tate was a good father figure to her children, a tireless worker and far too tempting during those long winter nights. But Tate wasn&#39;t one for roots; he was hers only until spring. Unless she could convince him to stay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
