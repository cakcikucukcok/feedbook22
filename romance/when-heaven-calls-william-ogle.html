&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two soul mates in heaven on a beach. The young couple reached the shore. They both removed their sandals and began to stroll barefooted at the waters edge. Diana reached over and took Freds hand. He smiled. Diana and Fred were in love. They promised to find each other, to share their love and their lives on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina, the departure station operator, said, It is time for you to leave, Fred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred asked, What about Diana?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diana will leave shortly after you, dont worry, Tina reassured him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred opened the door. He turned for one last look at Diana. Remember, you are my soul mate. Fred walked through the doorway, disappearing into the gray mist &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding on to her husbands hand, Sheila screamed as she pushed even harder. Tims fingers grew dark red as Sheila pushed the final time. You can relax now. You did a great job, Dr. Jones replied. You have a beautiful little boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred and Diane pass by each other many times in life, without knowing they were meant for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Fred proposed to Sue, his high school sweetheart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Fred and Diane ever meet? Will they ever be soul mates on earth? The story shows us that when our faith is weak, God is always there to help us through our struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
