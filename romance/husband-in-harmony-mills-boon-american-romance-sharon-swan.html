          &lt;strong&gt;Mixing Business And Pleasure– Or Just Getting Mixed Up?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Adam Lassiter is one of the top men in his field, a consultant who specializes in turning around unsuccessful businesses. He&#39;s married to his job, which explains why he&#39;s now divorced and why he needs to put some major time and effort into winning back his eight-year-old son&#39;s affection. Adam has a plan to get closer to the boy: a combined business and vacation trip to a run-down campground in the mountains above Harmony, Arizona, to see if he can salvage the campground–and his relationship with his little boy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But after a few hours at Glory Ridge with Jane Pitt, the owner–plain Jane, as she calls herself–Adam realizes he&#39;s out of his depth. In more ways than one…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jane is, too, of course. And neither of them knows what to do with their powerful attraction to the other!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Harmony&lt;/strong&gt;
