  <title>One Fucking Favor - Bull Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nineteen-year-old Mateo is asked by his mother to deliver a cream pie her potential suitor down the street. When a shootout occurs, Mateo is caged in the man&amp;rsquo;s house and forced into submission.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Be straight with me, kid. Is your mom doing this just to be neighborly or is she doing this to get my attention?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mateo could&amp;rsquo;ve ratted out Moms, but he knew that Mr. Oscar knew what was up brandishing a stupid grin. Instead, Mateo announced, &amp;ldquo;Let me say this: There aren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of men over the age of thirty living in this neighborhood, so when one moves in, everyone with a ten block radius definitely takes notice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Oscar laughed. &amp;ldquo;I bet they do. Too bad there all young enough to be my daughter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How old are you?&amp;rdquo; Mateo asked abruptly, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; see the man being a day older than forty-five and even then that was a generous stretch given with the premature strains of gray and white sprinkled in his face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Aren&amp;rsquo;t you forgetting something, young man?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sir,&amp;rdquo; Mateo guessed, not accustomed to using the word that often.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good. You got some manners. To answer your question, I&amp;rsquo;m sixty-one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mateo was short letting out a cuss looking at the handsome man when his ears were flooded out by the rattling of a barrage of bullets a couple of houses over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mateo stayed low on the ground, making his way over to the burglar-barred window as his elder, Mr. Oscar, walked over to it unfazed by the gunfire glory. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard for him to see it was a rival gang doing a drive-by shooting at the parked cars as some of the local street gang members attempted to fire back at the speeding vehicles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Oscar laughed, looking down at Mateo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s so fucking funny, hommes?&amp;rdquo; Mateo asked letting his dormant Mexican accent override his typical American dialect. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re shooting to kill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nothing, man,&amp;rdquo; Mr. Oscar offered, as one of the cars in the middle of the street opted to have an in-depth shootout with one of the parked cars. &amp;ldquo;When you showed up on my doorstep, I sort of pegged you for one of those boys that got around on their knees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mateo wanted to get up and fight for his honor, but as he tried to get up and confront the old man, he lost his balance and accidentally grabbed a chunk of Mr. Oscar&amp;rsquo;s sturdy thighs, which he quickly let go of.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Needy, too,&amp;rdquo; Mr. Oscar laughed some more." />
