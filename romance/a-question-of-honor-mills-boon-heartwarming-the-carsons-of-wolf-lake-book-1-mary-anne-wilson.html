  <title>A Question Of Honor (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) (The Carsons of Wolf Lake, Book 1) - Mary Anne Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Trusting him is easy. Telling him is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Faith Sizemore needs to disappear. And Wolf Lake, New Mexico, seems as good a place as any. Just to hole up for a few days and rest her road-weary nerves before making her way to Colorado…and then…who knows? Her only destination is away. As far away from Chicago as she can get.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But lying low in Wolf Lake is impossible. She’s attracting too much attention. Particularly from Detective Adam Carson, the best-looking son of the town’s most prominent family. The kind of man she could imagine a life with, if hers weren’t such chaos. The kind of man who could turn her in…if she doesn’t get out soon!&lt;/p&gt;
