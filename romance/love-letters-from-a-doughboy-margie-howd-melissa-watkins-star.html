      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thomas Fletcher first sees her in 1916, at a drug store in Birmingham, Alabama. He doesnt know her, but her brown hair and beautiful eyes captivate him. He soon learns her nameJuliette Wilcoxand she would learn his.

&lt;p&gt;Thomas is a drafted soldier, about to be sent to Europe to fight in the dreaded World War I. Although Juliette begs for them to be married before he goes to boot camp, he doesnt want to leave her a widow. Their letters will keep them close. Letters are all they will have until he returns from the battlefieldhopefully, alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next four years, letters arrive from far off France and Germany to Juliettes front porch in Alabama. For the next four years, their love grows, develops, and increases. Even so, war is a dark force, and many men never return. Will Thomas be one of the soldiers lost, or will he come home and make Juliettes dreams of marriage a happy reality?&lt;/p&gt;" />
