  <title>Elk Hunter&#39;s Romance Jet Rover Style - Clyde G. Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two people are married, perfect in every way; when one is stricken by cancer and eventual death. But the wonderful man wants his wife to be happy.  An already strained marriage is tremendously hard on an actively sexual woman.  In her sexual loneliness she turns to another man to fill the emptiness in her heart.&lt;p&gt;
One day on Rover 1 she meets Jerry.  She instantly likes what she sees, not knowing that Jerry had broken marriages; and was starved for a loving relationship.  Destiny had brought these two together, and that night under the stars, they&#39;re both overcome by their lonely passion.  In those three days some bonds are formed.  By the time Jerry finds out that Max is married, it&#39;s too late; he already loves her. Max finally tells Jerry her wonderful husband Frank is dying of cancer.  Jerry and Max have a lot in common, being hunters. Max invites Jerry on a hunt in Durango, Colorado, also offers him a job as a guide, because she wants to see him again. They exchange phone numbers, and their parting is quite sad.  Although they communicate, the year goes by and Jerry goes on the hunt.  The two have more sexual encounters; by now they are deeply in love, and within two months the husband dies.  Jerry flies out to comfort her, not knowing Frank had a lawyer draw up a partnership for Jerry to be a 50% partner with Max and wanted them to marry.  Both Max and Jerry were shocked he knew about the relationship." />
