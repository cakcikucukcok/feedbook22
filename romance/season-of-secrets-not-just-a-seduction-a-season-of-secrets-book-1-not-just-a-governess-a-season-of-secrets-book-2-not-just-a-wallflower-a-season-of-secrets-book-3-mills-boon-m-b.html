          &lt;strong&gt;Not Just a Seduction (A Season of Secrets, Book 1)&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Earl of Chambourne’s scandalous reputation has been well-earned, but he has never forgotten the only woman he has ever loved—nor forgiven her for marrying another man while he was off fighting in France.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Christian discovers she is a widow, he hungers to possess her once again—as his mistress. Lady Sylviana Moorland, Countess of Ampthill, knows it is only a matter of time before she comes face to face with Christian again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No longer an innocent, she sees no reason not to take the sensual pleasure he offers. But can Sylvie resist falling for the seductive rake?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Not Just a Governess (A Season of Secrets, Book 2)&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Darkly delicious Lord Adam Hawthorne doesn’t care a whit for society – especially the tedium of finding a wife. So taking on a new governess for his young daughter shouldn’t shake his steely disposition! Or lady in disguise?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except Mrs Elena Leighton, an enigmatic widow, is a most intriguing addition to the household. What are those ladylike airs and graces beneath her dowdy exterior? Despite great impropriety, Lord Hawthorne is compelled to discover the real Elena – no matter what secrets are unveiled along the way…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Not Just a Wallflower (A Season of Secrets, Book 3)&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enigmatic beauty Ellie Rosewood is the talk of the ton. Her appointed guardian, Justin, Duke of Royston, has one job – to find Miss Rosewood a husband. But confirmed rake Justin wants Ellie all for himself!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With her coming out a huge success, Ellie is overwhelmed by the attention of London’s most eligible bachelors. She finds an unexpected haven in the company of the arrogant Justin, and he begins to discover there is more to this unworldly wallflower than first appears…&lt;/p&gt;
