  <title>Make Me Lose Control - Christie Ridgway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="USA TODAY bestselling author Christie Ridgway returns to Blue Arrow Lake with the dazzling story of opposites attracting in the rustic mountains of California.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;As live-in tutor to a headstrong teen, Shay Walker has her hands full&amp;#151;and the girl&#39;s absentee father doesn&#39;t help matters, either. All Shay wants is to let loose and indulge in a birthday fling with the hottest stranger who&#39;s ever caught her eye. But her one-night stand turns out to be Jace Jennings, her student&#39;s long-distance dad&amp;#133;and now he&#39;s taking up residence&amp;#151;at his lakeside estate and in Shay&#39;s most secret fantasies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Jace isn&#39;t exactly a family man, but he&#39;s determined to do his best by his daughter&amp;#151;and the first step is forgetting how hot he is for her teacher. But close proximity and their heated connection keeps Shay at the forefront of his mind&amp;#151;even as it&#39;s obvious she holds her heart in check. So does Jace. Until they both realize that losing control just might mean finding forever." />
