      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Supernatural Assignments opens our eyes to the fact that we are God&amp;rsquo;s representatives on earth and as believers, each and every one of us have a job to do in the kingdom. Once you understand your calling, your gifts or purpose His goodness, mercy, and favor will walk you through life day by day to do His work. Mr. Yalley continues to use His gifts of seeing visions and dreams to touch lives to the glory of God. He teaches us how important it is to be sensitive in our spirit to know when to act, to pray or simply keep quiet. God is a timely God but a God of many chances because of His unconditional love for us, but we can still miss God for what He is doing through us at a particular moment if we are not sensitive in our spirit and to be able to walk in obedience. Let Mr. Yalley lead you through his Supernatural Assignments and allow his walk with God minister to you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
