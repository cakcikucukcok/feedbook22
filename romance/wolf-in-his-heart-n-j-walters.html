  <title>Wolf in his Heart - N.J. Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Half-breed werewolf Sage Gallagher can&#39;t shift, but he&#39;s a member of the Salvation Pack and a wolf where it counts. When he finds who he thinks is a lost hiker while camping in the Great Smoky Mountains, he&#39;s surprised to find she&#39;s a full-blooded wolf who ignites in him the instinct to take her home to where he and his pack can protect her, no matter how skeptical and untrusting she is of his offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Rina rejects her parents&#39; choice for a mate, she&#39;s exiled from her pack. That&#39;s a dangerous position for any wolf to be in, and now she has a human hunter on her trail. Rina doesn&#39;t trust easily, especially not half-breeds--who she was raised to fear and revile. But there&#39;s something about Sage that calls to her. Soon Rina&#39;s in more danger than ever--danger of losing her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Salvation Pack series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Wolf at the Door&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Wolf in her Bed&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Wolf on the Run&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Wolf from the Past&lt;br&gt;Book #5 Wolf on the Hunt&lt;br&gt;Book #6 Wolf on a Mission&lt;br&gt;Book #7 Wolf in his Heart&lt;/p&gt;" />
