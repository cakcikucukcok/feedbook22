So even though the jet-setting photographer with the high-voltage smile was the most captivating guy she&#39;d ever met, she refused to think of him as anything more than a fling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyler Nichols was addicted to adventure. So at first he was relieved that the cynical law clerk with the cool blue eyes didn&#39;t expect him to stick around for long. But that was before he realized that being with Kate was a thrill he wasn&#39;t getting tired of. Now their future depended on him getting back to her on time from his most dangerous assignment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He just better not be late for their Christmas date!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
