  <title>Salt - Danielle Ellison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Penelope is a witch, part of a secret society protecting humans from demon attacks. But when she was a child, a demon killed her parents--and stole her magic. Since then, she&#39;s been pretending to be something she&#39;s not, using her sister&#39;s magic to hide her own loss and prevent being sent away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she&#39;s finally given the chance to join the elite demon-hunting force, Penelope thinks that will finally change. With her sister&#39;s help, she can squeeze through the tests and get access to the information she needs to find &quot;her&quot; demon. To take back what was stolen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets Carter. He&#39;s cute, smart, and she can borrow his magic, too. He knows her secret--but he also has one of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Penelope&#39;s impossible quest becomes far more complicated. Because Carter&#39;s not telling her everything, and it&#39;s starting to seem like the demons have their own agenda...and they&#39;re far too interested in her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
