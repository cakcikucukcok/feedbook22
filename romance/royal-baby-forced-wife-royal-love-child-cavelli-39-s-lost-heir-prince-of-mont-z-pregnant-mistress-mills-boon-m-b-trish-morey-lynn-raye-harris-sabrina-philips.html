  <title>Royal Baby: Forced Wife, Royal Love-Child / Cavelli&#39;s Lost Heir / Prince of Montéz, Pregnant Mistress (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Trish Morey, Lynn Raye Harris, Sabrina Philips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Prince demands an heir… and what he wants, he gets! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sienna Wainwright had one phenomenal night with Rafe Lombardi before he cast her out of his bed. But six weeks later their world changed… No longer just a billionaire, Rafe is revealed as the Prince of Montvelatte. Sienna is pregnant – with his twins!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prince Nico Cavelli would never normally waste his time visiting the prison cell of a tourist. Except this particular alleged criminal, Lily Morgan, has stolen something very personal to him – his son, heir to the Montebianco throne! Cally Greenway was hoping to secure the job of restoring some valuable paintings, until they’re sold to the Prince of Montez!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then Cally gets a royal summons – his Majesty has a job for her… as his mistress: biddable, pleasurable…and pregnant? Let us treat you like a queen – relax and enjoy three glamorous, passionate stories about privileged royal life, love affairs…and scandalous pregnancies!&lt;/p&gt;
