Too bad her dad made her promise to graduate high school first. Silver lining? Her new school has a serious talent competition with a $25,000 cash prize, which would go a long way in L.A. Jenna&#39;s got plenty of talent--she didn&#39;t almost win America&#39;s Newest Sensation for nothing. But it&#39;ll take everything she&#39;s got to bring down the music nerd with a stick up his butt...no matter how cute he is in those glasses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miles Cleveland needs to win that talent contest. When some hot girl stole his audition spot on America&#39;s Newest Sensation, his chance to study music flounced off to New York with her. Now, not only can he win enough money to pay for his education, he can get revenge on that very same girl. He can&#39;t start to question his plan, though...no matter how deep Jenna buries into his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the A Before Forever series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 The Summer Before Forever&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Falling for Forever&lt;/p&gt;" />
