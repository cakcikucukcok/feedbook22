  <title>The Savvy Sistahs - Brenda Jackson, Monique Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amber, Carla and Brandy---known as the &quot;ABCs&quot;---are intelligent businesswomen who met in their business support group &quot;The Savvy Sistahs Who Mean Business&quot; and became the best of friends.  They&#39;ve bonded over lost loves, past hurts, and too many lonely nights. . . &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amber Stuart escaped an abusive marriage and now finds peace running her small bookstore.  But when a man passes out in her establishment, after eating one of her homemade cookies, she&#39;ll do anything to avoid a lawsuit, even if it means going into his home and nursing this fine brother back to health.  What she doesn&#39;t know is that this brother is about to turn her life upside down; Raising a two-year-old son on her own and running the computer business she inherited from her father, Carla Osborne doesn&#39;t have time for anything else.  Then she finds herself the object of a hostile takeover.  And it turns out that she&#39;s fighting to save her company from the man she had a one-night stand with all those years ago---the man who happens to be her son&#39;s father; After a divorce settlement leaves her the sole owner of the St. Laurent Hotel, Brandy Bennett decides to manage her new business full-time.  When she finds herself the object of a deranged stalker her family convinces her to bring in a security expert to help.  Enter ex-FBI agent, Grey Masters---and with him a whole lot of drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is dishing it out hard, but these ladies are determined to hold on to each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
