  <title>The Princess Sisters - A. Russell Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1860, and Robert Knight is praying. Destined to take over a struggling West Texas ranch, Robert has his work cut out for him. Despite knowing that his new ranch is vulnerable to Mexican rustlers and that a neighbor already despises him and his Christian values, Robert still holds one goal above all others: to find a wifeand quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Robert settles into life on the ranch, he intently watches from horseback one day as the first train full of dignitaries pulls into Haggard, Texas. All seems normal until he suddenly sees three hoodlums approach the train and drag a woman out against her will. Robert initiates a fierce gun battle where he eventually emerges the victor. After he takes the woman to the safety of his ranch, Robert soon realizes that he has not rescued just any woman. He has saved Elizabeth Abdullah from the claws of a radical group who want her dead. Unbeknownst to Robert, Elizabeth is facing an enormous duty: to marry a prince and become the mother of the next male regent of the island of Donoscia-este.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this historical tale, a future princess and her two sisters somehow find their lives intertwined with a young, adventurous West Texas cattle rancher who must rely on his faithand Gods wisdomto help him lead everyone in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;
