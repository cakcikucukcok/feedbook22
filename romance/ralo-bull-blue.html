  <title>Ralo - Bull Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After Fatback collects Ralo&amp;rsquo;s submissive plaything as his sole property, Ralo is left to make do with his nineteen-year-old cellmate Bert. When his lover and fellow cellmate Alistair cuts a deal with Fatback, Ralo is handsomely rewarded with a familiar plaything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are those two motherfuckers going at it again?&amp;rdquo; Ralo, my agitated cellmate asked of the growing snickers coming from the neighboring cell. He was up, bare ass and all, performing his late night ritual of pissing directly into the chrome toilet. His liquid serenade ended with a loud snort that always stirred me out of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I rolled over onto my side catching the lonely light coming from the open air corridor watching him pump away at his burgeoning erection. He should&amp;rsquo;ve derived pleasure from the act, but it soon became apparent that his body longed for another, our neighbor Ahmad. Ralo had once been a third to their twosome, when Fatback, an enraged Buddha-like character, thought it would be best to keep his prize Arabian to himself. And it didn&amp;rsquo;t help matters there was only a thin wall the separated the lovers and the spare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Catcalls began to congregate as Ahmad and Fatback turned their foreplay of laughter into heaving grunts and exaggerated yelps. Ralo, still detached from pleasure, began pumping violently to their rhythm when I startled him from mid-stroke by saying, &amp;ldquo;Let it go.&amp;rdquo;" />
