  <title>Waltz with a Stranger - Pamela Sherwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;May I have this dance?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Aurelia wasn&#39;t hiding exactly. She just needed to get out of the crush of the ballroom—away from the people staring at her scar, pitying her limp. She was still quite enjoying the music from the conservatory. And then a complete stranger—dashing, debonair, kind—asked her to waltz. In the strength of his arms, she felt she could do anything. But both would be leaving London soon...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When they meet again a year later, everything has changed. She&#39;s no longer a timid mouse. And he&#39;s now a titled gentleman—with a fiancée. Is the magic of one stolen moment, one undeniable connection enough to overcome a scandal that would set Society ablaze and tear their families apart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;May I have this dance?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Aurelia wasn&#39;t hiding exactly.
