  <title>Dove - M.H. Salter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Japhy would sacrifice his freedom for people he will never meet. Ray would sacrifice all those unknown people just to protect him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1970, when Japhy receives his draft notice for the Vietnam War, he and girlfriend, Ray, become Dharma Bums. They pack their lives into a duffel bag, and hitch their way to the Canadian border &amp;ndash; a safety zone that, once a draft dodger enters, he can never leave. Ever. Not to see family. Not to help injured friends. Not even to attend a loved-one&amp;rsquo;s funeral.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the road, Japhy and Ray are joined by flower children, Leaf and Lauren, and all four decide to find a hippie commune in Toronto where they will be free of their demons, and safe with their secrets. Or will they?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amidst a colorful whirl of psychedelics, love-ins, original music, and political protests, Japhy and his friends discover everything has a price, freedom is not free, and true peace comes at a cost whether you are fighting for it in a war or simply within the depths of your own soul.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How far would you go for freedom?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dove&lt;/em&gt; is the first book in &lt;em&gt;The Freedom Series&lt;/em&gt; and was shortlisted for the &lt;em&gt;Impress Prize For New Writers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a companion to this novel, a soundtrack of original songs by James Lee Stanley is available.&lt;/p&gt;" />
