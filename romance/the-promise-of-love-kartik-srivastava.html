  <title>The Promise of Love - Kartik Srivastava</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is loving with all your heart and soul enough? How far would you go to keep the promise of love alive?
Love stories never die. Love lives forever. Some love stories have a very beautiful end. Some remains incomplete, yet they stay forever young and beautiful.
The Promise of Love: Kept Alive is one of those stories that are beautiful but could not find a perfect end. It is an immature, young, and sensitive love story of two teenagers, Kavya and Mishti. They both found each other in a coaching institute and fell in love. They both were bound  by the destiny to fall in love, but it lead them to a road where they had take sturdy decisions and had to act mature than their ages.
It is a breathtaking tale that teaches us the various aspects of lovebeing loving, being caring, being gentle, and being kind towards each other. But sometimes, all this is not enough. Sometimes love is beyond these facets and is bound by certain promises.
 Is that all? Is this the same story of love? They didnt know what fate had planned for them. Unaware of the fact, they can run from the cruelty of fate, but cannot escape from it.
This heartwrenching story of the two lovers is the tale of The Promise of Love: Kept Alive." />
