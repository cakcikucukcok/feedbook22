  <title>Two Faces of Beauty - William Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection of micro didactics is dissimilar to all collections that have come before it. It is the product of competing in two college literary contests and the taking of a writing course. The contests were at Lamar State College in Beaumont Texas and Eastfield College in Mesquite Texas. Also a writing course offered by the Long Ridge Writers Group.
These were the reasons these works were created, but what of the sources? Its sources are as diverse as random chance will allow. They are life experiences that have merged with the learning experiences in the bizarre imagination of the author and tempered with elements from deep within. 
Two Faces of Beauty may well be called a multigenre work, but still major differences exist with this work. Not just being microdidactic, that is, the most possible information and instructions compressed into the fewest possible words, but the common threads that run through the entire book from work to work regardless of the genre.
No matter, short story, essay, autobiographical, or poetry, the threads are there, the threads of duality, justice, poetic or otherwise, and truth. This truth transcends mere research, though research is critical in any story, fiction or nonfiction. I speak here of truth reflected by the world in which we live.
These works are wide-ranging and will take the reader from the mountaintops of the human experience to the depths of despair with many stops in between the two." />
