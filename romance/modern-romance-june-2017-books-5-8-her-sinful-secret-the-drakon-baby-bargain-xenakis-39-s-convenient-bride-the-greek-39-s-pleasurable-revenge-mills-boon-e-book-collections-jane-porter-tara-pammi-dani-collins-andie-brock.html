        &lt;h2&gt;Four stories filled with sizzling chemistry!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her Sinful Secret&lt;/em&gt; by Jane Porter&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The secret she never told…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her heart racing, Logan Copeland cannot look away from tycoon Rowan Argyros as he declares that her life is in danger. All she can think is that Rowan took her virginity, heartlessly rejected her after a night of reckless abandon…and is the father of her child. She must reveal the truth before she’s whisked away to Rowan’s castle for safety…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Isolated with Rowan, Logan finds herself at the mercy of his unrelenting need to claim her—and their daughter! She has known no touch but his, and yearns to feel it again…but to do so she must agree to meet him at the altar!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drakon Baby Bargain&lt;/em&gt; by Tara Pammi&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A deal sealed with passion!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Illegitimate and overlooked, Eleni, Princess of Drakon, yearns for a family. And at a masquerade ball one stolen kiss with a stranger sparks an opportunity! Gabriel Marquez wants her to care for his child—could this be Eleni’s chance to strike a deal of her own?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gabriel, Drakon’s biggest investor, is shocked by Eleni’s bold bargaining…but a convenient marriage would be advantageous to them both! He’ll gain a stand-in mother for his daughter, and Eleni will have the baby she longs for. Except Gabriel hasn’t predicted the fire raging between them…one which will bind them together for ever!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xenakis&#39;s Convenient Bride&lt;/em&gt; by Dani Collins&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The challenge: two weeks without your billionaire fortune!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Greek magnate Stavros Xenakis must go undercover to win a bet – and escape his grandfather’s demands that he take a bride. Until encountering deliciously tempting housekeeper Calli proves that a convenient wife is exactly what he needs!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Calli’s baby being taken away robbed her of the ability to trust anyone. But Stavros’s offer to marry her gives her the chance to finally find her son. But Calli doesn’t expect for their honeymoon to be so sinfully sensual – and for life as the temporary Mrs Xenakis to be so exquisitely satisfying…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Greek&#39;s Pleasurable Revenge&lt;/em&gt; by Andie Brock&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Revenge…by seduction!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The last person Calista expects – or wants – to see at her father’s graveside is arrogant billionaire Lukas Kalanos. Five years earlier, after an affair that stole her innocence, Lukas betrayed her family and disappeared, leaving Callie with much more than a broken heart…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seeking vengeance on the Gianopoulous family for framing him, Lukas finds Callie ripe for his seduction. She will pay for past wrongdoings – between his sheets! But discovering that Callie has had his child is a surprise that changes Lukas pleasurable plans of revenge…into a hunger to make her his own!&lt;/p&gt;
