  <title>Mister Officer Trilogy (Interracial Erotic Romance Bundle) - Jenna Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leah lives a mundane life in a flameless marriage. Right when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her, a big black officer decides to help in more ways than one. This trilogy pulls together Mister Officer, Double Duty and Police Misconduct in one hot interracial bundle that can&#39;t be put down!
Mister Officer
Leah is a lonely housewife waiting for her husband to come back from yet another business trip. She&#39;s been suspcious of his activities for quite some time however she&#39;s never had any proof. As she lies in bed feeling frustrated, she decides to use her favorite toy to get her out of her unhappy mood. As she turns it on, she realizes that its been broken from the last time she used it.
She heads out to towards the nearest novelty store and buys a new one. Unfortunately for her, she gets pulled over by a big black police officer while she&#39;s busy contemplating about her husband. The officer let&#39;s her know of the fact that she ran a stop sign and her car is over tinted. The day seems to be getting worst for Leah when her newly bought toy falls out of the passenger side compartment while she reaches for her registration papers.
The surprised officer takes note and offers her a way out of the ticket. Leah&#39;s surprised at first but once she sees what the big black man has to offer, she starts to have second thoughts. Does Leah take the offer from the kind, big black muscular officer?
Double Duty
Leah&#39;s constantly having flashbacks of the big black cop who pulled her over and gave her quite the ride. As she begins to crave his presence again, her husband&#39;s phone rings. He has a very important meeting he has to go to, yet again. Even though she is suspicious of her husband&#39;s activities, she has no proof and sighs as her husband heads off to work.
As she sits at home, bored, there&#39;s a knock at the door. She looks out the peephole to see the big black officer that pulled her over. Her heart races as she opens the door and sees him... along with another black cop. The two enter her home and gives her an up close and personal visit. Can Leah handle the double duty?
Police Misconduct
After an amazing experience with Officers Jones and Black, Leah waits to hear back regarding their tailing of her husband. She hopes that her suspicions were wrong and that her husband is faithful to her. She&#39;s stunned when Officers Jones and Black come by her house with three other black Officers and her husband in cuffs.
Officers Jones and Black take her to her kitchen and show her pictures and text messages from her husband to a close friend of her&#39;s, proving that he&#39;s been cheating on her for well over a year. Leah is devestated and confused as to what to do next. Officer Jones has a suggestion, humiliate her husband Chris.
As her confusion turns to pure anger and rage, she agrees. Officers Jones and Black take her back to the living room where her husband is hand cuffed to a chair. With him bound, she looks at the five big black cops, lust within her eyes. She&#39;s about to give her cheating husband a lesson in revenge while getting a huge amount of pleasure while she&#39;s at it...
