  <title>Healing the Widower&#39;s Heart (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) - Susan Anne Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A Child&#39;s Only Hope &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When widower Nathan Porter brings his grieving son, Zach, to Wyndermere House&#39;s camp, he is desperate for a lifeline. Nathan&#39;s hoping the change of scenery to the woods of upstate New York will help mend his son&#39;s heart. But the counselor assigned to his son&#39;s care seems too young–and too pretty–to be qualified. Paige McFarlane&#39;s learned what loving someone–and losing them–costs. But soon her efforts with Zach reveal that to help the son she must also help the dad. As Nathan and Paige work together to mend the boy&#39;s broken spirit, they realize the walls around their own hearts could be crumbling, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
