          &lt;strong&gt;Will You Marry Me? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bold widow Johanna Yoder stuns Roland Byler when she asks him to be her husband. To Johanna, it seems very sensible that they marry. She has two children, he has a son. Why shouldn&#39;t their families become one? But the widower has never forgotten his long-ago love for her, until his foolish mistake split them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This could be a fresh start for both of them. Until she reveals she wants a marriage of convenience only. It&#39;s up to Roland to woo the stubborn Johanna and convince her to accept him as her groom in her home and in her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Hannah&#39;s Daughters: Seeking love, family and faith in Amish country.&lt;/em&gt;
