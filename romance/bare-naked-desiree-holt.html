  <title>Bare Naked - Desiree Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Georgie Zielinski has invested everything she owns in a dilapidated B&amp;B in Saddle Wells, Texas. She doesn&#39;t have anything left over to hire someone to help her get the place back to its former glory, so when a rough-around-the-edges cowboy offers his handyman services, she listens to her gut and takes him on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cade Hannigan was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but it&#39;s long since tarnished, and he&#39;s a down-on-his-luck cowboy if there ever was one. All he has now is his beat-up truck and a reputation so bad no one will hire him. Luckily for Cade, newcomer Georgie doesn&#39;t know anything about the man he used to be, and she accepts his help in exchange for room and board. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they work together on the old B&amp;B, they start to build a tenuous friendship that soon explodes into wild passion. But not everyone is ready to give Cade a second chance, and their newfound happiness could disappear like smoke.&lt;/p&gt;" />
