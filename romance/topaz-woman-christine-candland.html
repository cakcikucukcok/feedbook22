  <title>Topaz Woman - Christine Candland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s 1975 and Cassidy Brookes is stuck in a dead-end job at a Hollywood movie studio. A testy encounter with A-list director Jeff McConnell provokes her into dusting off her ambitions to become a writer. Taunted by McConnell, Cassie decides to write a screenplay to show him what she can do-but she is at a loss for a story.&lt;/P&gt;
While shopping at an antiques fair, Cassie buys a jeweled brooch containing a rare Imperial Topaz. She learns the brooch was once owned by a mysterious red-haired woman who lived in Ouro Preto, a fabled eighteenth-century city in Brazil, known for its Topaz mines and rivers of gold. As Cassie fingers the brooch, she feels a powerful connection to the red-haired woman, who lived half a century before. So great is her obsession with the story, Cassie quits her job and abandons McConnell, with whom she is falling in love.&lt;/P&gt;
After traveling to Brazil, Cassie arrives in Ouro Preto to track down the clues which lead to Amanda Savage. A child of two continents and a jazz-age rebel, Amanda proved to be a formidable activist in her day, as she challenged the aristocracy and their treatment of the local miners.&lt;/P&gt;
Amanda&#39;s courage blossoms in Cassie who is driven to solve the riddle of Amanda&#39;s death and bring the legendary tale of the &lt;I&gt;Topaz Woman&lt;/I&gt; to light. How Cassie writes the story of Amanda Savage, battles the studio and Jeff McConnell, brings this romantic adventure to its exciting conclusion.&lt;/P&gt;" />
