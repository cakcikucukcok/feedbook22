  <title>Sweet Cowboy Christmas - Candis Terry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mistletoe, holly, and cowboys, oh my! Christmas in Texas has never been sweeter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Chase Morgan traded in his dusty cowboy boots for the shimmering lights of New York City and a fast track up the corporate ladder. But when his shiny life is turned on end just in time for Christmas, Chase knows he needs to reevaluate&amp;#8212;even if that means going home to Texas to endure his least favorite holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mr. Tall, Dark, and Smoking-Hot walks through her door at the Magic Box Guest Ranch, Faith Walker sees just another handsome, rich exec looking to play cowboy for a week&amp;#8212;at her expense. She&amp;#39;s sure the grumpy-but-sexy-as-hell Scrooge will put a crimp in her holly jolly plans. Until a sizzling kiss has her seeing him in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase is haunted by secrets, and even though it goes entirely against her &amp;#34;hands off the guests&amp;#34; rule, Faith is tempted to help him leave the past behind. As the magic of the season swirls around them, she is determined to succeed, because now she is certain one sweet cowboy Christmas will never be enough.&lt;/p&gt;" />
