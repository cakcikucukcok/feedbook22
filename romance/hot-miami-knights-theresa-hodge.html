  <title>Hot Miami Knights - Theresa Hodge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Serenity Champagne is a woman known to overindulge in delectable treats. She now has an appetite for not only one, but two, delicious vanilla lattes. Her sweetest fantasies threaten to end her year of celibacy, and she is doing everything she can to be strong. When she gets a taste of Jonathan Knight, her resolve is undone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan, Jon for short, is a tall, malted milkshake that stands roughly six foot three inches tall. He&amp;#39;s handsome with close-cropped, silky, wavy hair and his skin tone is the color of pale butternut squash. He has the type of hair that makes Serenity crave to run her fingers through each and every strand. He has his eye on the sweet temptress, vowing to own her in every way. But Jon is not the only one that has his sights on this sexy vixen...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Jason... Jonathan&amp;rsquo;s identical twin brother. Jason&amp;#39;s features resemble his brother&amp;rsquo;s in every way, with the exception that Jason sports long, golden dreadlocks. His eyes are deadlocked on Serenity&amp;#39;s entrancing beauty and he wants her for himself. He is a playboy, unlike Jonathan, but he wants what he wants. With both of the highly sought-after Knight brothers set on making her theirs, will Serenity choose one brother to love and live in happiness or will her overindulgence of decadent desserts cause her to satisfy her sweet tooth with both pieces of vanilla chocolate at once?&lt;/p&gt;" />
