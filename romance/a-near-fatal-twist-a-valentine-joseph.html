  <title>A Near Fatal Twist - A.Valentine Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Darnel knows he is treading in dangerous waters, but he doesnt care. From the moment he first sees Keri, a beautiful new assistant, he is intrigued. She is smart, sexy, and alluringly elegant. Darnel must be careful, or they might both get burned. But she is too irresistible, and he throws caution to the wind. Their love is pure and sweet, and everything seemed kissed by destiny.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Laura is a striking beauty, a dark-skinned temptress in high heels. Her beauty is only skin-deep, however, and her brilliant smile masks the darkness of her soul all too well. From a distance, she looks like a sophisticated lady, but thats just her disguise. Up close, shes nothing but trouble, and now she has set her sights on destroying Keri and Darnels happiness.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Laura launches a meticulously planned assault on the couple, and they must now use every skill they have to save themselves. Unable to prevent disaster, Keri watches helplessly as her life begins to spiral down into the abyss Laura has created for her.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Can love truly conquer all in time to save her lifelet alone her relationship?&lt;/p&gt;" />
