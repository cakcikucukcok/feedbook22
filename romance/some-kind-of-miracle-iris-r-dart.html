  <title>Some Kind of Miracle - Iris R. Dart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the mega-bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Beaches&lt;/em&gt;, a new novel, available in mass market for the first time, once again celebrating female relationships. Two very different women fulfil a childhood promise to take care of one another no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dahlia Green is a struggling songwriter in Los Angeles who has fallen on hard times. She&#39;s had few of her songs recorded, but lately there&#39;s been a long pause between sales and she&#39;s starting to believe she&#39;ll never sell another song. &lt;br /&gt;As a child Dahlia and her cousin Annie wrote duets together as child play. Then Annie was diagnosed with schizophrenia and for all of her adult life has cycled in and out of mental hospitals where no one ever goes to visit her. Now twenty-five years later Dahlia has a chance to shine again by selling a song she and Annie wrote. So she tracks Annie in an institution and brings her home in hopes of convincing her to sign away her rights to the tune. But what starts out as a scheme to get ahead and exploit her cousin results in Dahlia putting someone else&#39;s needs above her own for the first time in her life. She fulfils a childhood promise made long ago to take care of one another no matter what. &lt;/p&gt;" />
