  <title>Molly’S White Rock House - Bobby Beddoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the late 1870s, orphans Benjamin and Molly are finally old enough to strike out on their own. Leaving behind the life they knew in Dry Ridge, Kentucky, the siblings head for Texas, a new territory where Benjamin has been ordered to undergo advanced training for the Second United States Army Dragoons. But along the way, hardship strikes when one of the axles on their Conestoga wagon fails just outside of Marble Falls, Texas. Deciding to seek shelter for the night, the pair comes across an abandoned white rock house and agree to stay there until they can get on the road again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, they meet Joe Eagle, a local Indian boy who saves Molly from a rattlesnake. The three quickly become friends, and Molly soon discovers that she has feelings for Joe. When the siblings decide to stay in Marble Falls and make enough money to buy the white rock house, Joe begins to wonder if Molly truly cares for him or if the white rock house is her only love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the distance grows between them, Molly and Joe must find a way to either put aside their feelings for each other or find a way to start a new life together at the white rock house.&lt;/p&gt;" />
