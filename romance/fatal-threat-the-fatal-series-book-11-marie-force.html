  <title>Fatal Threat (The Fatal Series, Book 11) - Marie Force</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;With a killer on the loose, it&#39;s the worst time to be on lockdown…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s just another day at the office for Washington Metro Police lieutenant Sam Holland when a body surfaces off the shores of the Anacostia River. But before Sam can sink her teeth into the new case, Secret Service agents seize her from the crime scene. A threat has been made against her family, but nobody will tell her anything - including the whereabouts of her husband, Vice President Nick Cappuano.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t the first time the couple&#39;s lives have been at risk, but when a bombshell from Sam&#39;s past returns to haunt her, she can&#39;t help but wonder if there&#39;s a connection. With a ruthless killer out for vengeance, and Nick struggling to maintain his reputation after secrets from his own past are revealed, Sam works to tie the threat to a murder that can&#39;t possibly be a coincidence. And she has to get it done before her husband&#39;s career is irrevocably damaged…&lt;/p&gt;
