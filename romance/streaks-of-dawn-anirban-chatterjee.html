  <title>Streaks of Dawn - Anirban Chatterjee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marriages are made in heavens&lt;br /&gt;
Eight years into his marriage, Ayan found that his intimacy with his wife Hiya had somehow sundered and he was scarcely involved with her romantically anymore. His distance with his wife was on ever increasing yawning graph. Divisive politics at work left him miserable, until he reconnected with his childhood love, Jahnavi, through text messages, after fifteen long years. Their friendship withstood pillars of time and she had filled a definite void in his life. He did not even realize when he had began a steamy affair with another woman, Snehal, the wife of his old friend Rajeev. Snehal was willing to fight the orthodox hypocrites of Indian society to leave her husband for a life with Ayan. What would Ayan do? Would he leave Hiya and marry Snehal or would seek solace in Jahnavi or he would return back to Hiya and begin life anew?&lt;/p&gt;" />
