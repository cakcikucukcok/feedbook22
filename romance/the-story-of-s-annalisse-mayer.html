  <title>The Story of S. - Annalisse Mayer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if..?
&lt;p&gt;
After the death of JFK, Jr., the press was flooded with mesmerizing pictures of him, not to mention some rather lurid tabloid articles.  The author found herself drawn into repeated, obsessive fantasies of what knowing him or having a romance with him might have been like.  
&lt;P&gt;
Ultimately, she found herself writing down one of her fantasies as a novel. 
&lt;P&gt;
She changed the names to make clear that this is entirely a work of fiction, her own fantasies, not actually about the real people who inspired her writing.  She wove in her own life experiences: her son&#39;s Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, home birth, and information from a suicide prevention course.  She also could not resist drawing in some pet political issues, for instance regarding abortion, pesticide spraying, and drug legalization.
&lt;P&gt;
The result is an eminently readable romance and psychological study, which should enthrall any woman of a certain age who fantasizes about younger celebrities or anyone who is interested in Asperger&#39;s Syndrome." />
