  <title>A Kiss of Cabernet - Pamela Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Napa Valley vineyard manager Paige Reynoso is furious. After a six-year absence, her boss--big-city entrepreneur Jake Madison--has returned, only to announce he&#39;s selling the vineyard. Paige has always dreamed of buying Garnet Hill, which sits on land where her ancestors first settled, but without the cash, she&#39;s out of luck. And then there&#39;s an even bigger problem...she has a serious thing for the surprisingly tempting man who&#39;s just destroyed her dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake&#39;s in a tight spot. With his other business ventures struggling, he needs cash--&lt;i&gt;fast&lt;/i&gt;. The last thing he needs is the too-lovely Paige convincing him the grapes are an effective long-term investment. Or needing Paige herself, whose spirit and heart bring his to life. But as their attraction grows, Jake knows he&#39;s not in a position to offer her anything beyond this moment. Because Jake has a big secret...and it has nothing to do with sour grapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Love in Wine Country series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 A Kiss of Cabernet&lt;br&gt;Book #2 A Touch of Chardonnay&lt;/p&gt;" />
