        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d forgotten her past and found her future&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Adrienne Winston woke up in the hospital, she found she was missing the past three years of her life. Married and pregnant, Adrienne was forced to trust Sam Donnelly, the stranger who was her husband. While she didn&#39;t remember his face, her body recognized his touch and memories of their shared passion lingered. But Adrienne was a woman in trouble. She had the evidence to put a man in jail…and no idea where she had hidden it. She needed Sam&#39;s help to uncover her past before it caught up with her–and destroyed the family she wanted desperately to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
