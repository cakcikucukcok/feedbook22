  <title>Not Quite A Pimp - R. Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Jason is approached by some neighbor girls who have nude photo problems. Jason refuses to steal the photos, until the girls bribe him with pussy. Jason gets the photos and then creates duplicates, with the girls masked and spread. Jason&amp;rsquo;s sister then helps with the filming and other things. Veronica then has a Daddy problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I find myself an island of calm in the middle of a storm, created by several bat shit crazy neighbor girls. My twin sister and I turned 18-years-old and graduated from high school. My sister and I live in a house, mostly paid for by my hard working, struggling Mom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I studied math and science in high school and I have a job that earns me a little money. I bought a little birthday cake and Sis, Mom and I had a birthday party, with candles and all. We then discussed the immediate future, but without a clear path to success.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have a job, installing security systems in commercial buildings. I mainly work Saturday and Sunday, since our security system installations are to be secret and also not interfere with the normal operations of the businesses that are our customers. I normally work about 20 hours a week, but I earn a high wage, for a 20-year-old high school graduate, due to my high skill work. Sis works at some sort of ladies&amp;rsquo; boutique, after school and Saturday, and makes just about minimum wage. Mom works for a large company and works in a new location each week. Mom is gone almost all of each week, except Saturday and Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sis and I each attend a local junior college.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I get home, after school, one day and I find myself confronted by Alice and Bobbi, two bat shit crazy neighbor girls. It turns out that the two girls each attend a local private college. They each have a scholarship, to pay for the expensive school. The scholarships are dependent on maintaining grades and also proper behavior. It turns out that several of the neighbor girls got high on drugs and posed for really nasty nudie photos. If the school finds out about the in the nude photos, bye bye scholarships. The girls are desperate, but they have a plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alice lectures me, &amp;ldquo;We got high and had the photos taken by the lecher who runs the local photography studio. He is now threatening to turn the photos over to the college. We have to get the photos back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I ask, &amp;ldquo;How does this involve me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alice explains, &amp;ldquo;The photographer&amp;rsquo;s studio is located on Pine street, downtown. You worked on installing a security system, for several of the businesses in the area including the photographer&amp;rsquo;s studio. You can probably get into the photographer&amp;rsquo;s studio, late at night. Then one of us can get the photos back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I lecture the girls, &amp;ldquo;I did, indeed, work on installing the security system in the photographer&amp;rsquo;s studio. I can get into the photographer&amp;rsquo;s studio, undetected, late on a Friday night. I can&amp;rsquo;t take anyone in with me. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s think about what happens. I&amp;rsquo;m inside the photographer&amp;rsquo;s studio. The photographer has some nasty nudie photos of you girls. The photos are likely locked away somewhere. How do I get the photos?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alice says, &amp;ldquo;The photos are locked in a cabinet. The cabinet has a combination lock. One of the girls worked in the photographer&amp;rsquo;s studio, which is how we got into this mess, in the first place. We have the combination for the cabinet lock.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
