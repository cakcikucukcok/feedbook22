Stunningly beautiful, utterly tempting, she&amp;#39;s also a bag of wedding night nerves, so Nicholas decides to wait to do his duty&amp;#8212;even if it means heading to the boxing saloon every day to punch away his frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groomed her whole life to become the perfect duchess, Isabella longs for independence, a dream that is gone forever. As her husband, Nicholas can do whatever he likes&amp;#8212;but, to Isabella&amp;#39;s surprise, the notorious rake instead begins a gentle seduction that is melting every inch of her reserve, night by night . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his utter shock, Nicholas discovers that no previous exploits were half as pleasurable as wooing his own wife. But has the realm&amp;#39;s most disreputable duke found the one woman who can bring him to his knees&amp;#8212; and leave him there?&lt;/p&gt;" />
