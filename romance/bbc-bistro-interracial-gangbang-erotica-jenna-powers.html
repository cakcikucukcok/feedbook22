  <title>BBC Bistro (Interracial Gangbang Erotica) - Jenna Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amy and Sam are owners of the BBC Bistro. Their customers are dwindling and their staff is fired faster than they&#39;re hired! Amy doesn&#39;t seem to care as long as the kitchen continues to run the way she wants it to. When Jamal, Jerry and Marcus visit after watching the couple on a reality show, they&#39;re surprised to see that the show wasn&#39;t staged.
Three girls are immediately fired and Jamal takes this as a chance to get himself, as well as his two friends hired. Being new in town, any job works with them. When the three big black men start work, they&#39;re more and more stunned by the actions of the owners and eventually learn that they won&#39;t even be paid any tips.
As the three argue with Amy and Sam, the escalation causes the staff to quietly close shop and leave. The three big black men easily keep Sam at bay as they learn that he doesn&#39;t want to call the cops; most likely because he&#39;s hiding something. The three decide to negotiate and there&#39;s only one thing Amy can provide that they want, and it&#39;s not her cooking...
