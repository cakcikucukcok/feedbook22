  <title>Tempted By the Night - Elizabeth Boyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Secret Admirer . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say he&#39;s a shameless rake who cares for nothing but pleasure, a rogue who spends his nights in London&#39;s lustiest locales, gambling and carousing until dawn. But Lady Hermione Marlowe refuses to believe that the handsome gentleman she&#39;s loved from afar for so long could be so wicked. If only she had a way to prove to the &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; that Lord Rockhurst is as proper as the rest. If only she knew what he really did under cover of the night . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Clandestine Encounter . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Rockhurst knows what they say about him, and he doesn&#39;t care. Let them think his nights are filled with craven debauchery. Only he knows his true purpose, his dangerous goal. But when a mysterious woman falls into his arms&amp;#8212;and thereby saves his life&amp;#8212;Rockhurst will struggle to save his secret. Who is this creature with such tempting curves and an enticing touch? Rockhurst can only wonder how he can trust her . . . for he knows he cannot resist her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
