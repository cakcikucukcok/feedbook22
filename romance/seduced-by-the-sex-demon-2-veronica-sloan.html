  <title>Seduced by the Sex Demon 2 - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Jeffrey Corven used to be a spineless sap of a man, until his wife summoned a sex demon and turned him into a force of nature! Now devilishly horny and with the power to control the minds of men and women, Jeff is on a quest to screw everyone he can get his hands on. This bawdy tale of blasphemy is as humorous as it is hardcore!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
He drifted into a pleasant post-feeding nap for only a few minutes before Tanya knocked on the window.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He blinked awake and smiled at her, then unbuckled his seatbelt and exited the car. She crossed her arms and stood by the garage door. &amp;quot;What did you do?&amp;quot; she said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do? Is something wrong?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Ryan&amp;#39;s girlfriend is perfectly fine. Better than, I&amp;#39;d say. She&amp;#39;s glowing. What did you do?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A gentleman never kisses and tells, my lovely step-daughter.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t call me that. I&amp;#39;m not your...I don&amp;#39;t know what you are, but you&amp;#39;re not Jeff.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What would you like to be?&amp;quot; he asked. He pinned her up against the garage door. His front pushed into hers until her soft breasts molded against his chest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His mouth opened hers and he reached down to cup her buttocks and raise her leg up to hook over his hip. He pushed with his already growing erection into her crotch and they grinded for a moment into the garage door. Tanya&amp;#39;s tongue tasted Melanie&amp;#39;s pussy, sweat and blood and she moaned into his mouth as his cock began to massage her clitoris. She pulled away, off him, off the garage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You fucked her,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I fuck everything,&amp;quot; said Jeff. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what I do. And I also smell. I smell what you want.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;After the initial seduction the magic doesn&amp;#39;t work as well on its own. You&amp;#39;re welcome to blame my pheromones for your desire, but that&amp;#39;s not everything.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; she said guardedly. &amp;quot;I just came out here to tell you to stay away from the girl. From everyone.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a little too late for that,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But we&amp;#39;re only staying for one more night.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re not doing anything,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to find a way to...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He loomed over her. &amp;quot;To what? Send me back to Hell?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The breath left her body. &amp;quot;Is...is that what you are? My mother once said that magic was...you can&amp;#39;t be-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shrugged. &amp;quot;I am that I am. You&amp;#39;re welcome to try to expel me from the heart of Jeffrey Corven - it&amp;#39;s been a wonderful vacation thus far. But while you&amp;#39;re in the mood to torture me, perhaps we can adjourn to the bedroom?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pressed her against the hot hood of the car. The shock stung through her shorts and she cried out. His mouth captured her own and they began to kiss, she fighting it, even as her hands clawed at his shoulders and stayed there. He gripped her thighs fiercely and opened her up, held her against the hot engine-&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She bit his lip hard. &amp;quot;You fucking monster...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You like fucking a monster,&amp;quot; he said. He bit back and pushed his erection into her middle. She groaned aloud. &amp;quot;You like that I fucked your cousin, you like that I fucked your mother and your grandmother-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You what?&amp;quot; Tanya gasped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not a man and I don&amp;#39;t have to play by the rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You are a man,&amp;quot; she grunted and rolled her crotch into his cock. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what you are but you&amp;#39;re definitely a man.&amp;quot;" />
