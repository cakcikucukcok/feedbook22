She&#39;ll do anything to uncover the dirt on the famous radio personality but when she finally uncovers a secret that could destroy Ross&#39;s reputation, she faces losing her job or losing the fairy-tale ending she didn&#39;t even know she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cinderella Makeover&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chic fashion photographer Francesca St. James agrees to work as a &quot;fashion fairy godmother&quot; on a new reality TV show, but she doesn&#39;t agree to falling for one of the contestants. Tech company CEO Greg just needs some help transforming himself enough to find his happily ever after, and butting heads with his high-and-mighty fairy godmother isn&#39;t in his plan. The two couldn&#39;t be more different, but as Greg transforms into the smoking-hot, confident guy he was always meant to be, will his makeover find him his one true love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cinderella Seduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four months ago, Nick&#39;s bachelor-style life was turned upside down. Now the sole parent to a seven-year-old daughter he never knew existed, Nick doesn&#39;t have time for pleasure. But he hadn&#39;t factored in Stefanie or the intense attraction he&#39;d feel for her. As her seduction heats up, so do the stakes, both professionally and romantically. Can he let business go long enough to allow Stefanie into his heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
