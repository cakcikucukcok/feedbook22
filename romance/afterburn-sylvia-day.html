        &lt;p&gt;#1 New York Times bestselling author Sylvia Day, America&#39;s premier author of provocative fiction, delivers the debut novel from Cosmo Red-Hot Reads from Mills &amp; Boon. The realization that Jax still affected me so strongly was a jagged pill to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He’d only been part of my life for five short weeks two years ago. But now he was back. Walking into a deal I’d worked hard to close. And God, he was magnificent. His eyes were a brown so dark they were nearly black. Thickly lashed, they were relentless in their intensity. Had I really thought they were soft and warm? There was nothing soft about Jackson Rutledge. He was a hard and jaded man, cut from a ruthless cloth. In that moment I understood how badly I wanted to unravel the mystery of Jax. Bad enough that I didn’t mind how much it was going to cost me… Look for 2 new eBooks from Cosmo Red-Hot Reads from Mills &amp; Boon every month.&lt;/p&gt;
