      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing is just the beginning...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A saucy Christmas novella to heat up your winter nights!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ness is looking forward to hanging out in Brooklyn with her girlfriends over Christmas, while also deciding what to do with her life, and getting over her split with Jay the jerk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  She&#39;s not thrilled then, when her mum tells her that she&#39;s bought her a ticket to England to spend some time with her dad in the countryside. Spending the festive period with a bunch of sheep and cows is not Ness&#39;s idea of a good time.  And though her arrival does nothing to change that, she soon has a major distraction in the form of Dominic Dumont, whose parents own the massive stately home where her dad is caretaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Despite being upper class, arrogant, selfish and reckless, Dominic soon starts to work his charm and Ness begins to find it difficult to ignore him.
