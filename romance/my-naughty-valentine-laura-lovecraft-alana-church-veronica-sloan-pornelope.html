~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gaelic Goddess&lt;br /&gt;
No one grieved for Mick Phelan when he died. The old lawyer had been a terrible father and a horrible man, poisoning his children with his hate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But an unexpected inheritance was waiting for his grandson Thomas. An Irish goddess who Mick had ensnared decades ago showed up on his doorstep, begging him to free her from bondage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now Tom and Rhiannon must navigate a treacherous road. Will their growing attraction for one another allow them to part the mists of time and release her from slavery? Or will Rhiannon be bound forever, a fate worse than death for this Gaelic Goddess?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Girl Fight&lt;br /&gt;
Four lives. Innumerable secrets. A tragedy that binds them all...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;- Sara: A survivor of longtime sexual abuse, she is a girl with a shattered past who has, since childhood, fought for her life. Literally.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;- Tanya: The most invisible girl in school, she cuts to ease the pain of her life. And things are only getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;- Antonio: A man with a heart just as massive as his libido, he is trapped in a relationship built on unrequited love; a fact that is slowly breaking his heart and driving him insane.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;- Fatima: A girl hellbent on revenge. Though popular and social, she is slowly decaying over the secrets that she holds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tragedy brought them together, lust makes them inseparable, and love just might be the only thing that can save their lives...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Destiny&amp;#39;s Desire&lt;br /&gt;
Destiny has every reason to hate menher mother is the infamous pornstar Serena Siren, and she despises every part of her mother&amp;#39;s flamboyant lifestyle. But all that changes when a gorgeous injured man stumbles on her remote cabin in the middle of a violent storm, and Destiny must care for him. Passion flares between them, and intrigue crumbles her resistance when she catches him masturbating. Now she&amp;#39;s determined to learn the truth about sex, starting with a hot anal reaming that will rock her entire world!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One Weekend With My Best Friend&amp;#39;s Father&lt;br /&gt;
Lindsey&amp;#39;s always had a crush on Richard, the kind and dashing widower who lives next door. Of course, Richard also happens to be her best friend&amp;#39;s father... The two of them have always been flirtatious, but when an accident on a hiking trip compels them to share a sleeping bag, they can&amp;#39;t keep their hands off each other!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#39;s What Friends Are For&lt;br /&gt;
When he was younger, Justin promised his mother he would be nothing like his womanizing cheat of a father. Part of that promise included waiting to lose his virginity until he met the right girl. Now 18, Justin is finally going to have his first time! His mother is going away for the weekend, and his hot blonde girlfriend, Jen, promises she is going to come over and spend the weekend with him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Things are looking good for Justin except that his best friend, tomboy Samantha, doesn&amp;#39;t trust Jen, and thinks Justin is making a mistake. &amp;quot;Sam&amp;quot; turns out to be right when Justin finds out Jen has been sleeping around on him, and he&amp;#39;s heartbroken and frustrated. But he won&amp;#39;t be for long, because Sam says she is on her way to cheer him up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she arrives, Justin is surprised to find his normally plain friend beautiful and dressed to kill. The surprise continues when Sam tells him that she would be happy to be his first lover. After all, won&amp;#39;t best friends do anything for each other?" />
