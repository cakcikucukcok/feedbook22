  <title>A Family For Jana (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) - Eileen Berger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Between struggling to balance school and parenthood, Jana Jenson&#39;s hands were full. The single mother was not in the market for romance–especially after experiencing the heartache of having her son&#39;s father abandon her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Still, Jana was grateful for the support of the Sylvan Falls community, particularly the kindness of handsome college professor Ray Hawkins….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although a painful lesson from the past had taught Ray to guard his heart, he couldn&#39;t get Jana off his mind. He wanted to shower her with affection and favor her son with the fatherly attention he&#39;d missed. With the ready-made family by his side, he could imagine happily-ever-after was possible. But could he and Jana find strength from above to heal their hurts and face their pasts when their newfound happiness was threatened?&lt;/p&gt;
