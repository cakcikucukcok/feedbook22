        &lt;p&gt;Reunited–down under. Natasha Beale was horrified when her tour guide turned out to be Tom Scanlon–the man who&#39;d jilted her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She would be spending the next two weeks alone with him, in the wilds of the Australian Outback. She still felt hurt and betrayed, yet she would need him to protect her, day and night. It was too intimate a situation for estranged lovers–Tom had set it all up. Tom had also changed: he was fitter, more muscular–ten times sexier! He wanted her back. And he had a secret to tell: the real reason why he&#39;d left her.&lt;/p&gt;
