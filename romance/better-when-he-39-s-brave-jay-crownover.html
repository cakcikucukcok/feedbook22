She has a lot to repent for and saving the city, plus the hot cop that she hasn&amp;#8217;t been able to forget might just be the only way she can finally find some inner peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an entire city poised on the brink of war, Titus and Reeve stand in the crossfire&amp;#8212;and it will take two brave souls to fight for the ultimate love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
