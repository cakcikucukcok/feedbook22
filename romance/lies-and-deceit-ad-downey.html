  <title>Lies and Deceit - Ad Downey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A successful R&amp;B diva must do whatever it takes to keep it all together
when her life is turned upside down with blackmail attempts, family
confl ct, and an impatient suitor.
As far as their neighbors and fans know, the Dunnigans are a loving and supportive
family. Malissa Dunnigan, a.k.a. Lady D, is at the top of her game. An established
star in the R&amp;B industry, shes a household name with wealth, awards, and success.
But despite everything shes gained and earned, something is still missing in her
fairytale life.
On the day she meets Antonio Jackson, a handsome and wealthy bachelor with hazel
eyes and a shaky past, Lady D dares to dream of even more. But will the specter of a
past love get in the way of her future with Antonio? After two years, her world begins
to turn upside down, and shes powerless to stop it. Someones blackmailing her, shes
constantly fighting with her brothers (which is nothing new), and now Antonio is
pressuring her about marriage. Malissa cant help but drag her feet, and her resolve
is further complicated by secrets shes kept from her fans, her family, and Antonio.
As the curtain closes and the spotlight disappears, there is another story to be told
and this performing family is about to learn that the truth will do anything but set
them free. When Malissas parents, Clinton and Vera, receive a threatening note,
Vera gathers her family to strategize. Despite years of conflict that theyve somehow
kept within the family, can the Dunnigans pull together to save everything they love?
Or will Malissas secrets cause it all to come crashing down around them?" />
