  <title>Just Deserts (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (The Three Mrs. Fosters, Book 3) - Brenda Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Learning that her estranged husband has passed away is the biggest shock of Danielle Timberlake-Foster&#39;s life–until she learns that she wasn&#39;t his only wife. Though Danielle and Marc were separated, she believed they were about to reconcile and start a family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rocked by betrayal, Danielle sees her dreams slipping away. Until her brother&#39;s best friend, Tristan Adams, offers support, comfort–and a chance to have the child she&#39;s always wanted. Danielle is drawn to Tristan&#39;s strong, sensual nature, but she wed Marc in haste and regretted it. Is she about to repeat her mistake? Or will a marriage of convenience turn into the soulful union she&#39;s always longed for?&lt;/p&gt;
