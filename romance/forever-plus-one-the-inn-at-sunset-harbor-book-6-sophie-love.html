  <title>Forever, Plus One (The Inn at Sunset Harbor—Book 6) - Sophie Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“Sophie Love&#39;s ability to impart magic to her readers is exquisitely wrought in powerfully evocative phrases and descriptions….This is the perfect romance or beach read, with a difference: its enthusiasm and beautiful descriptions offer an unexpected attention to the complexity of not just evolving love, but evolving psyches. It&#39;s a delightful recommendation for romance readers looking for a touch more complexity from their romance reads.”&lt;p&gt;--Midwest Book Review (Diane Donovan re For Now and Forever)&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FOREVER, PLUS ONE is book #6 in the bestselling romance series The Inn at Sunset Harbor, which begins with book #1, For Now and Forever—a free download!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;35 year old Emily Mitchell is still reeling from the surprise news that she is pregnant. Just married, she and Danielle have no time to process the news as they are thrust into doctor appointments, preparing for the baby’s arrival—and, in a surprise party, the revelation of their baby’s gender.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer has finally returned to Sunset Harbor, and Emily and Daniel have their hands full with the overflowing inn, their gut renovation of Trevor’s house, the building of a new spa, and Chantelle’s reacting to the baby news. They barely have time to settle into life as newlyweds when Emily gets a call from her dad: he wants them all to visit him in England. Surprising herself, Emily agrees.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life-changing trip to England culminates in shocking news, and Emily finds herself reeling. Daniel withdraws, and as summer comes to a close and her pregnancy develops, she wonders: will she ever be able to settle into this new life?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And will life with Daniel ever be the same again?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOREVER, PLUS ONE is book #6 in a dazzling new romance series that will make you laugh, cry, keep you turning pages late into the night—and make you fall in love with romance all over again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book #7 will be available soon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A very well written novel, describing the struggle of a woman (Emily) to find her true identity. The author did an amazing job with the creation of the characters and her description of the environment. The romance is there, but not overdosed. Kudos to the author for this amazing start of a series that promises to be very entertaining.”&lt;p&gt;--Books and Movies Reviews, Roberto Mattos (re For Now and Forever)" />
