  <title>Royally Courted - C.S. Nolan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Past&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France, 1640. In a French coastal village during the Thirty Years War, Altheia de Savoir waits for her Scottish sailor love, Matthew, to return from the sea. But when marauders descend upon her village, Altheia barely escapes with her life. Matthew rescues her and takes her to Ireland, where she will be safe with his family. Though Matthew wishes to officially wed his lady love, he must honor his military obligations and return to Scotland.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then the unthinkable happens. Matthew is captured and left alone to die innocently in a dark and frozen Scottish dungeon, unable to communicate to Altheia. But Altheia and Matthews love story is far from over &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern California, present day. After she is summoned to jury duty, Collette Peters encounters Matthew McDonnell, a handsome and successful criminal defense attorney. The trial inspires her to become a forensic DNA investigator; a few years later, she meets Matthew again when his legal defense team contracts her to complete an investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working together, Collette and Matthew find they share an intense attraction, but they are unaware of why they are so strangely drawn to each other. When they begin to piece together the clues, they realize the answer lies in the past and may very well lead to the love of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
