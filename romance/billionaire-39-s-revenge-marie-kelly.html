  <title>Billionaire&#39;s Revenge - Marie Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Six years ago the task of firing Darius Larosa had fallen on Sara.  Now he is back, and hell bent on revenge.  The Company he just took over is in turmoil with Sara&#39;s sister facing prison as an accomplice to her absconded husband&#39;s fraud.  Darius however, wants revenge on Sara, not Angela so he makes her a deal - her in his bed or her sister in prison.  With little choice Sara moves in with the billionaire, but she has plenty of secrets, one of those being what really happened six year&#39;s ago.  Will Darius finally have his revenge on the youngest Balfour daughter, or will he find that perhaps his assumptions are not as clear cut as he first thought." />
