  <title>Daydreams of a Country Boy - Thomas McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mike was a country boy with a dream. He wanted a car, a job, and
a girlfriend. He got the car and a job, but the girlfriend turned
into a nightmare. Mike finally got a girlfriend, but the school
bully put him down. His girlfriend left him. So he decided not to
get mad, but to get even. The way he got even was a blast. Mike was
going to a country school. You had to have a car or ~ou were dead in
the water with the girls. Mikes luck turned bad. If he didn&#39;t
have bad luck, he wouldn&#39;t have any luck at all. After a bad storm
destroyed their home, they moved to a small town. Mike ran with the
guys and got in a lot of trouble. He finally made out with a girl.
Turned out she was a fifty dollar a &quot;night call girl from Houston
and showed him the ropes about making love. Mike made out with other
girls after that. Then Mike met Linda Carson.
Linda was a rich rancher&#39;s daughter. They moved from Oklahoma to Texas
and bought a large horse ranch. Mr. Carson hired Mike after he saved
his horse&#39;s life. Mike was good with horses. Linda liked Mike, but
he was an old country boy. Mrs. Carson wanted Linda to go out
with the rich boys. Linda was confused at what she wanted. Would true
love win out?" />
