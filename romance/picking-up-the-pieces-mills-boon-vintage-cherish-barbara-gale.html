  <title>Picking Up the Pieces (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Barbara Gale</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;IF HE COULD HAVE ONE WISH, IT WOULD BE THAT HE WERE ANYWHERE ELSE…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But he wasn&#39;t. And neither was she. For as Harry Bensen lived and breathed, supermodel Althea Almott–the very woman who had broken his heart many years ago–was now nursing him back to health! Harry didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or to cry….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For complex personal and professional reasons, Althea had had to walk away from Harry. But she couldn&#39;t very well walk away from the world-famous photographer now. After all, he had practically collapsed on her…literally…and he was the only man to ever have left an imprint on her heart. But once he recuperated and news of her scandalous broken marriage hit the newsstands, he wouldn&#39;t want anything to do with her…or so she thought!&lt;/p&gt;
