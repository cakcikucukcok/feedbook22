        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Holiday Ranch Reunion &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leanne Walsh is stunned when Reuben Walsh returns to his family&#39;s ranch for the holidays. No matter how hard she tried to convince herself that marrying the more stable Walsh brother was the right decision, it was unpredictable Reuben who held her heart – until he broke it. Leanne&#39;s frosty reception cuts deeper than Reuben expected, yet he can&#39;t leave the widowed single mom shorthanded with Christmas drawing near. He built his dreams around Leanne once before, and now is trying to resist her and her sweet young son. But in a season full of surprises, the promise of family is a gift too tempting to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
