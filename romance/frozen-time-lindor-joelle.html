  <title>Frozen Time - Lindor Joelle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No one said adulthood was easy; no one said growing up rich in a poor, Southern town was easy, either.  Joseph Thompson is a young, handsome black man--the son of a billionaire, born to privilege.  He lives in the affluent neighborhood aptly titled The Bridge, sandwiched on one end by housing projects and by a trailer park on the other.  Despite his fathers scorn, while in college,  he falls for Tonya, a common black woman as his father described her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Josephs mother is murdered, dating below his class seems to be the least of his worries.  He strikes up an unlikely friendship with a beautiful blonde named Karen.  Their friendship soon blossoms into something more, and Joseph, Tonya and Karen find themselves trapped in a vicious love triangle of their own making--a triangle their youth lacks the maturity to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph finds himself pulled between the mystery of his mothers death and the possibility of lifelong love with two different women.  Tonya must rise above poverty to prove that life is more than loss, while Karen struggles to battle her addictive demons.  Can such troubled young people truly love one another?  Or will they learn that you cant love someone else without first learning to love and accept yourself?&lt;/p&gt;" />
