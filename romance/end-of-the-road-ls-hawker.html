But Jade quickly begins to notice some strange things about the small Kansas town just beyond the company&amp;#8217;s campus&amp;#8212;why are there no children anywhere to be seen, and for that matter, anyone over the age of forty? Why do all of the people living here act uncomfortable and jumpy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the way home one night, Jade and her co-worker are run off the road, and their lab and living spaces are suddenly overrun with armed guards, purportedly for their safety. Confined to the compound and questioning what her employers might be hiding from her, Jade fears she&amp;#8217;s losing control not only of her invention, but of her very life. It soon becomes clear that the threat reaches far beyond Jade and her family, and the real danger is much closer than she&amp;#8217;d ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
