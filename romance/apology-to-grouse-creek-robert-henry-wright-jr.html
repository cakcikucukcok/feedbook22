&lt;P class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;As the story unfolds, the reader learns that Nathaniel is a member of The Family, the most wealthy and influential family in the northern five counties of the Idaho Panhandle; and that there has been a lifelong rift between Nathaniel and his parents due to him not responding to their ambitions for him. The reader also learns that Esmeralda is a fugitive from a motorcycle gang at Los Angeles, and that the gangs leader has revenge on his mind. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Consequently, Rolf installs himself and Delpha into a remote mountain location where he intends to build a fortress for defending his money and surviving the social cataclysm. However, Rolf soon learns that someone lives above and behind him, and his paranoia compels him to banish Nathaniel and Esmeralda from the plateau by any means necessary, including murder. To accomplish this objective, Rolf employs the forces of money; he uses Esmeraldas dubious past; ultimately, Rolf kills Nathaniels dogan act that Nathaniel is not capable of forgiving. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
