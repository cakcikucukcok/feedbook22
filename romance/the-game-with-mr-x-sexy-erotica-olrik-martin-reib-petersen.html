  <title>The Game with Mr. X - Sexy erotica - - Olrik, Martin Reib Petersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I got a text message. I shouldn&#39;t have looked at all. I grabbed my phone to switch off the sound ahead of time so it wouldn‘t disturb the meeting. But of course, I couldn&#39;t help checking the message:
&quot;No other women can be as wet and as tight as you. Painful how much my body misses yours. P.&quot;
That&#39;s not the kind of text you should receive right before stepping into an important meeting with your boss. How are you supposed to discuss a pay raise when all you can do is smile and think about the violent orgasms you reached with your previous boss, who suddenly has contacted you again? It‘s unbelievable hoe one text can turn your whole world upside down...
This short story is published in collaboration with the Swedish filmproducer Erika Lust. Her intention is to depict human nature and diversity through stories of passion, intimacy, lust and love in a fusion of powerful stories and erotica." />
