  <title>Bikers and Pearls - Vicki Wilkerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bikers and Pearls by Vicki Wilkerson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who said tempting a sweet Southern belle would be easy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When rebel biker Bullworth Clayton gets tangled up with pastel-and-pearls-clad April Church, sparks fly. Sure, April would clearly rather work with anyone else, but if teaming up with Bull means a successful charity event for a sick little boy they both care about, then so be it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;April is baffled at how drawn she is to the leather-wearing, tattooed Bull--he just doesn&#39;t fit with her simple, safe, country-club life. And as much as the handsomely rugged man tempts her, she still can&#39;t shake the images of the tragic motorcycle accident from her past, which left her scarred and her father broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bull tempts her to don a pair of leather pants and go for a ride with him, while April desperately tries to resist her attraction to the wild side and keep her exploits hidden from her small town. Will they be able to navigate their differences and find a middle road to love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
