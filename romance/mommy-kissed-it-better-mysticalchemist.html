  <title>Mommy Kissed it Better - Mysticalchemist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Josie had always been there to kiss her son better, and she wants to keep doing so forever, but her son&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend has other ideas. When he chooses her over his mother, rage drives Josie to the end of the Earth in search of a new life alone, but life intervenes and they reunite in hot passion in the cool of Alaska.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You seem a little upset. Things not go so well with Tisha tonight? You know you can tell me. I might be your mom, but I still know a few things about romance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It feels strange talking to you about things like that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could see the bulge in his pants. He was definitely thinking of me as more than his mom. It was now or never.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to say. I see you&amp;rsquo;re still tense. Would you let me kiss you better so you can get a good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I started moving towards his belt before I finished speaking, and had both hands on the buckle before he opened his mouth. I was looking at his face, but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking at mine. My robe had opened as I bent towards him, his eyes glued to what he could see of my boobs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What can you do?&amp;rdquo; he said, his voice rising to a squeak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Relax and let momma show you what she can do. Relax and enjoy, my baby.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His belt undone, I was working on the zipper, tight with the pressure behind it. I knew my efforts were making my robe open even more, and that was keeping him occupied while I worked. Zip finally completely down and pants opening.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His voice said he knew what I was doing, and he liked it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Relax and enjoy. I won&amp;rsquo;t hurt you. I love you too much to ever hurt you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Able to reach in now, trying to find an opening through his underwear while massaging the bulge it held. He was making noises now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is that nice, baby?&amp;rdquo; I purred.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, but you&amp;rsquo;re my mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Relax.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My fingers found the slit in the cloth and I let my whole hand slip inside, touching his bare flesh for the first time. Feeling the heat and power surging under my fingertips. Moving my fingers to find the head of the throbbing monster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ohhh.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was wriggling now. Helping me free the captive, and it was struggling hard to be set free. My fingers were gripping the head now, and I was pulling it towards the opening as I withdrew my hand. Uncoiling like a wound up spring as it found freedom and pointed itself strongly towards heaven.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d seen his man-grown cock. I&amp;rsquo;d loved watching it develop when he was little, but it had been hidden from my sight for all those teen years. Now I could see how it had grown. Big and strong. Just like his fathers&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No time to waste, I bent down and took the end in my mouth, one hand holding the base. Fingers feeling the pulse of the blood engorging the shaft. Feeling it twitch as my tongue circled the very end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh mom!&amp;rdquo; He moaned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I knew his hands wanted to hold my head, but he was too afraid for now. My robe would be open enough for him to see my boobs dangling so near his body. I let my chest drop lower so the hanging nipples were touching his clothes, rubbing them on him through the material.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh mom!&amp;rdquo; He moaned again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tasting the heat of his lust in my mouth, I worked my lips up and down, sliding them tightly along his shaft. Tongue circling to tickle and tease. Hand stroking, wishing he was naked so my other hand could cup his balls.&lt;br /&gt;
