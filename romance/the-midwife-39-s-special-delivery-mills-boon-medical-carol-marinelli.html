          &lt;strong&gt;A baby for a midwife?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been three years since he left. Now gorgeous Dr. Rory Donovan is back. And midwife Ally Jameson is determined not to lose her heart to him a second time. Surrounded by the excitement and joy of the baby ward, it&#39;s hard for Ally not to remember the love they once shared. Especially when Rory is so caring and gentle with her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Donovan has always known how much Ally really wants children of her own. Will Rory&#39;s feelings for Ally give him the courage to stay this time and have with her the family they both need?&lt;/p&gt;
