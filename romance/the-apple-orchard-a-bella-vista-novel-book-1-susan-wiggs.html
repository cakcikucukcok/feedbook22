  <title>The Apple Orchard (A Bella Vista novel, Book 1) - Susan Wiggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;#1 New York Times bestselling author &lt;strong&gt;Susan Wiggs&lt;/strong&gt; brings readers into the lush abundance of Sonoma County, in a story of sisters, friendship and the invisible bonds of history that are woven like a spell around us.&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tess Delaney makes a living returning stolen treasures to their rightful owners. She loves illuminating history, filling the spaces in people&#39;s hearts with stories of their family legacies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Tess&#39;s own history is filled with gaps: a father she never met, and a mother who spent more time traveling than with her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then Dominic Rossi arrives on the doorstep of the San Francisco shop Tess hopes to buy, and he tells her that the grandfather she never knew is in a coma. Tess has been named in his will to inherit half of Bella Vista, a hundred-acre apple orchard in the magical Sonoma town called Archangel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The rest is willed to Isabel Johansen. A half sister she hadn&#39;t heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Isabel is everything Tess isn&#39;t: all softness to Tess&#39;s hard angles, warm and nurturing where Tess is tightly wound. But against the rich landscape of Bella Vista, with Isabel and Dominic by her side, Tess begins to discover a world filled with the simple pleasures of food and family, of the warm earth beneath her bare feet. A world where family comes first and the roots of history run deep.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Book one in the Bella Vista series&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For fans of Santa Montefiore, Patricia Scanlan and Cathy Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;‘Wiggs tells a layered, powerful story of love, loss, hope and redemption.&#39; – Kirkus, starred review&lt;/strong&gt;
