  <title>The Truth Behind Truth - Sherif A. El-Mawardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Humans ask this question frequently, what is love?! A lot of us believe that we know the true meaning of the word, while in reality; it is a word that has a lot of definitions according to each persons point of view.
Some think that love can be told by words, others think its something felt by actions. But the problem isnt in the meaning of the word. The real question is how far could you go for someone you love?
To what extent would you endure and bear the pain subjected by the one you love? When is it time to let go?! Is it possible?
&quot;Ironic isnt it, we ignore the ones who adore us, adore the ones that ignore us, love the ones who hurt us, and hurt the ones that love us?!&quot;~ Jordan Neil
Yet, sometimes that hurt makes us blind to see the truth. Or maybe what you think is the truth, is actually the camouflage of the truth. Sometimes the truth isnt on the surface. You have to see what lies beyond thatYou have to look for the truth behind truth." />
