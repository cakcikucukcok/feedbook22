      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Brawny bush pilot Sam Edwards only cared about two things: his son and his daughter. Though raising a family single-handedly was difficult, Sam knew–despite the townfolks&#39; prodding–he needed a baby-sitter, not a bride.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And independent T. J. Walker–a strong, nurturing single mom more leery of love than Sam–was up for the job. His kids took to T.J. and her son like bees to blossoms, and Sam&#39;s own granite heart softened amid his makeshift family. Still, wary of rejection, T.J. had built a mile-high wall around her emotions. But would Sam prove to be the best man to show her what being &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; was all about?&lt;/p&gt;
