  <title>The Prenuptial - Janet M. Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jewel Boulanger, a twenty-five-year-old artist and heiress of Boulanger du Jour, an international bakery chain, was adopted by a wealthy judge and his wife when she was three. She has always wanted to meet her real father and to find out who killed her mother. Leaving Paris and returning to Atlanta to marry Antonio Vance, the governors son, in a wedding fit for a princess, she brings three friends. 
After being away for seven years, her Georgia homecoming is everything she hoped it would be. Yet once she settles in, things dont seem so peachy. She worries about the fate of Lance Carpenter, the dashing firefighter who saved her life seven years ago, who now sits on death row for a murder she believes he didnt commit. 
She cannot marry Antonio until Lances case is settled. 
To do so, she must work with savvy criminal defense attorney, Robert Boulanger, a mysterious uncle from New Orleans who is handling Lances latest appeal. Her uncle Bobby wants to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
But what is the truth? 
Most of the people who know are either dead or missing in action.
As Jewel catches up with old friends, discovers her true roots, and reflects on the night that changed her life, she questions her upcoming nuptials and prenuptials. 
Does she truly love Tony? Does she still love Lance? 
From the moment she arrives home until her wedding day, she uncovers many truths, and most are not what she expected." />
