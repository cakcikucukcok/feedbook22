A male like Laroque. Working undercover to infiltrate his psyche, Emily discovered a noble man&amp;#151;and an undeniable attraction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amid the hot nights, Emily found herself falling for the magnetic Laroque. And if he discovered her true identity, she might lose not only her chance at love, but also her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
