      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming to the rescue of beautiful nurse Lacey Kirk while she interrupted a murder wasn&#39;t the encounter Dr. Nick Marino had in mind when he first set eyes on her. Now, as he held her and offered protection, he wanted to believe the attack was random. Unfortunately, the chilling death threats made it clear that it wasn&#39;t. An expert at covering up his infamous past, clues proved Lacey&#39;s attack was connected to Nick&#39;s true identity. But as much as he wanted the sexy brunette in his bed, Nick couldn&#39;t admit he was to blame for endangering her life. And experience taught him it would be far more dangerous&amp;#151;even fatal&amp;#151;to reveal his secret loyalties.&amp;#133;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
