  <title>Virtuous Deception - Leiann  B Wrytes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Only one thing stood between Frank Mason and his $20 million inheritance-- a wife. When he found, Lisa, he didn&amp;#39;t waste any time marrying her, but their fairytale romance was not built to last. Lisa&amp;#39;s infidelity doesn&amp;#39;t go unnoticed, but Frank has his reasons for maintaining his silence. That&amp;#39;s until he uncovers some new information about his step ford wife that lands him in jail. Only then does their picture-perfect life start to unravel, dragging every last skeleton out of his closet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lisa Raine was an exotic dancer desperately seeking a way out. Frank Mason posed as the perfect escape. However, Lisa&amp;#39;s ex-lover, Lewis, was not willing to let her go without a price. After years of paying Lewis to keep her past a secret, the money soon dries up, and both Lisa and Lewis are forced to alter their arrangement. Things take a turn for the worse and only one of them may make it out alive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Michelle Lewis, a private investigator, has managed to avoid mixing business with pleasure until an assignment sends her world colliding into the Mason&amp;#39;s. When Brianna Mason is kidnapped, it is left to Michelle and her boyfriend to find her. Michelle unexpectedly stumbles across startling evidence that will irreversibly alter her and Brianna&amp;#39;s life. Desperate for the truth, Michelle sifts through their families past, ripping old wounds, exposing forbidden relationships, and breaking years of silence to get it. Will the truth set them free or is it only the beginning of their parents arranged virtuous deception?&lt;/p&gt;" />
