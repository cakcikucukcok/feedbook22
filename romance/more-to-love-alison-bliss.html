  <title>More to Love - Alison Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This laugh-out-loud romantic comedy proves that, when enemies become lovers, all bets are off!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Jessa Gibson may be new in the little town of Granite, Texas, but in no time at all her gourmet food truck business is booming. Soon she&#39;ll have enough money to open the restaurant of her dreams. But first, she&#39;ll have to appease the hot local health inspector, no matter how strange his &quot;violations&quot; sound to her. No pink plastic gloves? Really? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Max Hager isn&#39;t &lt;i&gt;exactly &lt;/i&gt;who he says he is. Pretending to be a health inspector is a (mostly) innocent mistake. A mistake made way worse by Max&#39;s immediate, electrifying attraction to the curvy, sexy, redheaded chef. Throw in a whole lot of lust, and things in Jessa&#39;s little kitchen are about to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; start heating up. But can Max find a way to come clean with Jessa before his little deception turns into a recipe for disaster?" />
