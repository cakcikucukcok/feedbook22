      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the turmoil of 2011, an American college administrator and a German socio-economics expert attempt to rectify the past to save their children and preserve the fragile world in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel Michels made a poor choice which resulted in her biggest blessing, her daughter, Maeve. When the father of that blessing returns decades later, she knows he wants something she&amp;rsquo;d taken from him. Rachel has lived in near seclusion and mistrust, fearful of losing the one person who&amp;rsquo;s kept her life from coming unglued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Gervas Friedemann returns to Wisconsin, seeking a missing ancient artifact, along with help for his oldest daughter who is suffering from a rare genetic blood disorder. With the European Union at stake, blackmail could negatively impact a crucial vote in the German Parliament unless Gervas recovers an irreplaceable relic he left in the United States on a lecture tour a lifetime ago. He knows who took the piece of history he once flaunted&amp;mdash;the woman who had stolen his soul. He only hopes she still has the ring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
