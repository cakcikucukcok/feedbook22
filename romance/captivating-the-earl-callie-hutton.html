  <title>Captivating the Earl - Callie Hutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To escape her traitorous father&#39;s reputation, Lady Elizabeth has left behind the glittering balls of London Society to act as a governess. For the first time in her life, she&#39;s independent and taking care of herself. All is fine...until the irresistible Lord Hawkins arrives at her employer&#39;s house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Hawkins is a rake of the highest order, but the beautiful governess working for his cousin makes him want to act like a gentleman. After an attempt on her life, Hawk discovers who Elizabeth really is. Now under orders from the Home Office to bring her in, he vows instead to protect her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hawk may be handsome and honorable, but falling for him will surely bring Lizzie heartbreak. Especially when he proposes the only way to keep her safe is to marry her. She doesn&#39;t want his name if he&#39;s only doing it out of a sense of duty. But someone in the Home Office wants Lizzie dead, and even becoming his countess may not save her life...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Lords &amp; Ladies in Love series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Seducing the Marquess&lt;br&gt;* Marrying the Wrong Earl&lt;br&gt;* Denying the Duke&lt;br&gt;* Wagering For Miss Blake&lt;br&gt;* Captivating the Earl&lt;/p&gt;" />
