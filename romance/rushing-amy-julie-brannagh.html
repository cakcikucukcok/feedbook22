  <title>Rushing Amy - Julie Brannagh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julie Brannagh&#39;s sparkling and romantic Love and Football series continues!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Amy Hamilton, only three Fs matter: Family, Football, and Flowers. It might be nice to find someone to share Forever with, too, but right now she&#39;s working double overtime while she gets her flower shop off the ground. The last thing she needs or wants is a distraction &amp;#8230; or help, for that matter. Especially in the form of gorgeous and aggravatingly arrogant ex-NFL star Matt Stephens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt lives by a playbook&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; playbook. He never thought his toughest opponent would come in the form of a stunning florist with a stubborn streak to match his own. Since meeting her in the bar after her sister&#39;s wedding, he&#39;s known there&#39;s something between them. After she refuses&amp;#8212;again and again&amp;#8212;to go out with him, Matt will do anything to win her heart &amp;#8230; But will Amy, who has everything to lose, let the clock run out on the one-yard line?&lt;/p&gt;" />
