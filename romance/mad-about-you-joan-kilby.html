  <title>Mad About You - Joan Kilby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man she can&#39;t refuse...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accountant Cassy Morris knows she&#39;s putting her heart on the line when she agrees to move in with her best friend, multi-millionaire geek Scott Thornton. The arrangement is purely business: she&#39;ll manage his nanotechnology lab and find an angel investor for his revolutionary new product. But there&#39;s a problem: she&#39;s loved him forever even though he&#39;s only ever regarded her as a friend. She&#39;ll have to harden her heart to survive their arrangement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;A woman he can&#39;t resist...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Scott is named Seattle&#39;s sexiest man, the unexpected attention from women threatens to get in the way of him meeting his project deadline. Once again, Cassy steps up to the plate, this time pretending to be his fiancé to keep the women away. But a lifetime of repressed sexual tension explodes within her and before long she and Scott are entwined in a passionate affair. Will Scott be able to convince Cassy to trust his feelings and turn their fake engagement into reality?&lt;/p&gt;" />
