  <title>The Life Story of an Island Girl - Ann Labbé</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Part 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is inspired by the life of an island girl who grows up in not a very loving family. She finds refuge in her beautiful garden, dreaming of love and indulgence. Her brother has monopolized the love of their mother. When her dream of studying abroad is shattered she finds a job amidst narrow-minded colleagues. Still she aims to find her own happiness. During a trip to the Seychelles, she meets a German who falls in love with her and invites her to his country. She ends up marrying him and starts a new life. But still longing for love and recognition of her blood family, she becomes their ‘milch-cow’, granting them all their wishes. In Germany life is not easy, with two unfriendly stepchildren and a narcissistic husband. The birth of her son is a blessing. But her husband becomes more and more estranged to her. After a decade of passivity, she becomes skeptical as to her husband’s self-proclaimed spirituality and takes distance from him and his gurus. He leaves her all of a sudden for a younger submissive woman and she is left alone with her son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is completely at her husband’s mercy because of a contract of marriage in which she was denied any rights as his wife. He reveals his meanness to her and plans to get her incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital. Her little boy warns her in time. Her blood family lets her down, her only brother tries to take over her property on the island. Both husband and brother shout from the rooftops that she is mad. She loses all her friends and even her beloved father lets her down. But the woman is a fighter. She finds inner strength in adversity. Left alone, she fights for her rights, struggles for years and wins. Her house is full of music and laughter and her son and her have a lot of fun together. After fourteen difficult years, without drums and trumpets, she finds success and peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
