  <title>Mom&#39;s New Man - Victoria Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In her rational mind, Jill is well aware that her son needs a woman of his own. The needy woman in her, though, can&amp;rsquo;t bear the thought of losing him to another woman. Indeed, once she allows him in, once they cross that line, she can&amp;rsquo;t seem to let go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, I knew I was nearing the very edge of risqu&amp;eacute;, even bordering on slutty, but as long as the thong didn&amp;rsquo;t creep too far in, I&amp;rsquo;d be fine&amp;mdash;or so I told myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I finished my wine, then stopped in my bathroom to touch up my lipstick. I left my empty glass in the kitchen, on my way through to the garage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His gaze went right where I expected it to, and remained there as I approached. I reached out to tease the cuff of his t-shirt, where it was stretched tight around his bicep, then I leaned close to whisper in his ear. &amp;ldquo;Not supposed to lust after your momma.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He cleared his throat. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m, um...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shushed him then bit down on his earlobe, gently. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m flattered.&amp;rdquo;" />
