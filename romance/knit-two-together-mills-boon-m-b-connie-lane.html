  <title>Knit Two Together (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Connie Lane</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Her mother remained a mystery in life…and in death&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Libby Cartwright hadn&#39;t planned on inheriting a yarn shop from her estranged mother. But that was before she found her favorite childhood stuffed animal amidst the dust and moldering yarn. And before she encountered a motley crew of locals determined to resurrect the store. So what else had Mom been hiding?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Running Metropolitan Knits means Libby still has lots to learn. About knitting. Motherhood (who ever said raising a daughter was easy!). And even romance. For quiet Hal O&#39;Connell, an unlikely–and unattached–new customer, turns out to be a kindred spirit. As the Grand Reopening approaches, Libby learns to knit two together–in knitting and in life….&lt;/p&gt;
