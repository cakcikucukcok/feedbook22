  <title>Stardust Dads - Josephine C. George, David R. George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The e-mail Danny and Allison read on their new computer in 1996 looks no different from the millions of others received by Web users around the world, with one glaring exception--it was sent by their dads who died during the 1970s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While residing in the afterworld at an amenity-laden paradise called Midway Manor, guitar-strumming Mickey Parks and piano-playing Lloyd Wallace monitor and manipulate the lives of their adult children on earth from the mid-&#39;70s through the 1990s. Tampering with the facility&#39;s sophisticated computer, the dads thrust Mickey&#39;s daughter Allison and Lloyd&#39;s son Danny into a passionate but sometimes stormy relationship-a relationship steeped in Danny&#39;s heavy drinking and entangled in the often-zany world of men&#39;s adventure magazine publishing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After carefully implementing a plan to send their son and daughter a gift of knowledge that could enrich their lives forever, the dads&#39; brief contact is cut short. They are banished to another destination in the afterworld, but not before they impart indisputable proof of life after death--and unwittingly put Danny&#39;s and Allison&#39;s earthbound lives on the line." />
