  <title>The Last Decision - Victoria Wilcox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;His name conjures images of the Wild West, of gunfights and gambling halls and a legendary friendship with the lawman Wyatt Earp. But before Doc Holliday was a Western legend he was a Southern son, born in the last days before the American Civil War and raised to be a Southern gentleman. Now the story of his life as told in Southern Son: The Saga of Doc Holliday comes to a dramatic conclusion in The Last Decision. John Henry Holliday has left his outlaw past behind as he arrives in the silver boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona Territory, where there are fortunes to be made by anyone daring enough to stand up to the stage robbers and rustlers who infest the nearby mountains. But John Henry is only trying to make a little money off the gambling tables when he&amp;#39;s caught up in a secretive plot to stop the disturbances before they start a threatened war with Mexico. When suspicions rise and tempers ignite, the plot turns into a war between cowboys and lawmen, and John Henry becomes a player in the most famous street fight in the Wild West. The aftermath brings murder and revenge and revelations that challenge everything he thinks he knows about his friends, his family, and himself. The Last Decision is a tale of sin and recompense and the redeeming power of love, of the making of legends, and the making of a hero.&lt;/p&gt;" />
