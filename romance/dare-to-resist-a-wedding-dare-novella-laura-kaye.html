  <title>Dare to Resist (a Wedding Dare novella) - Laura Kaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kady Dresco and Colton Brooks click on a level that defies logic. There are only two problems. One, he&#39;s her older brother&#39;s irritating best friend, and two, they&#39;re bidding on the same military security services contract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the competition heats up, Colton is torn between wanting to strangle Kady (and her annoying brilliance) and kissing her into &lt;i&gt;submission&lt;/i&gt;. Which is a bad idea for a million reasons, because Kady&#39;s submission is exactly what he craves. Being trapped in a tiny motel room with the object of his darkest fantasies will require every ounce of his restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kady doesn&#39;t want his restraint, but Colton knows better. She deserves love, marriage, and a white picket fence--three things Colton can&#39;t give her. But her proximity and the memory of their steamy near-miss three years ago slowly destroys his resolve. And he&#39;s not sure how much longer he can keep his hands off...or his heart closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Wedding Dare series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Falling for the Groomsman&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jen McLaughlin, w/a Diane Alberts &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baiting the Maid of Honor&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tessa Bailey&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seducing the Bridesmaid&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Katee Robert&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Man with Benefits&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Samanthe Beck&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dare to Resist&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Laura Kaye&lt;/p&gt;" />
