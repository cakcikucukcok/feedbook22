  <title>Real Men Do It Better - Lora Leigh, Susan Donovan, Lori Wilde, Carrie Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this sizzing collection from some of romance&#39;s hottest authors, you&#39;ll read four sexy short stories about women who discover that real men do it better...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Lora Leigh&#39;s FOR MAGGIE&#39;S SAKE, Maggie Chavez from Leigh&#39;s sexy Navy SEALs series is in protective custody with a member of her former lover&#39;s SEALs team.  Joe, her ex-lover, thinks Maggie is hiding information from him about a powerful drug lord and the deaths of some SEALs.  He intends to seduce her and get the information before she can sell it back to the drug cartel.  But when a member of the notorious crime family captures Maggie and holds her hostage at gunpoint, Joe realizes how wrong he is, and only he can save her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Susan Donovan&#39;s BED AND BREAKFAST, a stressed-out corporate dynamo with designer boots and a bad attitude is sent to the New Mexico mountains to &quot;get centered&quot; or not come back to Los Angeles. She arrives at the rustic Windwalker Lodge north of Santa Fe, only to find the place in the middle of a renovation and the hunky owner in a pair of lounge pants with no shirt and no idea she was coming. She plans to leave on the first available shuttle the next morning, but one of the area&#39;s notorious rains washes out the bridge, and she&#39;s stuck. Though resistant at first, she eventually lets the beautiful setting and the extraordinary man give her a new perspective on life, love, and especially sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Lori Wilde&#39;s SIREN&#39;S CALL, Annie Grave is back in her hometown, St. Augustine, looking after her grandfather&#39;s dive shop as he lies bedridden with a broken hip.  Though she is a Harvard MBA with a high-powered finance job in Manhattan and a boyfriend on the brink of proposing marriage, she&#39;s never forgotten her first love, sun-bronzed dive instructor Duncan Stewart--or the day years earlier when she lost her virginity to him and he told her it was just a fling.  But what she doesn&#39;t know is that Duncan has regretted that decision every day since.  Afraid of not being able to hold onto a smart, sexy, beautiful woman like Annie, he pushed her away and ran away from St. Augustine.  But now she&#39;s back, and so is he, and he&#39;s cooked up a plan to win her back.  After all, what girl could resist the lure of buried treasure, and a hot, handsome Scotsman to guide her on the hunt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Carrie Alexander&#39;s HIS BODY ELECTRIC, an aloof stranger arrives at Karen Jaffe&#39;s farmhouse seeking shelter at the height of a violent lightning storm. Strange events follow--the power goes out, every clock stops, sparks fly from the visitor&#39;s fingertips. Alone in the dark with him, Karen uses her skills as a phone sex operator to seduce the mystery man, uncovering the secrets and erotic pleasures of HIS BODY ELECTRIC.&lt;/p&gt;" />
