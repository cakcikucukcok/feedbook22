  <title>When the Rancher Came to Town - Emma Cane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Valentine Valley!&lt;br /&gt;The Silver Creek Rodeo is in full swing, and everyone&amp;#39;s talking about the rancher who came to town &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bed-and-breakfast owner Amanda Cramer wants nothing more than a quiet, private life. Well, she wants guests too, but after suffering her share of unwanted notoriety, she&amp;#39;s gotten comfortable hiding out in her inn &amp;#8230; perhaps a little too comfortable. When her newest customer arrives&amp;#8212;tall, dark, and breathtaking&amp;#8212;Amanda begins to question her self-imposed exile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ex-rodeo star Mason Lopez knows all about the limelight. He&amp;#39;d avoid it if he could, but since one last ride could mean saving his family&amp;#39;s ranch, he&amp;#39;ll go all in. When he gets to Valentine Valley for the Silver Creek Rodeo, Mason checks into the Connections B&amp;#38;B and finds himself immediately drawn to the beautiful, reserved woman who owns it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mason has only three days in town &amp;#8230; can he convince Amanda to open her heart to him and welcome the world back in?&lt;/p&gt;" />
