  <title>False Family (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Mary Anne Wilson</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Mistletoe and murder…&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It seemed simple. An eccentric billionaire who didn&#39;t trust his heirs had asked Mallory King to pose as his long-lost daughter over the holidays. But she didn&#39;t expect the lethal intentions of his greedy relatives–or expect to meet a man like darkly compelling Tony Carella, whose eyes followed her everywhere she went….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tony didn&#39;t like gold diggers, and he thought Mallory was bamboozling his elderly business partner. In order to uncover the truth about this mysterious woman, he needed to get close to her, but he never expected to fall under her spell. He was willing to go to any lengths to get Mallory out of the way…including seduction. But murder…?&lt;/p&gt;
