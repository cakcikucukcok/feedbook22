      <meta name="description" content="It&amp;#39;s out of this world! For the first time, author Alana Church bundles four of her tales of the supernatural! Angels, aliens, ghosts, and sexy shapeshifters! They all have one thing on their minds! To find a willing human. And these humans are VERY willing!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From &amp;quot;Star Seed&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Chara, when we first met, I called myself Estelle DeLight,&amp;quot; Andi said with nervous honesty. &amp;quot;After that, when you guessed my nickname, I let you call me Andi. But my name, my true name, is Andromeda Estelle Selene. I don&amp;#39;t know what my parents were thinking. It always made me wonder if they&amp;#39;d gotten high the night they chose my name. But I was named for the stars. Andromeda is our name for the closest galaxy to ours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I am not sure whether it&amp;#39;s fate, or simply coincidence. But I love you. I want to be with you. Before you leave me, I want to be your lover.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chara&amp;#39;s lips curved in a secret smile. Without speaking a word, she dropped her towel and walked to Andi. Her hands brushed across her hips and shoulders, and suddenly her bikini vanished. With a tiny pop of displaced air, it reappeared, neatly folded, on a chair nearby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Andi swallowed. &amp;quot;Well. That seems to be a useful trick.&amp;quot; She was proud that no sign of a quaver entered her voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Indeed,&amp;quot; said Chara. With no warning at all, she was nude as well, her swimsuit vanishing as if it had never existed. Her eyes gleamed with amusement as Andi&amp;#39;s eyes widened. &amp;quot;Which also means the trick works for us both.&amp;quot; She stepped into Andi&amp;#39;s arms. She closed her eyes against a wave of emotion. &amp;quot;Andromeda,&amp;quot; she said musingly. &amp;quot;It fits you, my love. Bold and beautiful, and unexpectedly complex.&amp;quot; Her arms tightened around Andi&amp;#39;s waist. &amp;quot;But I must confess,&amp;quot; she said, her eyes glinting. &amp;quot;I have not had intercourse in this form. You will have to be my guide.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Andi looked down between their bodies. Their breasts brushed against each other lightly, and she shook with the depth of her desire for this wonderful creature. &amp;quot;I feel...tingly,&amp;quot; Chara said softly. &amp;quot;In my belly. Whenever I look at you. I know your society has a taboo against public nudity, but when we are together I want to take my clothes off and touch myself. Especially here.&amp;quot; Her hands drifted down to her groin. There was a soft strip of fuzz which matched the hair on her head, tightly curled. &amp;quot;And I want to touch you as well. All over. It hurts to pull myself away when we are close.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Andi smiled. For one of the few times since she had met Chara, she felt on firm ground. She placed her hand over Chara&amp;#39;s. &amp;quot;That is one of our erogenous zones, sweetie. Women have many. Far more than men, poor things.&amp;quot; She stroked Chara&amp;#39;s shoulders, feeling her fever-hot skin. She wanted to wrap her body around herself, to bask in her glow. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t hold back on my account. Do what feels good.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot; Chara looked up gratefully. With a groan, she spread her legs." />
