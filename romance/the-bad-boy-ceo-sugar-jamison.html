  <title>The Bad Boy CEO - Sugar Jamison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bad Boys of Destiny are back and this playboy billionaire has his sights set on more than just a merger.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colt  King has spent his whole life trying to prove he&#39;s not the trash his  hometown of Destiny, Nevada, thought he and his brothers were. As soon as  he was old enough he left town, vowing to make a name for himself and  never looking back at the place that looked down on him. But that plan  goes out the window when his ailing elderly aunt asks him to come home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He  begrudgingly returns to help the woman who raised him. But he&#39;s no  longer the poor kid from the bad part of town. He&#39;s the ruler of a  custom car empire and a financial genius. He arrives expecting a boring  stay, but when he walks into his childhood home to find a woman in  nothing but her underwear pointing a shotgun at his face, he knows his  trip home will be a memorable one. With his aunt sick and forcing him to  help her restore her fledgling hair salon, he has more than enough on  his plate. Colt has no idea that her sexy tenant, Zanna, is going to be  the cause of his many sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zanna Jacobs came to the  ghost town of Destiny to stay out of trouble and stay the hell away from  men. She&#39;s got a serious thing for bad boys that&#39;s she trying to kick,  and when she lays her eyes on the brutishly handsome Colt, she knows  he&#39;s got bad news written all over him. He&#39;s not the typical thug she  goes for: He&#39;s too clean cut, too good looking, and too cold--and when he  comes to take over her salon, she&#39;s not going to take it. Zanna decides to show him exactly  who the boss is. Colt is used to people following his orders, and  when Zanna challenges his every word he finds her infuriating and  incredibly sexy. He can&#39;t keep his hands off her...and knows that once he  returns to Las Vegas, all bets are off...&lt;/p&gt;" />
