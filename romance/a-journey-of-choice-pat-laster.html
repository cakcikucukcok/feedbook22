  <title>A Journey of Choice - Pat Laster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written with elegance, imagination, and historical savvy, Pat Laster&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Journey of Choice&lt;/i&gt; grabbed me from the beginning and drew me into the life and travails of Liddy Underhill 
Sandy Raschke, Fiction Editor, &lt;i&gt;Calliope, A Writer&#39;s Workshop by Mail&lt;/i&gt;
In 1932, young Liddy Underhill, just graduated from high school, lands a reporters job in an adjacent town and hitches a ride with a peddler who lives there. From the first night of her journey throughout the next decade, Liddy is beset with challenges. She marries and begins a life with her husband, Heth.  When tragedy changes the course of her life, though, Liddy must find a way to reclaim her life and find happiness,
Along the way, she becomes the victim of a womanizer, a controlling doctor, and an arsonist. She suffers abandonment and an emotional breakdown. Set in the Missouri Ozarks of the 1930s, &lt;i&gt;A Journey of Choice&lt;/i&gt; tells the riveting tale of an enterprising young woman dealing with events beyond her control and the message of hope that emerges from her story." />
