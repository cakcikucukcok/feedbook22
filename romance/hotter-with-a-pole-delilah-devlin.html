  <title>Hotter with a Pole - Delilah Devlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Noah hopes buying the classic &#39;68 Camaro from a fellow firefighter&#39;s widow will ease some of the grief weighing down his heart. When a noise under the hood sends him looking for a mechanic, he finds so much more. Big and burly Hoyt grabs Noah&#39;s attention right off, and not just because of his bad-boy biker looks and ice-blue eyes. The fact Hoyt is a Dom and a member at Club LaForge certainly interests Noah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoyt never thought he&#39;d feel that rush with a man again after his partner died, but his body certainly reacts to meeting Noah. LaForge seems like the perfect place to meet and work off some energy and explore this sudden flood of desire. The heat between them starts to burn through their emotional barriers, whether the men are ready to make a deeper connection or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each novella in the Delta Fire series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Series order:&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Burning Up Memphis&lt;br&gt;Book 2: Hotter with a Pole&lt;br&gt;Book 3: Rapid Entry&lt;/p&gt;" />
