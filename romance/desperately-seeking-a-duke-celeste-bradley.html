  <title>Desperately Seeking A Duke - Celeste Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The only way for vicar&#39;s daughter Phoebe Millbury to inherit a family fortune is to find herself a duke--just as her late grandfather demanded in his will. But Phoebe, who&#39;s still  trying to make good after a romantic scandal, also has her two cousins to contend with. They&#39;re all competing for the same money, maybe even the same men. ..until Phoebe meets her match in the terribly handsome and charming Rafe Marbrook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she receives a marriage proposal from the Marquis of Brookhaven, Phoebe is thrilled to learn that Rafe is headed for dukedom...and accepts his offer. There&#39;s only one problem: It&#39;s from Rafe&#39;s older, less captivating brother, Calder. Now Phoebe finds herself on the verge of yet another scandal as she faces a desperate choice: Marry Calder for his money--or follow her own heart? Each way can only lead to trouble...&lt;/p&gt;" />
