When she opens the door to&amp;nbsp;see the man she&amp;rsquo;s been secretly sweet on since the first day he walked into her bakery, she fears her heart will be demolished.&amp;nbsp; At least&amp;nbsp;she knows she&amp;rsquo;s in for a wild ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a past like his, private investigator Garrett McBride doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel he&amp;rsquo;s worthy of a good&amp;nbsp;woman&amp;rsquo;s love. Especially not Ricki, the sweet, beautiful baker. But its not just her delectable baked goods that keep him coming back and it isn&amp;rsquo;t long before he admits to himself that he wants her for his own. He never suspects that the greatest danger to her may come not from himself, but from the deceitful woman Ricki has befriended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love may not be the only thing Ricki&amp;nbsp;falls into&amp;nbsp;along the way as she finds herself in a world of deceit and betrayal that may cost her life. While Ricki is fighting for her life, Garrett must find her, before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 1: Branded for You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 2: Roping Your Heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 3: Fencing You In&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 4: Tying You Down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 5: Playing with You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 6: Crazy for You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 7: Hot for You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 8: Made for You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 9: Held by You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 10: Belong to You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 11: Amazed by You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 12: Loved by You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 13: Midnight with You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 14: Wild for You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 0.5 Read Creed McBride&amp;rsquo;s Story in Roses and Rodeo in the Rough and Ready series&lt;/p&gt;" />
