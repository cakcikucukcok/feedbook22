  <title>A Painter in Paradise - Anna Maija</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He came to Paris to become a famous Painter, but he got way more than he could ever bargain for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking Among Giants is an epic love story that crosses oceans and time capturing the history of the modern art era, Jazz, flappers, and wild all- night parties witnessed through the memoirs of a young painter in the 1920&amp;rsquo;s. Artist Robert Tauney was always a dreamer. After serving in the Great War, He ventures home to mourn the death of his beloved Mother and confront his worst enemy, his own personal Demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After serving in the Great War, Robert follows his inspiration to venture to Paris, France.&amp;nbsp; He soon befriends film stars, painters, authors, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Modigliani, Soutine, Picasso, Erik Satie, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and many other creative intellectuals of the time. The plot deepens with unrequited love, the Model/Entertainer- Kiki of Montparnasse, and Camille Bastain (Tigress), a French actress who slowly pulls him into the dark world of opium and drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Robert will soon find out that Paris has an ancient secret awaiting him.&amp;nbsp; In an epoch time of passion and a sexual revolution, a symbolic tidal wave of destruction and chaos is forming. Robert is at the Crossroads of his life and must make a crucial decision or be swept away in the Tsunami of deception, denial, and addiction while facing impossible odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This Novel is a gorgeous, and compelling work that brings the non-artist closer to the painting process and the workings of the artistic mind. This fictional work gives a rare look at what it might have been like as an artist in Paris during the roaring twenties, living and Walking Among Giants in the midst of a lost generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
