      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She&#39;s driven by his desire...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It took all of Alexia&#39;s courage to leave her abusive boyfriend and strike out on her own. When she lands a job at a glamorous sports agency, she thinks she finally has made it. But shy, blond, and beautiful, Alexia is totally unprepared for the fast sexual politics of rich men and ambitious women that is waiting for her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of all, she is totally unprepared for her new boss, Nathan Fallon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nathan is an ex-Army officer, dazzling but damaged, who has risen to the top of the cutthroat world of sports agents. There is no one Alexia wants more, but a case of mistaken identity has Nathan believing she&#39;s given herself over to the advances of the office playboy. Desperate to win Nathan&#39;s respect, Alexia agrees to become his substitute personal assistant. It doesn&#39;t take long for the sparks to fly...and for Alexia to find herself enthralled by a man she cannot read and could never resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What readers are saying:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Brilliant.
