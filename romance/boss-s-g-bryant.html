  <title>Boss - S. G. Bryant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boss&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the life and times of Mary Emily Susannah (Minnie) Hunter, and her experiences on the frontiers of nineteenth century Australia.&amp;nbsp; Born into a family of famous horsemen and pioneers, Minnie inherits her family&amp;rsquo;s love of horses as well as an affinity with the wild landscape at the edge of settled Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child she meets John Brewer, a self-made pastoralist and outstanding young horseman.&amp;nbsp; She quickly comes to idolise the man she calls &amp;lsquo;Boss&amp;rsquo;, and the friendship she strikes up marks the beginning of a devotion that lasts her whole life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her commitment to Boss comes at a huge cost to Minnie.&amp;nbsp; She sacrifices everything, including the prospect of marriage and a family, to support him as he struggles to build a pastoral empire from a harsh and unforgiving land.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to be with Boss, Minnie must also endure life with John&amp;rsquo;s passionate but wildly erratic wife, Lizzie, the woman who bears him thirteen children, but whose impulsive, restless nature is ill-suited to the lonely, isolated life of a squatter&amp;rsquo;s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book explores the frustrations and trials endured by these three, as they each struggle to realise their hopes and dreams and to find fulfilment in their lives.&amp;nbsp; Over the years their lives continue to intertwine, even after Minnie starts a new life running a boarding house in St Kilda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately Minnie finds a kind of peace and contentment with John, but at what cost to all of them?&amp;nbsp; And has she betrayed her own moral values, when she faces &amp;lsquo;the worst accusation any woman could make of another&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also charts the terrible fate that befell the Boandik and Wiradjuri tribes, who Minnie lived with and befriended over her life.&amp;nbsp; In the space of a generation, disease and white apathy and neglect wiped out these people and their traditional way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boss&lt;/em&gt; is based on the published diaries of Minnie Hunter, creatively interpreted to highlight the complex relationships between the three main characters, and to canvass their remarkable lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
