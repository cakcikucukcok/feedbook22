  <title>Mother&#39;s Darling Boy - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Damien is hot for his mother. He knows it&amp;#39;s wrong. It&amp;#39;s taboo. But he doesn&amp;#39;t care. He wants her badly but knows nothing will ever come of it. Mom fantasizes about her son, too, and knows it&amp;#39;s wrong. When an ironic coincidence happens that throws them together, they both take advantage of the situation and realize their deepest desires. Will they continue having sex with one another, or is this the first and only time it will happen?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Another get-together at my house for the guys on the team, and another chance for them to drool over my mother. It really pisses me off. My Dad left us years ago and she has worked hard to keep us going. She&amp;rsquo;s now very successful in her own right, and we&amp;rsquo;re living pretty well. I respect her for everything she&amp;rsquo;s accomplished and for my friends to call her a MILF, it makes me want to punch their lights out. She&amp;rsquo;s mine, and no one else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s time for me to pick a college since I&amp;rsquo;ll be graduating from high school soon. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to attend a college close by so I can still live with her. I am the man of the house, after all. A woman alone needs protection. She needs lots of attention. A man&amp;rsquo;s attentions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I fully realize that my anger for my friends is not really called for. Not when I have my own fantasies about my mother. I&amp;rsquo;ve had them ever since Dad left, when I was just a little pisher. And they have only grown over the years. She&amp;rsquo;s off limits&amp;hellip;taboo. But I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about her, longing for her, jerking off to fantasies about her. It&amp;rsquo;s got to stop." />
