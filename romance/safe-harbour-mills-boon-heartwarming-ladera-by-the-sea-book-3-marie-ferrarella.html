            &lt;em&gt;If he stays, she&#39;s in danger. But if he leaves… &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All Mike Ryan can tell her is his name. Revealing any more to this beautiful stranger would put her in danger. And he&#39;s not willing to jeopardize Stevi Roman&#39;s–or her family&#39;s–safety any more than he already has. Why this angel has taken him in, nursed him and trusted him, he can&#39;t fathom. But it has been the best few weeks he&#39;s ever known. For the first time, Mike can imagine having a real life, a real identity, a real future. Stevi has done more than save him. She&#39;s inspired him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s why he has to go. The safest thing he could do for all of them is to disappear….&lt;/p&gt;
