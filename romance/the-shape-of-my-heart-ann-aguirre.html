  <title>The Shape Of My Heart - Ann Aguirre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Some people wait decades to meet their soul mate. Courtney Kaufman suspects she met hers in high school–only to lose him at seventeen.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Since then, Courtney&#39;s social life has been a series of meaningless encounters, though she&#39;s made a few close friends along the way. Especially her roommate, Max Cooper, who oozes damaged bad-boy vibes from every pore.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Max knows about feeling lost–he&#39;s been on his own since he was sixteen. Now it&#39;s time to find out if he can ever go home again, and Courtney&#39;s the only one he trusts to go with him. But the trip to Providence could change everything….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It started out so simple. One misfit helping another. Now Max will do anything to show Courtney that for every heart that&#39;s ever been broken, there&#39;s another that can make it complete.&lt;/p&gt;
