      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a bet between two old flames . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rex Leighton dominates the boardroom by day and prowls the ballroom at night. Searching for the perfect bride to usher him into the aristocracy, he abandoned the idea of love the last time he saw the delicious May Sedgwick. But when he&amp;#8217;s roped into a bet, where the prize is the means to fund his greatest ambition and the stakes are a marriage he&amp;#8217;s already planning for, Rex is willing to go all in. There&amp;#8217;s just one problem&amp;#8212;he&amp;#8217;s competing against the only woman he&amp;#8217;s ever loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only love can take it all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May Sedgwick could be the belle of the season . . . if she cared. She is more interested in the art studio than the marriage market and her craving to pursue her passion far outweighs her wish for a titled husband. Winning this bet will finally allow May to follow her true artistic desires. Rex losing is just a side benefit, as are his breathtaking kisses that she just can&amp;#8217;t resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When May is forced to choose between the dream she never knew she wanted and the man she&amp;#8217;s never been able to forget, Rex must convince her desire is worth a bit of danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Avon Romance&lt;/p&gt;" />
