  <title>A Place for Joanie - Abigail Lucie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Joanie is two years into her abstinence and lives in envy of her cock-sucking cousin TJ. One morning after he comes home caked in cum from the adult theatre he frequents, she hops online looking for similar places for horny girls like her. When she discovers that it is one in the same, she finds exactly what she is looking for&amp;hellip;and more!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I grew a little insecure with each step towards the old-fashion ticket booth. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to wear. So I made the effort to come comfortable, keeping in mind that if everything went accordingly I would go home caked in cum just like my cocksucker roommate. Apparently, I was still a little overdressed in my tightest jeans and grungy ripped tee with enough cash in my bra to get me in and buy me a couple of snacks once inside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hello.&amp;rdquo; I said courteously to the ticket agent who most certainly looked like he belonged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah,&amp;rdquo; the scruffy, overweight middle-aged white guy with nacho cheese stains across his threadbare shirt that outline a handsome pair of hairy man-boobs barked. &amp;ldquo;The theater you want is three lights down from this one the corner. Turn out on the side street instead of the thoroughfare to get there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m at the right place.&amp;rdquo; I said confidently naming the theater for him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He rolled his eyes. &amp;ldquo;Oh geez, Louise! You do know this is an adult theater, right? Home of the bow chicka bow wow, where the good old skin flicks play?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I giggled. His eyes were quite telling never meeting mine when he addressed me. &amp;ldquo;I know. Just like I know on you&amp;rsquo;re no stranger to rubbing one out to one of those flicks on your break.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He didn&amp;rsquo;t find humor in my joke. Then he grinned, &amp;ldquo;What I do in my spare time is my business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay. Got it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So you know places like these are generally frequented by perverts and the depraved looking to get off, not speed dating, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah,&amp;rdquo; I chuckled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So you also know that places like these are generally frequented by guys looking to get some action on the side usually with other guys?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Only because that&amp;rsquo;s been their only option for so long.&amp;rdquo; I gave my smart aleck reply.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, you&amp;rsquo;re one of them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;One of what?&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Behind the occasional tranny looking to fulfill her rape fantasy, there are one or two girls that come around here once or maybe twice a year looking for a new way to scratch her inner slut. When girls like you find out that that the place is littered with hard cock, especially of a certain dark variety, whores like you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to resist. Let me spare you the trouble. Unlike some of the flicks we show, real life isn&amp;rsquo;t like porn, honey. There are no directors to tell the gang banger to stop so they can get another shot from another angle. Some of these motherfuckers keep going and going until they have nothing to else to give. And that&amp;rsquo;s often long after you&amp;rsquo;ve been used up. That is, if you don&amp;rsquo;t go home crying because you had no takers.&amp;rdquo;" />
