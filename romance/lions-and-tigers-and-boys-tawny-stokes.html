  <title>Lions and Tigers and Boys - Tawny Stokes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last thing a girl as awkward as Dani Gale should be doing is trying to learn the high wire. Yet that&#39;s exactly where Dani ends up--at OZ, the Oswald Zinzendorf School of Circus Arts. Trying to overcome her shyness is near impossible when her new partner--the hottest guy she&#39;s ever laid eyes on, and whose touch seems to give her poise she thought impossible--also seems to be sabotaging her progress. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Cai Coppersmith needs is a distraction, especially in the form of the new, cute shy girl. He needs to focus on trying not to shape-shift into a tiger on school grounds, and completing his mission to keep Dani from winning the school&#39;s high-wire competition. In fact, the entire safety of OZ is relying on Dani not succeeding. But there&#39;s something about the girl that draws him in. She has magic, he can feel it. So he&#39;ll do what he can to protect her, even if it means pushing her away.&lt;/p&gt;" />
