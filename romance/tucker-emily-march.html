Her business: Bliss Bridal Salon. Her passion: Weddings. Her own wedding: It&#39;s complicated. Life isn&#39;t turning out like she&#39;d planned. The last thing she wants is for a real-life hero to ride to her rescue when an unexpected event puts her entire future in Redemption, Texas, at risk.

Maybe a new set of survival skills is exactly what she needs...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tucker McBride has been proud to call himself a U.S. Army Ranger. But now that his days of service are over, he&#39;s decided to put his expertise to use by founding a wilderness skills training school. He sets up shop in Redemption, next to Bliss Bridal, and so begins life: Part Two. Marriage has been pretty low on his agenda, but as soon as he meets Gillian, Tucker can&#39;t help but contemplate the ultimate challenge: Convincing the reluctant bride to take his hand and leap into the adventure of a lifetime. . .until death do they part. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A brilliant writer you&#39;ll love creates a world you&#39;ll never want to leave.&quot;--Susan Mallery, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
