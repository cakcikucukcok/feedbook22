  <title>Home Front - Kristin Hannah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her bestselling novels Kristin Hannah has plumbed the depths of friendship, the loyalty of sisters, and the secrets mothers keep. Now, in her most emotionally powerful story yet, she explores the intimate landscape of a troubled marriage with this provocative and timely portrait of a husband and wife, in love and at war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All marriages have a breaking point. All families have wounds. All wars have a cost. . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many couples, Michael and Jolene Zarkades have to face the pressures of everyday life---children, careers, bills, chores---even as their twelve-year marriage is falling apart. Then an unexpected deployment sends Jolene deep into harm&#39;s way and leaves defense attorney Michael at home, unaccustomed to being a single parent to their two girls. As a mother, it agonizes Jolene to leave her family, but as a solider she has always understood the true meaning of duty. In her letters home, she paints a rose-colored version of her life on the front lines, shielding her family from the truth. But war will change Jolene in ways that none of them could have foreseen. When tragedy strikes, Michael must face his darkest fear and fight a battle of his own---for everything that matters to his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At once a profoundly honest look at modern marriage and a dramatic exploration of the toll war takes on an ordinary American family, &lt;i&gt;Home Front&lt;/i&gt; is a story of love, loss, heroism, honor, and ultimately, hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Her family is the center of her life, reflected nightly on her show. With 12 kids, she can relate to callers who juggle kids, family and work. Kristin Hannah's written so many good books that I knew this one--her 20th book-- Home Front --was going to delight me.<br /><b><i>Home Front: Hannah, Kristin: 8601420089112: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Home Front is a very different matter. Talk about over-egging the cake. From the cloying, saccharin sweet outpouring of love for her children: one of whom is a caricatured, sulky, obnoxious young teen; the other a somewhat developmentally delayed four-year-old, going on five, this mushy presentation of family life seems to go on forever.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Home Front - Kristin Hannah</a> </h3></p><hr/>
