          &lt;strong&gt;“Are you going back to the party?” &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cameron looked right into her eyes. “Do you want me to go back?” Gabrielle didn’t know what to say. His question had thrown her off. “Whether you go back or not isn’t up to me.” “Well, no, I’m not interested in going back. Now if you were to ask me in, I’d accept the invite before you released your next breath.” Unsure of herself and Cameron, Gabrielle wished she could give him an answer. Telling him to go home was rude— and she wasn’t sure that was what she really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cameron didn’t give her much time to think. His urge to taste her mouth had won out over his attempt to cool himself down. Lifting her chin with two fingers, Cameron lowered his head until their lips met. To gauge her reaction, he dusted her lips with several soft kisses. Then his forefinger slowly outlined her mouth. Looking down into her mesmerizing eyes, Cameron tried to see if he’d moved too fast or been inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She appeared a bit startled but didn’t seem to object to his show of affection. The blush on her cheeks was a telltale sign. Giving it no more thought, his top lip skirted her bottom one, causing her breath to come in short spurts. She hadn’t pushed him away. He took it as a good sign and hoped he wasn’t making a mistake. He didn’t want to lose her, and he already cared enough for her to risk his heart again.&lt;/p&gt;
