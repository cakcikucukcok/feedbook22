          &lt;em&gt;They&#39;re definitely not two of a kind Have you seen this man?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ten-year-old Alex Harper is putting up posters everywhere. He wants to find his dad, but only so the judge can force the &quot;deadbeat&quot; to pay the support he owes. Maybe then his mother can stop working all the time, and she and Alex, his twin sister and little brother can finally take a real vacation together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To everyone&#39;s surprise, Alex actually finds his dad–or does he? The man calling himself Joe Smith certainly looks the part, but he claims there&#39;s been a mistake. And Frannie, Alex&#39;s mom, is willing to believe him. After all, he doesn&#39;t exactly &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt;like her ex-husband. Besides, it&#39;s said that everybody has a double somewhere. Of course, it&#39;s also said that twins run in families….&lt;/p&gt;
