  <title>Daring Miss Danvers - Vivienne Lorret</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s all fun and games &amp;#8230; until someone falls in love. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver Goswick, Viscount Rathburn, needs money&amp;#8212;and soon. With time ticking away and his inheritance held hostage until he&amp;#39;s properly wed, Rathburn&amp;#39;s slim options point to a single solution: a faux engagement. In need of the perfect bride, he knows of only one candidate: his best friend&amp;#39;s wallflower sister. The plan seems flawless, except for one problem &amp;#8230; He can&amp;#39;t help falling in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poised, polished Emma Danvers knows nothing good can come of Rathburn&amp;#39;s scheme. Spending the next two months engaged in a mock courtship is not what she&amp;#39;d imagined for her final season. Yet, charmed by his roguish ways and the inexplicable hammering he causes in her heart, she accepts his challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Emma, keeping the secret seemed easy when it was just a game &amp;#8230; But as Rathburn begins to see past her reserved exterior to the passionate woman within, the risk of losing her heart becomes all too real.&lt;/p&gt;" />
