  <title>I Only Have Fangs For You - Kathy Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Bite Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing you have to know about my brother Sebastian: he loves being a vampire. He&#39;s eternally twenty-five. He&#39;s single, and frankly, he&#39;s a chick magnet. Yeah, undeath is good. The only thing he&#39;s serious about is his nightclub, Carfax Abbey. It&#39;s the sort of dark, happening spot where vampires can really let their fangs down. My brother Rhys and I have tried to get Sebastian to clean up his bad-boy ways like we did, but then he went and called us &quot;fang-whipped.&quot; Okay, Bite Boy, chew on this.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ultimate righteous reformer, Wilhemina Weiss, is on a mission to shut down Carfax Abbey. It seems the spirited, sexy-without-knowing-it vampire is working undercover as a cocktail waitress while waging a secret war to bring him down. Sebastian&#39;s A-positive he can convince Miss Goody-Vampire-Two-Fangs that nothing beats the ecstasy of a good vampire bite. I gotta tell you, the suspense would kill me--if I weren&#39;t already undead.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A unique blend of heat, humor and heart!&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Erin McCarthy" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>I Only Have Fangs For You - Kathy Love</i></b> | I would recommend Kathy Love's I Only Have Fangs For You (and again the entire Young Brothers series) to anyone who loves vampire romance. It's adorably sweet and funny, all the characters are well developed and likable. The entire book kept me entertained, there was really no dull moment.<br /><b><i>I Only Have Fangs For You - Kindle edition by Love, Kathy ...</i></b> | Kathy Love writes for both Zebra (her Stepp Sisters trilogyâ€”Getting What You Want, Wanting What You Get, and Wanting Something More) and Brava (Fangs for the Memories, Fangs but No Fangs, I Only Have Fangs for You, and My Sister Is a Werewolf). She lives in Maryland with her beautiful daughter, Emily, a crazy Boston terrier, and a very squeaky guinea pig.<br /><b><i>I Only Have Fangs For You: Love, Kathy: 9780758211361 ...</i></b> | "I Only Have Fangs For You" is the third installment in the Young Brothers series by Kathy Love. This is my first Kathy Love novel and I was impressed. I was glad that I got this spontaneously. Sometimes the spontaneous ones are the best, huh? Sebastian is your typical vampire; Handsome, Rich, Charming, Older than he looks and popular with the ladies.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>I Only Have Fangs For You - Kathy Love</a> </h3></p><hr/>
