  <title>A Warm Winter - Priyam Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story about two people: Abhay and Anamika, who are different, yet similar to each other. They meet in the beautiful city of Chandigarh, and fall in love. But even as they do, they have their own secrets, and pasts that they do not want to share with each other. However, as the bond of love cannot be formed with the thread of lies, they do reveal their secrets, which bring back memories that they would rather lock in a dungeon. While Anamika reveals of her dowry hungry ex-husband, Abhay talks about his former love, and his true identity comes into picture. While it seems that they have come closer to each other, the cruel hand of destiny plays a game with them, so much so that their lives are wrecked and transformed completely. While Abhay realises after a year that his love is gone, Anamika becomes famous, in the world of fashion and movies. Her life looks pretty, but is hollow, until she meets Abhay again, and their worlds collide. This is a tale of highs and lows, love, friendship, trust and patience." />
