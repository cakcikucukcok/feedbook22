  <title>A Charge of Valor (Book #6 in the Sorcerer&#39;s Ring) - Morgan Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“THE SORCERER’S RING has all the ingredients for an instant success: plots, counterplots, mystery, valiant knights, and blossoming relationships replete with broken hearts, deception and betrayal. It will keep you entertained for hours, and will satisfy all ages. Recommended for the permanent library of all fantasy readers.” &lt;p&gt;--Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CHARGE OF VALOR is Book #6 in the #1 Bestselling series THE SORCERER&#39;S RING, which begins with A QUEST OF HEROES! &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In A CHARGE OF VALOR (Book #6 in the Sorcerer&#39;s Ring), Thor continues on his quest, deeper into the Empire, to retrieve the stolen Destiny Sword and save the Ring. As he and his friends meet unexpected tragedy and lose a member of their close-knit group, Thor and his remaining friends become closer than they ever were, learning that they must face and overcome adversity together. Their journey takes them to new and exotic terrains, including the desolate Salt Fields, the Great Tunnel, and the Mountains of Fire, as they face a host of unexpected monsters at every turn. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thor’s skills deepen as he undergoes his most advanced training yet, and he will need to draw on powers greater than he has ever used if he is to survive. They finally discover where the Sword has been taken, and they learn that, to retrieve it, they will have to venture to the most dreaded place in the Empire: the Land of the Dragons. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the Ring, Gwendolyn recovers slowly and grapples with deep depression after her attack. Kendrick and the others vow to fight for her honor, despite the impossible odds. There follows one of the great battles in the history of the Ring, as they struggle to free Silesia and conquer Andronicus. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Godfrey finds himself in disguise behind enemy lines and begins to come into his own, learning what it means to become a warrior, in his own, unique way. Gareth manages to stay alive, using all his cunning to avert capture by Andronicus, while Erec fights for his life to save Savaria from the oncoming invasion by Andronicus—and to save his love, Alistair. Argon pays a precious price for doing the forbidden: meddling in human affairs. And Gwendolyn must decide if she will give up on life, or take up the secluded life of a nun in the ancient Tower of Refuge. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not before, in a shocking twist, Thor finally learns who his real father is. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Thor and the others survive the quest? Will they retrieve the Destiny Sword? Will the Ring survive Andronicus’ invasion? What will become of Gwendolyn, Kendrick and Erec? And who is Thor’s real father? &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its sophisticated world-building and characterization, A CHARGE OF VALOR is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Books #7--#17 in the series are now also available! &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Grabbed my attention from the beginning and did not let go….This story is an amazing adventure that is fast paced and action packed from the very beginning. There is not a dull moment to be found.” &lt;p&gt;--Paranormal Romance Guild {regarding Turned}" />
