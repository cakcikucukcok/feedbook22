  <title>My Fair Duchess - Megan Frampton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The unexpected duchess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archibald Salisbury, son of a viscount, war hero, and proficient in the proper ways of aristocratic society, has received orders for his most challenging mission: Genevieve, Duchess of Blakesley. How she inherited a duchy isn&amp;#8217;t his problem. Turning her into a perfect duchess is. But how can he keep his mind on business when her beauty entices him toward pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was impossible, unprecedented&amp;#8230;and undeniably true. Genevieve is now a &amp;#8220;duke&amp;#8221;, or, rather, a duchess. So what is she to do when the &lt;em&gt;ton &lt;/em&gt;eyes her every move, hoping she&amp;#8217;ll make a mistake? Genevieve knows she has brains and has sometimes been told she has beauty, but, out of her depth, she calls on an expert. And &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; an expert, with shoulders broad enough to lean on, and a wit that matches her own. Archie is supposed to teach her to be a lady and run her estate, but what she really wants to do is unladylike&amp;#8212;run into his arms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
