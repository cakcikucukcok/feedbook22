  <title>A Soul in Torment - D. J Marteeny, Richard Marteeny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rick Ferrante once enjoyed a fulfilling life as a priest. Then, in one horrendous act of violence, his life full of purpose and meaning was stripped away. Now, he is a monstera vampire doomed to walk the earth for all eternity with Lucifer hot on his trail. As he parts from his mentor, Simon, and heads out into the world on his own, Rick thinks his life is an abyss of darkness. But he could not be more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangeline Meredeloupe is a savvy New York detective on the scent of a serial killer who has left a trail of mutilated bodies all the way from the city streets to the state parks in Red Rock, Pennsylvania. Like the vampire, Evangeline is something more than human herself. Compounding her troubles is her undeniable attraction to the mysterious figure she now knows is a vampire. But Evangeline isnt the only one attracted to Rick. A dark force has risen from the bowels of Hella demon so devious and cruel, she is second only to the Prince of Darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All who know Rick soon find themselves in grave danger, for the demon will stop at nothing until she gets what she wantsthe delicious paradox that is the vampire priest.&lt;/p&gt;" />
