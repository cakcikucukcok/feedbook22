  <title>Christmas Embrace - Ellen Tanner Marsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This wasn&#39;t what they imagined marriage would be...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two lonely people, Rose and Alex Boyer, once shared something special. But the pressures of their fast-track lives have pulled them apart, and they hardly know each other anymore. They&#39;re giving the marriage one last chance--a weekend at a romantic Pennsylvania country inn. Maybe if they can rekindle their love, Alex will finally settle down and give Rose the baby she desperately longs for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But from the moment their plane touches down in a raging blizzard, the weekend seems made for disaster. Old resentments surface, and the distance between them grows as icy cold as the ground. Can the season&#39;s spell help Rose and Alex see where they went wrong--and show them the way back to love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
