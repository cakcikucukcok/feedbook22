  <title>Arianne&#39;s Waltz - M. Bradley Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;LOVE IS A FOUR-LETTER WORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Stephen, love is the most frustrating word in the English language because his love for someone very special must remain hidden; revealing it could disrupt the summer music conservatory where hes a guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Andrew, love is a cruel word because he sees the girl he loves choosing to love another, and he can do nothing about itexcept resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Karen, love is a pleasant experience because she discovers someone who could become more than just a boyfriendif everything works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Judith, love is a long-awaited reward when her boyfriend finally reaches the point where he can admit he loves heras she loves him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Doug, love is a shy discovery that opens a new world. Girls havent chased him, despite his good looks, and realizing he enjoys the company of one particular girl makes the Conservatory a special experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Arianne, love is a beautiful and unexpected surprise. She encounters her first boyfriend and suddenly finds herself caring head-over-heels for someone truly special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason finds loves gentle pain because, for the first time since he met her, the Conservatory separates him from the girl hes grown to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, for someone, love is patient, love is kind, love is never envious or boastful, and love becomes a desperate hope because love may be the only thing that can halt cancers advance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join these young people and their cast of friends and family as they experience a summer of music and learn the many aspects of love in &lt;i&gt;Ariannes Waltz&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ariannes Waltz&lt;/i&gt; is the third book in the Musica Con Fuoco Series. Mr. Davis has written and published other books through AuthorHOUSE. Mr. Davis is a former teacher, and lives in the Texas Hill Country.&lt;/p&gt;" />
