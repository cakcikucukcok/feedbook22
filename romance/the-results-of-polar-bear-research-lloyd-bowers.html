  <title>The Results of Polar Bear Research - Lloyd Bowers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A tender, ribald story about relationships, THE RESULTS OF POLAR BEAR RESEARCH takes the reader to Lake Summit in the mountains of North Carolina, where college students spend the day water-skiing and the evening socializing. John Dawes secretly rues the day he has to graduate from college and enter the adult world. To John, adulthood is a wilderness of blowhards and judgmental hypocrites. The little insight he possesses, he gleans from nature and architecture, his favorite subjects. &lt;p&gt;
Harriet Smiley whom everyone calls &quot;Harry&quot; seems to be a wish come true for John. She charms him with large, vulnerable dark-green eyes and a trembling voice, the very picture of innocence. Their relationship will teach him something he could never learn from a textbook: only children have real innocence. In someone his age, it&#39;s probably something else. &lt;p&gt;" />
