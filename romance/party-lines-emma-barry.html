      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;It&#39;s not personal&amp;#8212;it&#39;s politics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Michael Picetti: a cynical Democrat who has seen too many failed campaigns. It&#39;s not his first primary, and it&#39;s been a while since he&#39;s truly believed policy and public good trump all.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Lydia Reales: young, hard-working, optimistic&amp;#8230;Republican. Getting her candidate in office means everything to her, and leaves zero time for a love life.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Both are determined that opposites &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; attract&amp;#8212;at least when it comes to crossing party lines. As aides for opposing presidential candidates, Michael and Lydia are competing in an industry that requires total loyalty to their side. It doesn&#39;t matter that with each teasing encounter they&#39;re more and more attracted to each other. It doesn&#39;t matter that casual flirting escalates to a powerful physical connection. It doesn&#39;t matter that they might not be able to step away from each other without consequences.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;As the campaign rages on and a reckless affair becomes a relationship, the inevitable reality sets in. In the end, loyalty to the campaign has to win. It doesn&#39;t matter at what cost.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;72,000 words" />
