  <title>Avalon Summer - David Matson Hooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Avalon Summer is a coming-of-age summer romance set in 1965 in the resort town of Avalon, Santa Catalina Island. On the brink of adulthood, three men and four women experience love, heartbreak, and self-discovery against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, the Watts race riots, and Top 40 radio.&lt;/p&gt; 
Sil: Surfer, womanizer, and draft dodger. His motto, never in love, only in heat, is about to be challenged.&lt;/br&gt; 
Candy: The beautiful young actress, driven by ambition, and haunted by the past.&lt;/br&gt; 
J. T.: A black man trying to succeed in a white mans world, and tempted by forbidden love.&lt;/br&gt; 
Donna: Looking for love in all the wrong places, and harboring a dark secret.&lt;/br&gt; 
Lynn: She came to Avalon for a change of scenery, but found romance instead.&lt;/br&gt; 
Waxie: Easy-going teen now torn between his family and the girl he loves.&lt;/br&gt; 
Jimmy: Sensitive and brooding, he has this one last summer to mend a broken heart before going off to war.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Their lives will intersect in Avalon, and they will discover truths about themselves, life, and love on the Island of Romance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
