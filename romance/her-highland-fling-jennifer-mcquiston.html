  <title>Her Highland Fling - Jennifer McQuiston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let the Games Begin &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William MacKenzie has always been protective of his Scottish village. When Moraig&amp;#39;s economy falters, he has the perfect solution to lure wealthy Londoners to this tiny hamlet: resurrect the ancient Highland Games! But for this to work, William knows he needs a reporter to showcase the town in just the right light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A female journalist might be a tolerated oddity in Brighton, but newly minted reporter Penelope Tolbertson is discovering that finding respect in London is a far more difficult prospect. After receiving an invitation to cover Moraig&amp;#39;s Highland Games, Penelope is determined to prove to her London editors just how valuable she can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penelope instantly captures William&amp;#39;s heart, but she is none too impressed with the gruff, broody Highlander; however, as she begins to understand his plans, Penelope discovers she may want more from him than just a story. She&amp;#39;s only got a few days &amp;#8230; but maybe a few days are all they need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
