  <title>Interviews, Sex and Responsability (#5 of California Dreaming) A Los Angeles Series - Andrew J. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Alliston, famous writer of Unforgivable, the novel that made him famous throughout the literary scene in Los Angeles, seems to have finally overcome his &quot;creative block&quot;. Intended to go on with his life, after Karen, the woman he loved and left him, settled in Los Angeles and seems to have regained his lost identity. Stacy, his old flame, along with the help of his best friend and literary agent, Andy Jackson, will help James get back into the car. After a charity gathering on behalf of one of the most famous Los Angeles magazines, chairman and shareholder John Craimer offers him a job in his company, and although he refuses the job at the beginning, Stacy says that could be a possibility to so that he starts to get serious again. The events, since James has moved, seem to take him to the right path, and found, all of a sudden, his essential desire to write begins to throw down a few lines, discovering later that those drafts could become a next editorial case. And with commitment and perseverance, James is making sure to patch up the pieces of a whole life sent to ruin. Now, however, the commitments seem more burdensome than when he moved, leaving him very little room for himself. Between spicy interviews with young and sexy journalists, editorial bosses decidedly attractive and out of the ordinary, James will be mixed up in decidedly pushed scenarios, not forgetting the irony inherent in his usual ways of doing which differentiate him from the countless writers who hang out the scene Literary of Los Angeles. A desirable fifth episode to read in a breath, amusing scenes, tantalizing that will enjoy in the mind of the reader a scenario to live in the role of the famous and sexy novelist. " />
