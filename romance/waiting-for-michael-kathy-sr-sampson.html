      <meta name="description" content="The circumstances are right, the opportunity has presented itself.  Now, all she needs is a plan and she can be free of the humiliation, the abuse, and of him.

They will come to her soon, a piece at a time.  And as they do, the night will grow darker, the fear greater and her determination will crumble.  She will want to stop it, to go back to the way things were, only it is far too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, she finds herself alone, terrified and running in fear!
