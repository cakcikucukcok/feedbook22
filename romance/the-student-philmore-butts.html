  <title>The Student - Philmore Butts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Student&quot; relates the story of Adam Harris as he navigates some of the challenges that may be part of a certain phase of experience. You take into account an understanding of human nature, paying special attention to the process normally associated with finding, keeping, or reconciling the seeming complexities of a bond with another person. The story implicitly raises questions about a range of issues, from identity and vocation to family bonds, friendship, and courage.
Being &quot;committed&quot; to his textbooks seemingly opens Adam to &quot;all sorts of criticisms&quot; at school, but he refrain from letting it &quot;bother him.&quot; Things seem to shift a bit after he decides &quot;an out-of-state university would be a better choice&quot;  and leaves Chicago, spending time with his aunt&#39;s family &quot;in a Detroit suburb.&quot;He feels an &quot;overwhelming excitement&quot; upon arriving on campus. He starts spending some time with &quot;Ms. Daly,&quot; but a diagnosis of pregnancy evokes a few questions for him, particularly when she decides to  &quot;keep the baby.&quot; Adam explains to his parents and his mother says that given the circumstance, the &quot;pregnancy must be meant to be but he hesitates about the possibility of marriage. Adam has &quot;feelings&quot; for Lisa, yet from his perspective, the &quot;timing&quot; seem to be &quot;all wrong.&quot; When he meets his son, he tells Lisa, &quot;Nothing that I&#39;ve experienced in Michigan  has made me happier.&quot; While Lisa becomes &quot;more familiar with the duties of being a full time mom,&quot; Adam is &quot;busy. . .with his classes&quot; and they both focus on &quot;raising their child.&quot; As the work progresses, Adam and Lisa confront a range of experiences. They begin to feel &quot;closer&quot; to one another, but his remaining time at college  includes seeing &quot;various girls,&quot; some of which tend to want &quot;more than he can offer.&quot;" />

The story implicitly raises questions about a range of issues, from identity and vocation to family bonds, friendship, and courage. Being "committed" to his textbooks seemingly opens Adam to "all sorts of criticisms" at school, but he refrain from letting it "bother him." Things seem to shift a bit after he decides "an out-of-state university would be a better choice" and leaves Chicago, spending time with his aunt's family "in a Detroit suburb."He feels an "overwhelming excitement" upon arriving on campus. He starts spending some time with "Ms. Daly," but a diagnosis of pregnancy evokes a few questions for him, particularly when she decides to "keep the baby." Adam explains to his parents and his mother says that given the circumstance, the "pregnancy must be meant to be but he hesitates about the possibility of marriage. Adam has "feelings" for Lisa, yet from his perspective, the "timing" seem to be "all wrong." When he meets his son, he tells Lisa, "Nothing that I've experienced in Michigan has made me happier."
