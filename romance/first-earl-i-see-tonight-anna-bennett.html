  <title>First Earl I See Tonight - Anna Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time three young ladies vowed to record their first London seasons...and to fill in the gaps of their finishing school educations. Thus began &lt;/i&gt;The Debutante Diaries&lt;i&gt;--and London will never be the same...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Fans of Regency rom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ance authors Eloisa James, Tessa Dare, and Mary Jo Putney will go wild.&quot;--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An heiress with a daring proposal.  An earl who&#39;s determined to resist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;her. And a love that just might be written in the stars, in First Earl I See Tonight by Anna Bennett.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently jilted by his fiancée, David Gray, Earl of Ravenport is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in the market for a wife. Even if Gray didn&#39;t have his hands full renovating his crumbling country house, it would take more than a bold marriage proposal from a headstrong young beauty to thaw his frozen heart. Gray is confident that spending a week at his ramshackle estate will change her mind about marriage, but every passionate moment he spends with her tempts him to change his...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A talented artist, Miss Fiona Hartley desperately needs her dowry money to pay off a blackmailer set on ruining her sister. The handsome earl seems a sensible choice for a husband...if only she can convince him that romance will play no part. But marrying in name only may prove difficult for Fiona. Gray can&#39;t help but be dazzled by her genuine warmth. Yet as their feelings deepen, Fiona&#39;s deadline looms. Will her secrets destroy them, or is true love their final destiny?&lt;/p&gt;" />
