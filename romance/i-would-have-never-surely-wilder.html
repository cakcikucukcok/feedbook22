  <title>I Would Have Never - Surely Wilder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Surely Wilder creates a stirring and sensual tale of love and romance set in the early days of the Civil War. Knowing that her young man may be asked to give the ultimate sacrifice and shed his blood on the battlefield, Suzanna is determined to give him a memory to cherish. She is willing to offer him her maiden head, to shed her blood, and to give him comfort and hope for an uncertain future. See how their love grows in this erotic tale of Southern charm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would have never understood the elation of flirting while dancing, and singing, and talking to so many wonderful people. I was stunned when Maybelle handed me a dance card that had fifteen names upon it. She told me that I would be the prize of the evening, and all my beaus would be looking forward to their time with me. She even hinted that there was another list she could make for me if I enjoyed my time with you. I kissed her lightly as I understood she intended to give memories to as many of our gallant lads as she could that night, but I only wanted one partner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I began dancing with the decreed individuals and was instantly mesmerized as each gentleman did their best to compliment me, and test my skill in dance. Little did they know that their efforts were seducing me to Maybelle&amp;rsquo;s plan. In another time and place I might have joined her, but this night was ours. I know that several times I was left breathless from their energetic moves, but in truth, each dance partner only reminded me of how much I wanted the final song where you and I would be coupled together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the boys gazed longingly into my eyes, I allowed their flirtation to build my desire for you. Throughout the night, I stole glances to spy upon you. You were the most elegant of all the boys, and I felt my loins moisten all the more, as I realized the moment of our union was fast approaching, and I would share the most intimate dance of the night with you." />
