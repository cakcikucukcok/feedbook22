  <title>October - Michael Rowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The time: the waning years of the 1990s at the dawn of the millennium.&lt;br&gt;
The place: an isolated rural town called Auburn, which could be anywhere at all—a town where everyone knows everyone else—where dark secrets run through its veins like blood.&lt;br&gt;
Everyone knows that sixteen-year old Mikey Childress is “different.” A target for bullies since he was a small boy, everything Mikey does attracts abuse: the way he walks, the way he talks, the way he looks. Everyone knows he’s not like the other boys in Auburn—the boys who play hockey, who fight, the boys who pursue girls. Only his friend Wroxy, a girl almost as isolated as he is, can even guess at the edges of his pain, or the depths of his yearning for love.&lt;br&gt;
But even the people who hate Mikey couldn’t dream of how many secrets he has, or how badly he could hurt them if he wanted to.&lt;br&gt;
Until the night Mikey is pushed beyond endurance by his abusers. The night he makes a pact with dark forces older than time to visit a terrible vengeance on his enemies. The night he inadvertently opens a doorway that should never, ever have been opened, and unleashes something into the world that should have remained damned.&lt;br&gt;
From Michael Rowe, the Shirley Jackson Award-nominated author of &lt;i&gt;Wild Fell&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Enter, Night&lt;/i&gt; comes a Faustian tale of the horrific cost of the murder of innocence in a small town, and of the vicious price extracted for the ultimate revenge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
