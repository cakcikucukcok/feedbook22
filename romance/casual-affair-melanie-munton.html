  <title>Casual Affair - Melanie Munton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bea Paxton is a free spirit. She loves her fledgling interior design business, having fun, and she loves men. But only temporarily. Rule #1 is no relationships, no love, no commitment. She likes being in charge. It&#39;s the only way to protect herself from getting hurt again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zane Price is the perfect candidate for a steamy time--beautiful, built, and British. Plus, he&#39;ll soon be moving back to England. &lt;i&gt;Really&lt;/i&gt; perfect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well...except for the fact that he&#39;s her biggest client. And he doesn&#39;t play by her rules. Hell, no. He wants more. &lt;i&gt;Much&lt;/i&gt; more. Which is definitely not on the agenda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, his kisses are nothing short of toe-curlingly awesome. And he is distracting her--a lot--from doing her job. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She needs to stay away from him. Her livelihood depends on it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Zane always gets what he wants. And he wants Bea. But for right now? Or forever...?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Slow Seductions series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Casual Affair&lt;br&gt;* Sweet Attraction&lt;/p&gt;" />
