          &lt;strong&gt;Bargained Into Her Boss’s Bed &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the fast-paced, cut-throat world of Hollywood, producer Max Hudson has a movie deadline breathing down his neck – when his gorgeous assistant, Dana Fallon, suddenly resigns, wreaking havoc! No amount of money will sway her decision – but, luckily, Max has other means of persuasion…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Propositioned Into a Foreign Affair&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Publicly, Bella Hudson had the world at her feet. Privately, her life was in turmoil: a humiliating breakup, paparazzi at her heels… The Hollywood starlet needed to escape. Then she found a night of pleasure – media-free – in hotel magnate Sam Garrison’s bed. Only Sam wanted more and he was willing to do anything to keep her!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Seduced Into a Paper Marriage&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No one ever denied Devlin Hudson. The boss of Hudson Pictures could have any woman he wanted, until his prim and proper wife, Valerie Shelton, walked out on their matrimonial merger. Devlin wasn’t going to rest until he got her back! And this time he vowed to win her over the old-fashioned way…in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
