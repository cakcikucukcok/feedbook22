  <title>Fire in the Bosque - Barbara Spencer Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beautiful Lorena Rogers has it all: a successful husband, a lovely home, and professional security. Outwardly it appears that she has accomplished all her goals. But she realizes that what she thought would make her happy is now shallow and unsatisfying. To escape her empty existence, she returns to the ranch on the Rio Grande River where she was born and reared. As she cares for her terminally ill mother, she hopes to be able to resolve the frustrations in her life. She soon learns to enjoy some of the simple pleasures of ranch living as she resumes her horseback riding and dusts off her guitar and starts singing again. Unexpectedly, she renews the friendship of her first love in high school who has progressed from being a star basketball player to running the affairs of her home town as its mayor. Then it happens, the ultimate dread for those who live along the river--the fire in the Bosque. Amid the destruction, could there be resolution and a new beginning for Rena? BARBARA SPENCER FOSTER says, &quot;I always knew I wanted to write. However, my writing career could come only after my profession and my family. Finally I was free to begin in 1998. I enjoy preserving the enchanted stories of my beloved native state, New Mexico.&quot; The author is at home in Santa Fe and Townsend, Montana." />
