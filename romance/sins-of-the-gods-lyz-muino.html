  <title>Sins of the Gods - Lyz Muino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Events from past lives in ancient Egypt and revolutionary France continue to torment Helena in her current life. As a young widow in New York City, Helena is having a long love affair with Charles. He is a married man and a prosperous psychologist. 
The book opens on regression therapy sessions conducted by Charles. Under hypnosis, Helena relives a past life in France when she had a passionate romance with Martin. She realizes Charles is the reincarnation of Martin. 
As France plunged into the brutality of the revolution, her home in France was attacked by troops under the command of Monsieur Antoine. He ordered the killing of her entire family and confiscated their land. 
She concocted a plan for revenge, but meanwhile, Martin was forced by his family to marry another woman. She kept waiting for Martin to fulfill his promise to return so that they could escape together, but she was kidnapped and sold as a slave to Monsieur Antoine. 
Helena is haunted by those traumatic memories as she lives between the past and the present. She seeks answers to her conflicts through prayers. She hypnotizes herself and encounters spiritual masters who take her to even more remote memories. She learns that her romance with Charles started in ancient Egypt during a battle for the throne among the pharaohs. Helena and Charles still have a mission to complete before they can be happy together." />
