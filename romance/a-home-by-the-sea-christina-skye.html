          &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes appearances aren&#39;t what they seem…&lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Grace Lindstrom has followed her fiancé across three continents, starry-eyed in love and full of hope. But when Grace realizes the life she&#39;s been living is nothing but a lie, she returns home to Summer Island, the sleepy town where she grew up, to put the pieces of her life back together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By day, she perfects rare chocolate recipes for a new book. By night, she helps her father at his veterinary clinic—until the moment Sam Walker comes into her life. Just home from duty in Afghanistan, Sam has too much baggage of his own to deal with a heartbroken chef. But when a violent storm traps them together for a night, he learns there&#39;s more to Grace than he imagined—and suddenly, she&#39;s all that matters….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Complex and multi-faceted…Skye has written one finely crafted, very romantic love story.&quot; —&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly on Bride of the Mist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
