  <title>A Touch of Faith - Kathleen Schipper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mary OConnor is lost in a series of dead-end jobs with no idea what she wants to do when she grows up. While her friends are getting on with their lives, she is only going through the motions of hers. She wonders if her dreams may offer some insight into her future. After her most recent nightmare, she decides that its time to move on. She will go back to college, a decision her best friend Susan believes will change Marys life for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they have no idea how much Mary going back to finish college is about to turn their lives upside down. As her new college career unfolds, she learns of the reason St. Anthonys College recruited her: she has psychic abilities and hidden powers. Little does she know that lives now depend upon these abilitiesalong with her choices. And the fate of a betrayer lies in her hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labeled a quitter at a young age, Mary must face her inner demons, along with the outer ones who are closing in on her. An evil plague is spreading. It is almost too much for her to handle. Will her touch of faith be enough to save the man she loves, or is his tortured soul primed for the taking? &lt;/p&gt;" />
