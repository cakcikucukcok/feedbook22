  <title>Dark Storm Rising - Eva Fischer-Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dark Storm Rising
In this sequel to The Third Cloud, Michael McCloskey was returned into action by the order of the highest authority. While Michael is facing the loss of a loved one, Michelle N. Damus, a beautiful young French woman is having visions that send her to the Vatican in Rome to meet Pope John Joseph in a private audience. During the day of the popes first official visit to the USA, where Michelle also accompanies him, the newly elected president of the United States, Edward Trumpton, announces a new law that he signed that very morning, taking all the rights away from the countrys Muslim population to worship and to own businesses and forcing them to wear special identifications. As the president unleashes the first part of his plan, the Israeli Mossad discovers that four nuclear warheads were sold to a new Islamic terrorist organization who wants the pope in exchange for defusing the warheads. When during a meeting, the pope disagrees with President Trumpton, all hell broke loose, and it starts with the attempt to kidnap and/or to kill the pope, who barely escapes. After the first two nuclear explosions, there is no doubt that President Trumpton is the Antichrist that was feared of coming, and that he has even bigger plans for global domination at any cost. The group, which includes Michaels father and friend, Robert Powers and Timothy Mattheson, and General Ofarim, an Israeli officer with Michelle, must focus on preventing a worldwide disaster that includes the plagues of Egypt. As Michelle and Michael began to develop feelings for each other, Michael forces himself to concentrate on the mission that was bestowed upon him from the highest authority through a messenger, even if it means sacrificing his own life in the process." />
