  <title>The Lone Gypsy - Heather Ashley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After entering into the dark night of the soul as a child, Savannah Taylor goes back to the cemetery, where it all began twenty years ago. While there, she thinks back on her life to figure out how to find the light once and for all, starting with the times when she came to realize the changes she needed to make in order to come alive after long feeling dead inside. From there, she sets out on a journey to ultimately find happiness, home, and her reason for being, while having faith that this path will finally lead to the fate that has awaited her. Along the way, she is told she will get her happily-ever-after, which is put to the test by a new romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through reflection, her inner process of trying to deal with the internal struggle on ones own by way of metaphysical practices and a spiritual outlook is revealed. From following her own path to overcoming her fears, to sacrificing everything for her dreams and strong sense of purpose gained from a devastating loss. She tries to trust her intuition, while going back and forth between hope and despair, walking the harder paths as an idealist who refuses to settle in life and love. She knows she needs to fulfill her destiny to awaken her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
