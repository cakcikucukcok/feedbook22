  <title>Just When... - G. L. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Off the heels of a failed relationship, small town boy Tristan Smith decides a change of scenery is due. Armed with his new degree and a few bucks in his pocket, Tristan moves to Atlanta, Georgia. Life has got to be better in Atlanta, Tristan thinks to himself. Considering Atlanta is the black gay capital of America, Tristan feels he should have no problem fitting in. Unfortunately, Tristan finds out that big cities come with big problems. 
Initially, Tristan settles in nicely, landing a great job as an event planner and making friends with Kim, Eric, and Tyler, whom he meets through his college friend and new roommate, Rashawn. Tristan even begins dating again. However, the good life doesnt last long. Soon things take a turn for the worse. Someone promises to steal everything Tristan has worked so hard for, including love.
Atlanta native Kim is a no nonsense kind of girl with a body that even Beyonce would envy and a personality that makes your heart melt. She has learned how to maintain her sweet persona yet still demand respect, except when it comes to her no good baby daddy, Kevin. Kevin just doesnt want to do right, selling drugs to make a living and using the money to support his drinking habit. Kim is fed up. She is tired of Kevin, shes tired of doing hair, and she wants love. Hell, she deserves love. Kim is looking for love, but is love looking for her? And then it happens; the man of her dream walks into her life. However, Just When everything looks to be falling into place, something tragic happens that threatens to turn her life upside down!" />
