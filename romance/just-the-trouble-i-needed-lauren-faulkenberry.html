  <title>Just the Trouble I Needed - Lauren Faulkenberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a little trouble&amp;mdash;and a lot of Louisiana heat&amp;mdash;can help you find your way&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kate McDonnell has a problem: a problem with four legs and a howl loud enough to wake the whole Bayou. She can&amp;rsquo;t remember why she agreed to dogsit her best friend&amp;rsquo;s Catahoula, until sexy Sheriff Andre Dufresne stops by and her memories come right back. But Kate can&amp;rsquo;t get seriously involved with anyone right now&amp;mdash;she just got cheated on by her scoundrel fianc&amp;eacute;, and besides, Bayou Sabine is just a temporary refuge. Maybe Andre would be interested in a light-hearted fling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When Andre Dufresne first met Kate, she was naked as a jaybird and tried to brain him with her hairdryer. But that was months ago. Now, all he wants is to get to know her better. After all, they don&amp;rsquo;t make girls like her where he comes from&amp;mdash;whip-smart, fast-talking, straight-shooting, and foxy as all get out. He has his work cut out for him though&amp;mdash;Kate is no country girl. She might like him all right, but she can&amp;rsquo;t stop talking about going home.&lt;br /&gt;
Kate can&amp;rsquo;t resist a short-lived affair with Andre, and Andre isn&amp;rsquo;t about to tell Kate no. Can he convince her that he&amp;rsquo;s worth the trouble? Or will her fear of being hurt again ruin any chance they&amp;nbsp;have of love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
