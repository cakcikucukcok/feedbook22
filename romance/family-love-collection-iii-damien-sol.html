  <title>Family Love Collection III - Damien Sol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Three incestuous tales to titillate your mind. These erotic taboo stories of incest include deviant mother son sex and forbidden aunt with nephew incest romance for your enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fuck! Mmmhmm! Yes. Yes. Taste it! Taste the woman that&amp;rsquo;s going to be fucking you.&amp;rdquo; I was stunned to say the least. My mother cussing, what has the world coming to. The horror I tell you. I glanced up and was meet with one of the most wonderous things any man could be so gracious gifted to see. I began to ponder if this was what Eden looked like as I gazed upon those lofty orbs. To watch that angelic face as she bathed in the sheer elation, to be free to live in that moment now that one had come to partake in this most holy of tasks. As those heavenly orbs rose so did my own pleasure as I was finally able to make that divine voice sing as my lips gently tugged on those moist lips. &amp;ldquo;F-f-fuck,&amp;rdquo; my mother hissed in this chaotic twitch as my fingers slowly pulling my mother&amp;rsquo;s labia a part. Her canal clenched as my hot breath teased her entrance. Her thighs quaked in anticipation of the secret treasure I was meant to find. &amp;ldquo;YES!&amp;rdquo; my mother howled as her hips lifted off the bed. The sweet ambrosia began to gather waiting for its brethren in its long sacred pilgrimage. The heaven shook, thunderous beats echoed out, the cosmos was in chaos as the spark began to grow, to flicker to life. Hurricanic wind drew pass my ears as that goddess before me prepared to speak to the one praying at her altar. &amp;ldquo;William!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was the chosen as that hand held me in place. That sweet nectar began to flow, to taunt my noise from the days that had been denied such bliss. My tongue curled out parting her lips to taste the gift this goddess had so graciously bequeath me. Her fingers weaved through strands of my hair. That once holy being now was curled, her chest heaved a slight sheen of sweat clung to her skin as she sat up. I dared to chance my luck to truly gaze at this goddess who has allowed this simple pilgrim to taste the nectar of the gods. What I saw in those hungry, predatory, sinful eyes&amp;hellip; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t her sadness that was certain. The way those hypnotic violet eyes flared as the beast had been awoken, and there was only one thing she wanted, or that was the feeling I got as I stared deeply into her soul.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes baby, do you like the taste of your&amp;hellip;?!&amp;rdquo; I answered her question as I rolled my tongue within that hot canal foretelling the bountiful gifts I was about to receive. The heavens quaked and thundered as that spark began to build again. I always thought that I was the indeed lucky one to ever know a woman like this. Again my mirth rose as that angel sang. I have mentioned this before this is about my mother not about my own satisfaction. &amp;ldquo;Oh&amp;hellip; god, oh&amp;hellip; god,&amp;rdquo; my mother gulped as I renewed my assault. Her thighs gently squeezed my head as her body embraced me, wrapping me in her warmth as my mother slowly rocked her hips as I sought for that hidden treasure. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s it, that&amp;rsquo;s the spot that needs your touch baby,&amp;rdquo; my mother cooed sweetly as she struggled for breath. My eyes were awash in that holy light as she held the sun&amp;rsquo;s rays enthralled." />
