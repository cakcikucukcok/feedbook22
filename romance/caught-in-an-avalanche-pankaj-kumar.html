  <title>Caught in an Avalanche - Pankaj Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was the autumn of year 1995, in the valley of Kashmir, the ancient land of saints and sages. The situation in the valley had taken a turn. In 1989, after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, insurgency broke out in Kashmir, a great number of militants got disengaged from Afghanistan. The ISI combined this force with indigenous militants and put them in the valley with arms and weapons. The period up till 1994 was one of great turmoil. A large number of youth were brainwashed and sent across the line of control for training in militant activities. By the midnineties, when the militancy was beginning to be tamed and democracy was set to return, the ISI made huge efforts once again to stall the democratic process. About that time, a young and dynamic army officer was deployed with his company in a small border village to stop the increased infiltration along the line of control. It was a task cut out for the zealous and tactically brilliant soldier. But it was not easy; soon  he realized that military maneuvers dont always win battles. Life is an unending succession of conflicts. However, life is not about conflicts; it is about resolutions. 
The village and its people befriend the major. Amongst them are Rashida and her terrorist brother, Faisal, and the lovable young boy, Moinuddin. 
It is a story of lovean unusual romance between two people who are so different and diverse yet so similar at the core." />
