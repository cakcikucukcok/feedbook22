Still in mourning for her brother, whose tragic death due to strong drink drives her to speak out on the subject, Marissa cannot think of romance. Yet Grant&#39;s charm draws her in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Intrigued by the pensive young woman, Grant determines he must learn more about her. But he never expected to find her protesting his family&#39;s vineyard! When he learns her reasons, he&#39;s sympathetic, but Grant can&#39;t walk away from the business that supports his family and provides his mother a home. How can he choose between his and Marissa&#39;s growing love and his family&#39;s very livelihood?" />
