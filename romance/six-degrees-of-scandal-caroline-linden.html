      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Olivia Townsend is in trouble and out of options. Pursued by a dangerous man in search of a lost treasure she doesn&amp;#8217;t possess, she&amp;#8217;s got only two things in her favor: her late husband&amp;#8217;s diary, which she was never meant to see&amp;#8230; and the man who was her first&amp;#8212;and only&amp;#8212;love. Losing him broke her heart, though she&amp;#8217;s been careful to hide it for the last ten years. But when he comes to her aid and vows to stand by her, no matter what, she can&amp;#8217;t help but hope things will be different for them this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Weston has blamed himself for letting Olivia down when she needed him years ago, and now he&amp;#8217;ll do whatever it takes to keep her safe&amp;#8212;and to win her trust again. He&amp;#8217;s confident he can outwit the villain chasing Olivia. But being so near her again threatens to expose every secret in his heart &amp;#8230; even those that he swore would stay hidden forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
